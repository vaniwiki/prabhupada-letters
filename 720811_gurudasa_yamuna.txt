Vrndavana

My dear Gurudasa and Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two letters from Yamuna dated July 22, 1972, and August 6, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the plans for Vrndavana, enclosed please find the plans drawn by Saurabha which I like very much. You may submit these plans to the municipal council, as they are drawn. The plan of Mr. Suri is too much burdensome and costly, he simply wanted his 2 1/2% commission, so he has befooled these Americans. Better if our own men design and build the temple in our way. So I like these plans from Saurabha very much, and you may submit them as they are.

Now do everything in Vrndavana very peacefully, and always cooperate with each other at all times. There is some trouble with Satchitananda, he informs me you are trying to drive him away because he has written that letter about Yamuna, so that should not be the case. Better to cooperate all of you and do something tangible for Krsna. Stop this fighting. Have a European preaching center and try to enlist all the hippies and tourists who come to Vrndavana. Give them nice prasadam, engage them in chanting, cleaning the temple, reading our books, and give them all facilities for becoming devotees.

I have received a letter from Acarya das, dated 3rd August, 1972, and you may convey my blessings to him.

Hoping this meets you all in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
