My dear Sivananda Prabhu,

Please accept my greetings. I am very glad to receive your Bengali letter, and I hope; you will excuse me that I am replying you in English, because it saves much of my time. I have already advised the editor of __Back To Godhead__ to send you copies of the paper regularly. The subscription fee is $5.00 per 12 issues, and you can send the exchange to the following address: ISKCON PRESS, 504 East 6th Avenue, New York, NY 10003. Please include your distinct name and address, so you will get the paper regularly.

You have inquired about my books, and the facts are that before I came here from India, I published three volumes of __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ each of about 400 pages. Since I have come here, many manuscripts are prepared for printing, and I have published __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ published by MacMillan and __Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ published by International Society for Krishna Consciousness. We are selling our books nicely here, and if you can organize a means of selling our magazine and books in India, it will be a great help to our activities. One of my disciples, Acyutananda Brahmacari is already there in India, and if you think seriously to help me in this movement, he will also join you. The difficulty is that the books and magazines are costly in the estimation of the Indian exchange. The standard exchange is 7.5 Rs per dollar, so you consider and let me know if you can help us.

You have mentioned about the disagreement amongst our god-brothers, and it is a fact. But so far as I am concerned, I am trying to execute my humble bit, and if somebody disagrees in these activities, what can I do? But so far I get their letters, they fully appreciate the work going on here, and I do not know who is the gentleman against these activities.

I will be happy to hear from you again soon. Hope this will find you in good health.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
