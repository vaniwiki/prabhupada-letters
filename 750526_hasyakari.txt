My dear Hasyakari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 17, 1975 and have noted the contents. If the GBC has no objection to your going to India to help with the cow program, then I encourage you to go there. This program is very very important. If you can help to organize our cow program in Mayapur, it will be a great credit for you. We must be able to grow our own fodder for the cows. We don't want to have to purchase food for the cows outside from some other party. That will run into a great expense. Cow protection is the business of the vaisyas and along with our preaching, this is the most important work. We must have a good section of Brahmanas in our society and we must also have a good group of vaisyas who can grow grains and tend cows, and thus supply the society with food-grains and milk products from the cow like ghee, curd, cream, etc. If you can help in Mayapur it would be very much appreciated.

I have accepted the devotees you have recommended for initiation. Their names are: Stephen---Sundarakara, Janet---Jaganmurti, Patricia---Premaka. Their beads may be chanted by Kirtanananda Swami. The thread for Phanamandita dasa is enclosed and the mantra sheet is also enclosed with the gayatri mantra. Let Siladitya devi, Mahavegavati devi, and Phanamandita dasa all hear the tape of myself chanting the gayatri mantra through the right ear. Make sure that these boys and girls follow very carefully all of the rules and regulations, as well as chant 16 rounds daily and read my books carefully.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
