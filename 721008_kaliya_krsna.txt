My dear Kaliya Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 31, 1972, and have noted the contents.

Now that you are President of the Detroit Temple, you have very great responsibility to take proper care of all the devotees who are engaged there and are spreading Krsna Consciousness at one of our most important centers. Formerly Bhagavan das was developing this area very nicely, so now that the responsibility is in your hands please continue with enthusiasm more and more. As much as you are sincere to simply serve the mission of the Supreme Lord, then Krsna will give you the intelligence from the heart, have no doubt. I have received the enclosed daksina offering in the amount of $332 and I thank you very very much. Also enclosed is a letter for Srimati Vilasini Devi Dasi and Sitarani Devi Dasi for Gayatri initiation.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
