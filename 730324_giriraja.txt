My dear Giriraja:

Please accept my blessings.

We want money for purchasing the land, about $130,000. Last time you attempted to take loan from the bank, but this was not fruitful because Srimati Morarji would not stand as guarantor. So, if you agree to return back the money with interest ($130,000) to our Mayapur construction work, then I shall arrange the money from USA.

Atreya Rsi is bringing this letter so you can talk with him and do the needful.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
