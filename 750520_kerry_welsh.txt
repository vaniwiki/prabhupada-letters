My dear Kerry,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note and your hand-knitted sweater gift. Thank you very much for this sweater. I have been using it here in Melbourne as it is a little cold here. Please continue living nicely in Krishna Consciousness, chanting 16 rounds daily minimum, rising early, following the rules and regulations, reading my books, and make your life perfect. Regarding your initiation, I will be pleased to accept you as my disciple if Tusta Krishna Swami gives me his recommendation. It appears from your letter that you are following everything very nicely, so if Tusta Krishna Maharaja will recommend you to me, then I will be very happy to accept both you and your wife for first initiation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
