My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 24th July, 1971 and after such a long time. I was a little shocked when I understood that you left the London temple for taking care of your wife. I do not know what is the disease of your wife but when I was in London she was doing very nicely and personally serving me also. I was very pleased. Why she has developed this tendency to give up Krishna Consciousness?

I was so pleased to know that since Gurudasa had left London you had taken charge of our temple there, but later on you again left, so what can I do? I shall always pray that wherever you remain, you will continue your Krishna Consciousness and follow the rules and regulations. Now I am going to London very soon and after coming back I will be going to L.A. So you can come and see me at that time along with your wife and stay for some time. That will be very nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
