My dear Revatinandana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of 25th May, 1974. It is very good news that you are out preaching free from too much entanglement in temple life. That is your proper engagement and I am glad to hear you are touring to 120 colleges.

Now cooperate with Hansadutta. This is Krsna's business. We shouldn't form different parties. Hansadutta is a sincere worker and has given evidence of success in Germany. Now Syamasundara has relinquished his position and I am enclosing a copy of my letter to him in this connection. Try to pacify all the opposing elements and you will also make me happy.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
