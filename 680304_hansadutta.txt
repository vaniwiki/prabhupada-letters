====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I offer the same to my daughter, Himavati, and I hope she is doing well. I am very glad that Krishna is already dictating you how to make perfect the SANKIRTANA party. I completely agree with you about the program of our traveling across the country, being booked in several places. And I am glad that our friend, Allen Ginsberg, is helping you. There is no doubt about our success if we can make this Kirtana party successful. The most important point in this connection is that we shall never be professional; that is to say, we shall try to make the Kirtana party perfect from the point of view of Krishna Consciousness. The idea of introducing Panca-tattva in the kirtana party was also contemplated by me. Not only that, we have to prepare different dresses for Radha and Krishna, and Their eight confidential Associates, Sakhis. Sometimes you have to dress somebody as Nrsimhadeva and Prahlada; in this way, we shall have varieties of show along with the kirtana, and all the varieties will be picked up from __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ and __Bhagavad-gita.__ We have to teach the Brahmacaris and the Brahmacarinis to speak in Sanskrit some of the verses in this connection, and we explain the verses by singing, chanting, and speaking also. Sometimes in the middle of chanting and singing, we shall speak also. So, all these varieties show will be so attractive with melodious musical sounds, and above all our good behavior and advanced Krishna Consciousness, will make this show very successful. In the meantime, you train the Kirtana party as you are doing, and the responsive method is all perfect. I have already written you in my last letter in this connection, and again I say that the responsive method should be practiced. There may be more than one singer, just like you may take the leader's seat, sometimes Jaya Govinda may take the leader's seat, sometimes others may take the leader's seat, but the method of chanting and responding, then chanting, should always be followed. When I come to New York certainly we shall devise plans on this touring program, not only traveling within the States, but also traveling all over the world. And when we go to India in course of our travel, we shall collect some Indian devotees also to join us. Not only Indian, we shall gradually collect devotees from all over the world without any discrimination. Our Krishna Consciousness movement must be all-pervading, as Krishna is all-pervading.

You will be glad to know that in San Francisco they are trying to purchase one house. I have already suggested Rayarama for a regular printing press for printing our books. And some of the Brahmacaris may be engaged in the publication work, some of them may be engaged in the Kirtana party preaching work, and some of them in distributing our literature. That will make our mission perfect.

Just today we had one meeting in the California State College at Long Beach, Cal., they issued the enclosed pamphlet which may be published in Back to Godhead. I hope you are both well and happy.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
