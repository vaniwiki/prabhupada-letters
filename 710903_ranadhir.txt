====== Letter to: Ranadhir ======

Sriman Ranadhir Das Adhikary\\
c/o New Vrindaban

My Dear Ranadhir, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 30th August, 1971 and I thank you very much for the same. Also please offer my blessings to your wife and newly welcome daughter whom I have named Radhastami Dasi.

I have read your letter with great pleasure how you are appreciating this Krishna Consciousness Movement and becoming happy more and more in executing devotional service to Lord Krishna. Now you have got Radha Krishna Deities. Please worship them very nicely. Change the dress and ornaments and flowers daily and offer nice bhoga. At night offer puris, milk and other nice preparations should be offered also. In the morning offer fruits and during the day time nice dhal, chopaties, etc. Sometimes special preparations can be offered on Sunday - Kachories, sweet balls. Keep everything very neat and clean and there should always be candle light and incense and chanting Hare Krsna 24 hours. You will find that New Vrindaban is not different from the original Vrindaban.

So you have got a nice Radhastami child. She will be ever remembered as one of the maidservants of Radharani and her life will be happy in the association of devotees.

I understand that the incense business is very lucrative there. So get money and develop New Vrindaban to its fullest extent. Also you can send me $400.00 for the Deities as soon as possible.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
