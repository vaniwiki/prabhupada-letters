My dear Jayadvaita,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10th July, 1971 and have noted the contents. Also I have received the laid-out sheets for tapes no. 1 & 2 and they are very well done. Thank you very much. I was so much pleased to see that already the tapes were edited and laid out and this is encouraging me to translate more and more. You can give Ch. 8 of S.B. canto 4 the title "Dhruva Maharaja enters the forest to meet the Lord".

One point is that I do not understand how it is that the synonyms for the last 18 chapters of the 3d canto and the first 7 chapters of 4th canto are missing? Anyway, I have begun this work and the first tape of synonyms, tape no. 6, was sent to Pradyumna today. This work will take at least one month to complete.

Very soon I am coming to N.Y. and we can discuss further on these matters.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
