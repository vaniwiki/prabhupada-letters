Laguna Beach

My dear Rsabhadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of you letter dated Dec. 7, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully. If we sincerely desire to spread Krsna Consciousness then Krsna provides all facility. So now Krsna has provided the $20,000.00 needed for the down payment for your building. That man who has given us the money, he is a very good man and he should be encouraged in every way to become more and more connected with our movement. Give him good association with Vaisnavas and nice Krsna prasadam and he will develop love for Krsna. I am very happy to hear of the large number of new devotees you are recruiting there in Laguna Beach. That is the real fruit of our preaching work, when people come and join and help us to spread this Krsna Consciousness movement. So I am very pleased with your efforts there. Upon your recommendation I have accepted the following for second initiation; Asurakulanasana dasa brahmachari, Satangati dasa brahmachari, Ratnanabha dasa Adhikari, Khandabhasi dasi, Dhatreyi dasi. Their threads are enclosed herein.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
