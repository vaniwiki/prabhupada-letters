Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Here is a Bengali letter from Sri Kamal Krsna das. The letter speaks for itself. He wants to live in our Mayapur Center. You can call him, talk to him and if he is useful give him shelter. He is very much anxious to live in our place.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
