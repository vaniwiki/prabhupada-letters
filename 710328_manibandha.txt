My Dear Manibandha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. Yes, the difficulty in these marriages is that our brahmacharies are getting themselves married with no means of support. Therefore they are not taking a separate apartment and so many other things they are neglecting also. Therefore the wife becomes dissatisfied.

So your wife has left and you are feeling that it is all Krishna's mercy. That is nice attitude. So if that is how you are feeling and you are appreciating brahmachary life, then simply forget your wife and engage yourself wholeheartedly in devotional activities and be fully Krishna Conscious. Otherwise, if you are intent on having her back, then first you must get a job so as to be able to support her. Then try to get her back. Whatever you do, that's all right, but do it in Krishna Consciousness.

The proper spelling of your name is 'Manibandha'. Manibandha means bedecked with jewels.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
