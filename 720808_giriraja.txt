My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated July 31, 1972, and I think things are going nicely there, but we must always remember that the Hare Krishna Land Development Trust, the trustees must be such persons who contribute lump sums for developing different parts of the building. I am very pleased that Mr. Kandelwal has contributed for the library portion. Similarly, I request Sumati Morarji to contribute for the temple portion. I am prepared to put a tablet that the temple portion is contributed by Sumati Morarji. Similarly, the two wings on both sides of the courtyard in front of the temple may be contributed, one by Mrs. A. B. Nair, one by somebody else. The idea is that all the trustees should contribute with great distinguishment.

And let me know how many trustees you are taking

[TEXT MISSING]

how many are our initiated members. Our initiated members must be in the majority, and if any deed has to be prepared then I shall send you the wordings. If not, verbally is all right. If they want to make any documents, that must be approved by me. The idea is that no one should enter into the management without any sanction. If they pay lump sums then they can be on the committee, but our majority must be there. We have had bad experience in Nairobi due to carelessness in forming the management committee, therefore I am advising you in this way.

You mention you are making a resolution to change the Articles and Memorandum of Association, but I do not think you can do that because the trustees in the Articles and Memorandum must all sign, and I do not think that you are mentioned there. You may send me one copy of that Articles and Memorandum. Why she wants to be included in the Articles?

On the total, how many square feet are estimated throughout the whole building? You must raise the full amount of our expenditures. Sumati Morarji is our %%___%% friend, that's all right, but tactfully she must agree to contribute for the main temple, just like Khandelwal. Let me know what they are doing.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
