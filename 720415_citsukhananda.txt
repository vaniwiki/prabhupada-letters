Mexico City

My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 3/10/72, duly forwarded to me here in New Zealand from our Bombay branch. I am very much pleased to hear that Mexico City center is developing very nicely under your expert supervision, and I also note that you say that Latin America is very much ready for Krishna Consciousness movement. So if you like I can come there after leaving Hawaii, before coming to Los Angeles, where I shall end my touring. So we are going to Honolulu from Tokyo on May 6th, 1972, and I think we shall remain about two to three weeks in Hawaii, then we can come to Mexico City direct from there, say, near end of May. Is that all right? You may correspond with my secretary, Syamasundara, in this regard, and make all arrangements with him. I think we can stay in Mexico City about one week or ten days before we must return to Los Angeles.

I am sending one of our new sannyasis, Hanuman das Goswami, to South America. He is here with me now, but he shall leave by ship very soon, so if you have got any Spanish-speaking devotees there who can assist him in preaching throughout South America, you can tell them to write him here at the above address, and they can make arrangements to meet for performing this great task of pioneer preachers on South American continent.

So far your wife is concerned, you have given her one son, so that is sufficient---now she will always have some engagement to raise the child and train him in Krishna Consciousness, so you can be free to devote yourself more fully in spreading this Krishna Consciousness movement.

Upon your recommendation, I shall accept Jan Prabhu as my duly initiated disciple, and his letter follows.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
