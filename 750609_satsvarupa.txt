My dear Satsvarupa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated May 9, June 5, June 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. So, work very nicely to encourage Abhirama and the others to very enthusiastically carry on our program there in Miami, even though there may be so many difficulties. I will be coming to Denver temple on the 27th, of June approximately, from L.A. on my way to Chicago. I can stay in Denver 6 or 7 days.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
