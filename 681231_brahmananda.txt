My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 27, 1968 and I have noted the contents carefully.

I have seen with very much pleasure the floor plan to our new temple. You have done nicely in arranging the placement of the various items in the temple. Having the guests enter through the store area is all right and will be good advertisement. Regarding Nara Narayana, he is already preparing to go there. He is very intelligent and I understand that he has very fine carpentry skills. Also, he has knowledge about casting deities, so after his business with the temple work is completed you can try to encourage him to continue with his casting work. He is coming from a respectable farm family, but sometimes I understand he becomes little eccentric, so keep him carefully. He is a hard worker and a good boy, and a devotee also. So far as portioning off part of the kitchen for prasadam taking area, the idea is very nice. But as usual, no prasadam should be taken in the kitchen where cooking goes on.

So far as your safe, I will send some papers for safe-keeping later on. I have also a safe deposit box in the bank here, and there is no charge for its use. I am wondering if there is any charge for the box at the Trade Bank. You have written that you have received the 2nd canto __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ and please keep it carefully in my room for the present time.

The new temple in Los Angeles is very nice and Sankirtana is going on there very nicely. I do not know how is your temple there, I have heard that it is very nice, but I think that the temple here is probably nicer. The rent is higher here though. Nara Narayana will give you details when he arrives. Enclosed is the duly signed documents for instating Rsi Kumar as the new secretary. He is very good boy.

Please convey my blessings to all of the nice devotees of the New York temple. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: I have just received your letter of December 28, 1968. As you have nicely suggested, I am sending one copy of __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ to Srimati Morarji, but I do not think we require to send one to Dr. Radhakrishnan. In the future it is all right if we open a letter of credit with the United Shipping Company. Regarding this order sent on December 12, 1968, please send me a price breakdown of the various items so we may see how it totals to $250. ACB\\
P.S. I have not heard anything from Gargamuni since a long time neither any check %%__%%. I am simply thinking of $7000.00 always as it is withdrawn from my savings. It must be filled up as soon as possible. ACB
