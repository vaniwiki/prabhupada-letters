Dear Sir:

Re: My S/B account No. 29/12802 with you

In continuation of my letter dated 28 February, 1970. I beg to enclose herewith the true copy of letter No. FEX.22/-277 of your Chandni Chowk, Delhi Branch. I am sure you have received Rs. 6000 (Rs. Six thousand only) transfer as stated by your Delhi Branch.

Please transfer immediately Rs. 5000 (Rs. Five thousand only) to savings account No. 8/16578 United Bank of India Ltd., 157/B Dharmatalla Street, Calcutta-13 in favor of M. M. De (Mathura Mohan De) and send me the debit note here.
