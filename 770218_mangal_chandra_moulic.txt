Dear Sri Mangal Chandra Moulic;

I have received your letter of February 15, and thank you very much. Yes we are willing to help you to make your college a Krsna Conscious institution, but you must agree to follow. We are ourselves strictly following the instructions of Caitanya Mahaprabhu which are nondifferent from the teachings of Lord Krsna in the Bhagavad-gita. Lord Caitanya taught for the benefit of all humanity, by teaching the constitutional knowledge of the self as the eternal servant of Krsna. If you come to our Mayapur center we shall be glad to talk of the proposal you are suggesting.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
