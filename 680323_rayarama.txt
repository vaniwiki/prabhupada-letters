My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 20, 1968, and I thank you for it very much. I am happy to hear you have finished Teachings of Lord Caitanya, and it is all turning out very encouraging. Brahmananda has done nicely both the Gita and TLC, now he has to make sales organization and that credit is awaiting him.

You should take BTG as your life and soul. Your work for BTG is first and foremost above all. If you do not find any time for other things, there is no objection, but I want to see that you make BTG a successful magazine like Life magazine or Illustrated Weekly of India. I am very much ambitious of the progress of the paper, and you can use your discretion how to do it. You are at liberty to do it with full power of attorney. So far discussions of political affairs in BTG, it is not a very good suggestion. But if you can present political affairs in spiritual light, as I wrote some articles in the original BTG in the matter of political divisions of India, and catastrophes thereof. That requires a very thorough understanding of the whole situation, and if you can do this, it will be a great service. I wanted therefore a combined editorial board. Unfortunately, you have to do everything yourself. For this work I think you will have to invite cooperation from others who may help you. Anyway, BTG must be improved to the fullest extent, because it is the backbone of our society. Think over it, and do it nicely as far as possible, and if necessary, you can stop any other activities. But people like your lectures also, and I hope you are delivering your nice lectures in the classes. For the time being, you stop thinking of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and we will make plan when I meet you in N.Y. It is very nice that you are preparing a book on the life of Lord Caitanya. Also, if you can get the Isopanisad printed that is very nice. Part of it is in the original BTG, and part is manuscript there. As for Brahma Samhita, I am not working on it at the present moment, but I have thought of it. But I will see to it later on.

So far BTG is concerned, if Gaurasundara is not able to help in this matter, you can take help from the other artists who have been working in cooperation with Jadurani for now. You can suggest to them and I am certain they will be able to do it.

Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
