My dear Atreya Rsi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated March 25th, 1977.

Power hungry politicians are creating havoc everywhere. These rascals create so many difficult situations. The public is very nice but the politicians keep them in ignorance. I have studied the whole world. Human nature is the same everywhere. The mass of people are very good but these rogues create by their personal aggrandizement so many difficulties.

Your report of your visit to Pakistan is very very encouraging. Why not develop this center and take the help of these men? The temple is already there and the men are willing to help. Simply we have to explain our philosophy to the learned circles. Generally our program should be to hold kirtana and give very nice sumptuous prasadam, and if the opportunity arises we can speak some philosophy. If you invite everyone, and the Hindus and Muslims come and take prasadam, that will unify the whole country.

Your entire program as you have outlined it is one hundred percent approved by me. I have got all faith that you can intelligently guide and develop this center very nicely. I also like the idea of Amoghalila going there. Just now Gopala Krishna has gone to Delhi and Vrndavana but when he returns I shall speak to him about Amogha-lila going to Karachi.

Thank you very much for opening up this encouraging field of preaching. I shall be very glad to receive a report how everything is going in Tehran.

Hoping this meets you and all of the devotees there in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
