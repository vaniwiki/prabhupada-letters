My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessing. Enclosed please find one letter from Durdaivanasana Das (Mr. Chopra ) of Gorakhpur. He has asked me to help his son, so you can call this boy as advised by Mr. Chopra in the letter and you can help him by sending him to Gorakhpur and giving him what travelling expenses are required also. (Ticket and a little cash).

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
