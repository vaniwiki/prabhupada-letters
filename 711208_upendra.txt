My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter dated November 22, 1971, and with pleasure I note that Melbourne Temple is going on very nicely under your supervision. Now keep the standard of our routine work very high, and you will always meet with all success. The best news is that you are increasing nicely the distribution of my books and literature. This is the best activity, to distribute solid information about Krishna. Our preaching stands solid on these books. No other movement or cult has such vast background of authority, so we are not afraid to challenge anyone and everyone to defeat their philosophy on the basis of that authority. Krishna appreciates such strong preachers as His dearmost servants, so let us work very enthusiastically to drive away rascal philosophy and establish the real religion of __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__

You say that you have met people who claim that by evolution we are approaching a higher stage of existence. That is true in one sense, that anyone who takes to Krishna Consciousness may elevate himself to the highest status of life. Krishna mentions many types of higher beings in __Bhagavad-gita,__ such as demigods and those who dwell on higher planets. We have information that there are 8,400,000 species of life. Out of these, 400,000 species are considered human life. Of these 400,000, how many species do we find in our experience? Not many, probably less than 1,000, so we must conclude that there are hundreds of thousands of higher and lower types of human forms. But this does not mean that automatically one body evolves into a higher body. No. It is described by Krishna how the soul becomes embodied according to his desire. So there are 8,400,000 types of bodies eternally existing. Not that the appearance of a new form in __this__ world means that form has never existed previously. No, as conditions change on this earth planet, the living entities here desire to enjoy in a different way, so they take a different type of body. Even that body may be new here, it has always existed also somewhere else. So if a man qualifies for that body, he may be rewarded the body of superman, as he desires. So if someone wants such body, he must learn the process for acquiring it, that is __Bhagavad-gita.__

Practically speaking, history tells us that human life is becoming more and more degraded in respect of good qualities. Even there may be some temporary advancement of technology, where is the question of being higher than previously? In Vedic literature we find description of all kinds of wonderful machines, like great airplanes which moved as fast as the mind on the principle of sound vibration. Where is that science now? And how is their science advancing when their sons are all becoming hippies who have no interest in such science? Compare our so-called knowledge today with the giant brains who gave us Vedic literature. No poetry, no science, no philosophy, no religion, no culture, no knowledge we have today can be said to be superior to that we find 5,000 years or more ago in India. So where is the question of advancement of civilization? We cannot create even one flower, what to speak of one sun, so we should not be hopeful that in this material atmosphere there will be any kind of improvement at all. Better to become closely associated with the Supreme Perfect, then we shall know what is perfection of our life. This is the culmination of evolution.

I have no objection if you install Jagannatha deities. For asthma, no food should be taken at night, and in general avoid overloading the stomach. Chanting Hare Krishna and drinking only caranamrta water is the best remedy for any bodily disease. But if something else required, chew a little thyme after meals. Potassium iodide is a temporary medicine for asthma. If there are broken beads, they may simply be replaced without that I have to chant on them. Once sanctified by the Spiritual Master, your chanting of Hare Krishna is eternally blessed.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
