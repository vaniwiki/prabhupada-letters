My dear Satsvarupa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 19, 1976 as well as your copies of two purchase orders from two universities for the Bhagavad-gita As It Is.

The public libraries can order many sets, 50 to 100 at a time, for all their branches. Your tactics sound very good. The Indian professors reviews can be used to stimulate American orders, and the American professors' reviews can be used to stimulate orders in India. So now with so many testimonials, why these libraries will not purchase?

The scientists cannot make a machine from a seed. Why not? Can they make a typewriter machine tree, or an automobile tree, that you plant a seed and you get an automobile . . . it gets bigger, bigger, bigger until it is a full size automobile. They cannot make even one egg, and they are going to manufacture life? And we have to believe it? They are lunatics, this is demoniac. They want to compete with God.

Concerning the Deities in Chicago temple, if you want to have large size Gaura-Nitai then I have no objection. Your new travelling mobile temple sounds very nice. I shall be glad to see it when I visit Detroit. Keep yourself comfortable so that you can work nicely. There is no need of dry vairagya.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
