My dear Lalita Kumar,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter along with Subala's. I am very glad to know that you are going to be married with Srimati Jambavatidevi dasi, and I bless you---be happy with your good wife and jointly be advanced in Krishna Consciousness.

Yes, opening a center in Florida is our long contemplation, and I remember the letter when you and Sridhama wrote me about this. Where is Sridhama now? I am very much anxious to know about his health. If he is there, please ask him to write me. Now, if it is possible to open a center in Florida, then you can think of it because now you will have the support of your good wife. But I think for a few days more you should take training in Philadelphia before you think of opening another center. That will be nice.

My open advice is that if any one can remain a Brahmacari, it is very nice, but there is no need of artificial Brahmacaris. In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that one who exhibits outwardly as self restrained, but inwardly he thinks of sense gratification he is condemned as __mithyacara__ which means false pretender. We do not want any false pretenders in numbers, but we want a single sincere soul. There is no harm in accepting a wife and living without any disturbance of the mind and thus sincerely advancing in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
