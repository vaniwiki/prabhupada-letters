My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 17th April, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I have received one letter from Dai Nippon. They want immediately $30,000.00 more. Formerly the total amount to be paid for BTG was $52,000.00, and they were not willing to publish any more. Therefore from my book fund I paid them immediately $20,000. Now there is an additional $30,000.00 because another two issues of BTG were printed. So if you can send them another $10,000. immediately, they will be satisfied for the time being. I do not know exactly what the account is, but they are hesitating. They should be satisfied as much as possible. Their dealing and craftsmanship has always been very good so we must keep good relationship with them. Whatever BTG collection made should be quickly sent to Dai Nippon so that they will be pacified.

Recently I have received one letter from Hayagriva in which he wanted to know in 24 hours whether I could pay $20,000, but I have already given $20,000 to BTG. Besides that, New Vrindaban has to be developed very nicely but whether Hayagriva has already transferred the property to the society's name? This is required now. We require seven temples in New Vrindaban and 50% of the membership collection (Building fund) may be invested for this purpose. But Hayagriva should transfer the property to the society's name.

Our incense trademark should be registered now. I understand that there is one man in Bombay who has plagiarized our Spiritual Sky label, so we are serving him the proper notice to stop this plagiarizing business. So income is increasing there. That is very good. But in the winter season the collections are not so good so you should make some compensation for those months. The point is that there must not be any financial difficulty. If there is not sufficient engagement in the temple, the devotees should work outside, although if we can manage without our men working outside that is best.

So far as the Indians in San Francisco, they should be tackled nicely. They have promised, so someone should collect that proposed $20,000. Yes, Tejiyas and Laura can be married. His name is Tejiyas, not Tejios. I was confused by the mispelling.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
