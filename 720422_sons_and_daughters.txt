My dear sons and daughters,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter, undated, along with your offering of $100, and I thank you very much. You are all very nice, sincere boys and girls, and Krishna has been very kind to send you all to help me in this great task of trying to save all the fallen souls from such a dangerous position. At every step there is danger, but under the strong grip of maya, we forget this. So the task is very great to give real knowledge, Krishna consciousness, to everyone, and I am so much encouraged by your determined efforts. Please increase more and more, and Krishna will help you.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
