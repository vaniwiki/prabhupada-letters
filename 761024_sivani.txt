My dear Sivani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 11, 1976.

I am forwarding your letter to Jayapataka Maharaja in Mayapur. He will contact you whether it is alright for you to come there to work for Krsna as you have requested. Please take this Krsna consciousness very seriously and make your life perfect.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
