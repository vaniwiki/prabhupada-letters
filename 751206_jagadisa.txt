My dear Jagadisa Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Dec. 1, 1975, I have noted the contents very carefully. I said from the very beginning that we should not move, but you proposed moving, so now you are proposing staying at Dallas. So it is all right, stay at Dallas and develop there.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
