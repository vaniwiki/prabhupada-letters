My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I have just received one letter from Dr. O.B.L. Kapoor of Vrindaban and would like to know if you have sent that letter to him regarding the book publishing. You can add to that letter that Dr. Svarupa Damodara M.S. PhD. U.S.A. has written recently one book __Scientific Basis of Krsna Consciousness__ and there was no contract or agreement. He has given us the book, and we have printed 30,000 copies. We shall not publish on the basis of royalty.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
