My dear Dinesh,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated April 20, 1969, and the tape of our Sankirtana recording and prayer. Everyone who has heard it here is very satisfied with the result, and I thank you very much for your efforts in this connection. I am enclosing herewith one letter from Brahmananda, and you can understand from this how much this recording is being appreciated.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
