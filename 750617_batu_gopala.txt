====== Letter to: Batu Gopala ======

Cleveland

My dear Batu Gopala,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 8th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I accept the persons you have recommended for initiation (first). Their names are as follows, Bill---Bhama dasa, Brenda---Brahma-vadini devi dasi, Michael---Mahana dasa. Their beads may be chanted by Kirtanananda Swami. Also, I have accepted Divyanga dasa for 2nd initiation. His thread and mantra sheet are enclosed herein. Let him hear the tape of myself chanting gayatri mantra through his right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
