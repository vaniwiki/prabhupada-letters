Hyderabad

My dear Mahamsa Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one letter from Sudharu deva dasa whom you have transferred to Madras. He like to stay in Hyderabad to be engaged in the service of the deity, so what was the difficulty to keep him there? He is interested in worshiping Radha-Modanmohan deity and very very anxious to stay at Hyderabad. If there is not great difficulty, I think he may be called back.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
