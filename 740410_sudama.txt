Dear Sudama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 5, 1974 and I have carefully noted the contents. It is very reassuring to me to hear you are conscientiously engaged in carrying out the orders of your spiritual master in the specific assignment given to you in Hawaii.

I fully approve of the decisions made by you as follows.

1) Your decision to peacefully and legally take over possession of the forty acres of land. So proceed as quickly as possible with the lawyer so that the land is legally ISKCON's with yourself as trustee, and then we can take it and use it for Krsna.

2) Yes, you must get the payments being made on the sale of the land donated to ISKCON by Siddhasvarupa transferred to our account and not to Gaurasundara.

Gaurasundara has tried to make complete havoc of our affairs there but because I have faithful sons like yourself I think we shall be able to recover what he has tried to ruin. I am also glad you are consulting with BaliMardan in these affairs.

The main thing is to go on with our regular program, distributing books, chanting Hare Krsna, holding festivals, hearing the philosophy, and then as you are reporting, more devotees will come. So I think it is going very successfully under your Krsna Conscious management. Please keep me informed as things progress.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I wish to go to Honolulu again.\\
