Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. In response to your telephonic message, I beg to enclose herewith one check, #PHF 431993 for Rs 24,000.00 (Rupees twenty four thousand only) account paid in favor of Rajastani Moorti Kala Kendra, Jaipur, duly signed by me. Please acknowledge receipt and as far as I see the balance is now Rs 5,293.00 (Rupees five thousand, two hundred and ninety three only). Therefore let me know what is the further addition and also take another check book for which the requisition slip is also duly signed by me. Find it herewith and send me the checkbook duly stamped, by registered post.

I am also sending this letter by registered post with enclosed check, and a copy by regular post. Do the needful.

Also, I left my gold shirt buttons in Vrindaban, in the locked closet, to which Gurudasa has the key. Tamala Krsna Maharaja says Dhrstadyumna has been given charge to see that someone coming from Vrindaban to Bombay brings the gold buttons. Please see that this is being done.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
