====== Letter to: Candanacarya, Kasturika ======

San Francisco

My dear Candanacarya and Kasturika,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram dated May 15, 1973. Thank you very much.

Now I am in Dallas and the climate here is very suitable with plenty of good sunshine. I shall remain here for a few days and if my health improves there will be no need for my going back to India.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
