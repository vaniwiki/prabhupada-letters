My dear Satsvarupa dasa Gosvami;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 2, 1974 together with enclosures. Your letter is very much pleasing to me with the report of the book distribution. Whenever I get report of my book selling I feel strength. Even now in this weakened condition I have got strength from your report. You should know that in this work you have Krishna's blessings. You are a sincere worker. Right from the very beginning when you joined me you have always been a sincere worker, therefore, I keep you as GBC. You may not be a good manager, but whatever I say you accept. These are all good qualifications. Others should follow your example and take instruction from you to push on this library program. I have instructed Tamala Krishna Goswami that he can also so this library program.

The American people are very intelligent, therefore I concentrate on the Americans for spreading this movement. They are not crippled by poverty like here in India. In India of course the people are naturally Krishna conscious. Whenever we have some Krishna conscious program they come by the thousands, but they are crippled by poverty. Therefore it is difficult for them to take to this movement seriously. So you go on with your work there in America and distribute my books to these libraries. This is very encouraging to me, to write more books.

I hope etc.\\
ACBS
