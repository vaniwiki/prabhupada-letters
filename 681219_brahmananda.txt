My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 15, and December 17, 1968. I have carefully noted the contents of both of these.

You have requested my suggestion for the neon signboard outside of our new temple and I think that the bigger sign may say "International Society for Krishna Consciousness" and the other may say the Hare Krishna Mantra if it is not too much expensive.

Regarding the listing of the Bhagavad-gita in the religion catalog of MacMillan, they have spelled it Bhaga__vid__ Gita and not __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ I do not know why they should commit such mistake, I hope that this will not hamper the sales. Please point out this discrepancy to Mr. Wade. The list of names you received from MacMillan of reviewer copies should be kept carefully so you may approach them with copies of __Teachings Of Lord Caitanya.__ Try to convince these reviewers that these literatures are very badly needed at the present time when people are becoming confused on account of godlessness. Our Krishna Consciousness movement is a re-orientation movement for reviving the dormant Krishna Consciousness so these reviewers should cooperate and help our movement as far as possible.

I have seen the __Teachings of Lord Caitanya__ documents and as requested by you I am returning them for your files. I am also sending back the voucher of the bank duly signed by me for debiting my account for the charges. But one thing I must inform you is that out of my account almost $7,000 has been withdrawn in so many ways. Now this should be filled up as soon as possible because a bank balance in my favor is required in this country. Due to this bank balance I got my permanent visa and also due to this bank balance we have got the nicest temple in Los Angeles. So in case of a need I may require to show this bank balance under different circumstances and especially because I am a foreigner. Therefore the bank balance's blank or vacancy already created by drawing out about $7,000 must be filled up by selling books as far as possible. My only suggestion for this selling is to get the books widely reviewed in different papers and that is the only standard method of promoting this publication. By such reviews as soon as there is some demand all the book sellers will purchase from the publisher at least three copies each. That is the way of propagating sales organization.

Regarding my apartment, if it is possible to keep it with no strain on your financial condition it is alright. Otherwise I am not very serious about retaining the apartment. Everything should be performed with no strain because too much financial strain will hamper our progress in Krishna Consciousness.

Purusottama is helping me since he has come and I think that he should remain with me always. I require a male secretary because there are so many letters coming daily and which require expert management. At the same time he will be securing advertisements for __Back To Godhead__ so I hope that you will not feel very much inconvenience because he is not there in New York. Regarding my health, I am glad to inform you that it is in better condition than that last year when I returned from India. I am feeling no more headaches nor any severe buzzing sound---but still some buzzing is going on. After all it is a broken house and I cannot expect all the comforts of a newly built house in an old broken residence.

I thank you once more for your noble sentiments about me and I can simply say that for this nice attitude Krishna will certainly help you. I am fully aware of your sincere service and therefore I pray always to Krishna for your all-round welfare. You have got a nice temple by the grace of my Spiritual Master. It is very encouraging to me. You should always pray to His Divine Grace because naturally He will be more affectionate to you than to me. Generally one is more affectionate to the grandchildren than to the children directly. So I am sure that my Guru Maharaja will be easily inclined to your prayers than that of mine. You will do good always by offering your prayers to His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhanta Goswami Maharaja.

Please convey my blessings to all of the devotees in New York and I hope that you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: So far as you performing the marriage ceremony in exchange for a nice rug, the idea is alright and if you request I will send you instructions.\\
