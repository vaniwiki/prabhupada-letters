My dear Atreya Rsi Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 25, 1973 and have read the contents carefully. Regarding purchasing the Washington D.C. Temple, yes, we can do it. We can invest $70,000.00, and Damodara can pay $700 per month net rent. So you negotiate, and we shall purchase in name of M-V Trust. But, here in L.A. we have invested $63,000 in one house and we are getting $800 per month rent. So you consult with Karandhara and do the needful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. What happened about the Columbia club house?
