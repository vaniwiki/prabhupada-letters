My dear Jagadisa dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter November 2, 1974 and have noted the contents. I have also received the enclosed clipping from Ottawa and the information about the property. This property must be considered by the GBC. If it can be properly utilized, it is nice, for Varna-asrama College and dairy farm. With 100 acres for cultivation you can make much production. The land is attractive. If it can be utilized by the opinion of the GBC, then it is good. I think it should be utilized. For which center will it be purchased?

Regarding Gurukula, they are in financial difficulty, so introduce book distribution. Sankirtana and Book Distribution should be pushed side by side, and there will be no difficulties. That is our experience.

If men are available, yes, you can open a center in Kansas City,; that will be nice. Regarding moving the older boys to New Orleans, that is to be decided by the GBC.

Regarding the lollipops, there is nothing wrong. It is something attractive I can understand, an introduction of friendship. What is the wrong? It is sugar, so it can be offered to the Deity. Just like here we can offer sweets purchased from the market place. It is stated in the sastras that if you pay something for it, it is purified even if there is some fault in it.

Regarding Chicago that you paid off Dollars 35,000.00 is wonderful. You are a good manager. As GBC please see that the temples are maintaining the standards, and I will be very much thankful.

The article is nice, the "elevator" is this Krishna consciousness movement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
