My dear Bhagavan Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 6.9.73 and have noted the contents. It is all very much encouraging to me. You have got a good temple and good number of devotees, so now you just utilize them in Krsna's service, and I will be very much pleased.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
