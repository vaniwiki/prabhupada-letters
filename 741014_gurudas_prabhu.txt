Dear Gurudas Prabhu:

Please accept my humble obeisances. Your letter to Srila Prabhupad dated October 3, 1974 in transit has been received. Srila Prabhupad affirms that he never gave you permission to leave India, but only to leave Vrindaban. You left without informing me of you intentions. Now you are asking for him to write a letter so you can collect money. But what about the monies you have already received? Where is the account? So far I know you have received from Murtidas Dollars 4,000.00; from Nanda Kumar 1700.00; from Srila Prabhupad before he left India Rs. 60,000/-, and from Karandhar Rs. 40,000/-. You must present the account of how these monies were spent before getting any facility for collecting additional funds. As GBC I must request you not to try to collect any money until you account for this money.

What is the need of your going outside of India to collect? Ample money is already coming without your having to go, and Srila Prabhupad has taken responsibility for providing funds whatever you need himself. He wanted you to stay in Vrindaban and manage there. Why have you left?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your servant

Brahmananda Swami
