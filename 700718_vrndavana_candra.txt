My dear Vrndavana Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter informing me that you have lost your original set of beads and requesting me to chant upon the new set sent also enclosed by you. You are intelligent boy and now you are in very responsible position as president of our Baltimore branch, so you should be more careful. Anyway, I have chanted duly the beads and they are herewith returned to you.

I hope that you and your good wife are doing well in Baltimore. I have very favorable reports from our East coast centers. Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
