My dear Rupanuga das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated August 29 and September 7, 1975 with enclosures. The matter regarding by-laws and the articles of incorporation should be definitely brought up at our annual Mayapur meeting. One thing: why is that so few temples are sending the affidavits? You should see that this is done. This is the important thing. No one should go against this principle. We have discussed this matter thoroughly. Please see that it is done.

Regarding Washington, D.C. temple, it is the capital of your country. Therefore, the building there must be suitable. Do things very nicely there. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
