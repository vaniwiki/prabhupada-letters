My dear Ramesvara Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of one letter from Srivatsa Goswami, 45 Dumrao Bagh Colony, Assi, Varanasi 221 005, India. He has written that Santosa das met him at his residence in Vrindaban and proposed to give Srivatsa Goswami all of my books in exchange for a set of "Goswami literature" edited by Sri Puridasa; all this was done without my sanction. Why has Santosa asked him for this? No one told him to do so. Write to him and ask him who gave him permission to do this!

What is this swop??? Why haven't they asked me first??? We have nothing to do with any publication by these people. Those books should be returned at once. Do the needful. Already they have sent several of my books to Srivatsa Goswami and Srivatsa Goswami mentions that he received 2 volumes of Caitanya Caritamrta from Los Angeles BBT Warehouse. Who is doing this?

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
