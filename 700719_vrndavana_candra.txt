Baltimore

My dear Vrndavana Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12th July, 1970, and noted the contents.

I am very glad that Haladhara has gone to join you in Baltimore center. Now you are three men strong so carry on our program nicely and gradually more sincere souls will come. Do not be disappointed but be always engaged in pushing on Sankirtana, distribution of our literatures, Prasadam, and preaching and classes and sincere souls will come. It is only required that we work very sincerely and Krsna will provide all facilities according to our endeavor.

Regarding your first question: When a person becomes a perfect yogi he can transfer himself to any planet in the material or spiritual sky at his will. That is the perfection of the mystic yoga process. Generally the yogis are impersonalists, therefore they transfer to higher planets within this material world. This is explained in the Second Canto of Bhagavatam. In Chapter VIII, verse XIII of the Gita it is described that the yogi is thinking of the Lord while vibrating Om, so he goes to the Lord's Abode because he is thinking of Krsna.

One who knows what is Om knows that Om is the sound representation of Krsna he immediately remembers Krsna just like we chant __Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.__ This conception of Om and impersonal conception is different. The impersonalist has no information of Krsna, he thinks of something like the Brahmajyoti effulgence.

Yes Krsna fulfills everyone's desires fully. He can full our desires either materially or spiritually. Material desires to be the supreme enjoyer or god are not natural desires, however. Such desire is maya. Maya means what is not. Our constitutional position is not that of the supreme enjoyer so such desire is unnatural and false. Krsna fulfills the ultimate spiritual desire of everyone also. According to one's constitutional position he enjoys a fully perfect relationship of love with Krsna.

Just like a hand is not happy when it is trying to be independent and it becomes naturally happy when it acts in its constitutional capacity as subordinate part and parcel of the whole body. But if the hand desires to be the complete body that desire is not constitutional so such fulfillment of false desire cannot be real. However for those who are not advanced in their intelligence and desire to be one with the Supreme, Krsna grants such persons the opportunity to merge their identity in his transcendental effulgent body. So that desire can be fulfilled by Krsna also, but one who is in full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who knows his own constitutional position never desires in that way. Rather he always desires only to fulfill his constitutional position of eternal existence as servant of Krsna and such service is complete and perfect and the supreme pleasure for the living entity. Who can enjoy more than one who is always enjoying Krsna? So it may be said that his enjoyment is supreme.

Regarding your third question: This yoga process is authorized, but Arjuna says that it is too difficult. The so-called yogis are simply making farce. They do not reach to the perfectional point of yoga. Arjuna admitted this difficulty and it is explained in the Bhagavad-gita. Therefore Krsna said that anyone who is thinking of Him within his heart is first class yogi.

In the Bhagavad-gita it is recommended about __kirtana.__ This __kirtana__ means __kirtana__ or glorifying of the Holy name, fame form, activities, qualities, etc. of the Lord. They are all __kirtana.__ Not that everything has to be included in the Bhagavad-gita, Therefore the spiritual Master is required. Caitanya Mahaprabhu recommends __kirtaniya sada hari__ one has to chant the glories of the Lord always.

Question fourth: What Lord Jesus Christ says, that is the destination of his devotees. What Lord Jesus Christ says I do not know. If there is no description of the Kingdom of God, then we give that---__cintamani prakara sadamasu__ . . . etc.

Question the fifth: If Mohammed as the servant of God and Lord Jesus Christ is the son of God, then where is the break of the disciplic succession. After all the disciplic succession is beginning from God, so how do you find that there is no disciplic succession? If the original tree has branches, twigs and leaves and they are in touch with the original tree, it is alright. The test is whether the line is in touch with the Supreme---that is all.

Although Mohammed and Jesus Christ appeared in the Kali Yuga their instruction is as it is because the persons to whom they had to speak could not understand any more and they find it difficult to understand even that much.

Question the sixth: You are always with Krsna. But you forget. That is maya.

Regarding Bhagavad-gita Chapter XIII, verses 5-6: All these are elements and their interactions are the bodily combination and its changes. Convictions are mental impressions derived through the body. Convictions are not fixed up. The aggregate refers to the aggregate of the elements or the body.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
