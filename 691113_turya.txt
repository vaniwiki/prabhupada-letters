====== Letter to: Turya ======

My dear Turya dasa,

Please accept my blessings. It is very kind of you to send your letter dated November 5, 1969, and I am so glad to learn that you are progressing in Krishna Consciousness. The secret of success in this line is to render service. With our present senses, materially covered, it is very difficult to understand Krishna, His transcendental Name, Fame, Form, Pastimes, etc. But if we begin rendering service unto Krishna, then being pleased with our service He will reveal Himself from within. So the more we shall try to serve Krishna the more we will be nearer to Him. All of you there are a good combination, so work conjointly in pushing on this movement. You will be happy, the people in general will be happy, and Krishna will also be very happy and thereby bestow His best blessings upon you.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
