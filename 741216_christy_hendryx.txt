My dear Christy Hendryx,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter date Dec. 3, 1974.

Thank you for the information about your land in Oregon. I think the best procedure is for you to contact either our temple president in Seattle, Washington whose name is Sukadeva dasa or you can write a letter to our headquarters in Los Angeles to Jayatirtha dasa and they will be able to make the proper decision and let you know about this land offer.

Thank you again. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
