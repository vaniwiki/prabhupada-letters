My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters, one to the GBC and Prabhus and one to me, dated 30th December, 1970.

I am so pleased that you are thinking of distributing my books to the largest extent. Distribution of books means propagation of our mission. If we can distribute KRSNA book in thousands upon thousands, automatically the Krsna Consciousness Movement will be spread up. You have rightly drawn the attention of the GBC on this point. Anyway, I have immediately sent one telegram to London reading as follows: "SHIP ONE THOUSAND KRSNA IMMEDIATELY SINGAPORE DOCUMENTS TO BALI-MARDANA---SYAMASUNDARA". So you also remind Mukunda and Murari for shipping the books as early as possible. Immediately I want $17,000 for printing Bhagavad-gita As It Is in new enlarged and revised edition, so try to help in this connection.

Regarding two brahmacaris, surely I shall send you two from India. This morning I have come to Calcutta and the address is as follows: ISKCON Calcutta; 11B Jatindra Mohan Avenue; Calcutta-6. From Calcutta I shall be going to Allahabad by the end of the second week of January and the address there is as follows: c/o Prabhu Dutt Brahmachary; Sankirtan Bhavan; Jhusi, Allahabad; India. May Krsna bless you for your growing enterprise to broadcast this Movement. This kind of transcendental enthusiasm is the basic impetus for Krsna Consciousness. My Guru Maharaja used to say, "One who has got life---he can preach."

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
