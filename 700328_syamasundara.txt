My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. Since a few weeks I have not received any letter from you and I understand also that some of you have moved to George's place. I shall be glad to know what is the program there.

It was also informed to me by Umapati that all of you along with George were in Paris for some television engagement. Did you find any suitable place for our Temple in Paris?

I am therefore very much anxious to hear from you and I shall be glad therefore if you reply in detail by return post.

I learn also that Murari and his wife have also gone to London, but he is staying with you. How are Malati and your nice daughter, Sarasvati? Please offer my blessings to George.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
