My dear Govinda dasi:

Please accept my blessings and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 24th February 1973.

Gaura Nitai Deities may be approved and ordered by the local Temple presidents with consultation of the GBC. There should be at least three or four brahmanas available. So there is no need to delay any shipments if these qualifications are met.

I have seen the little booklet of the lecture by your good husband, but I have not been able to read it yet, but especially I like the comparison between nirvisesavad and savisesavad, the difference is shocking.

I hope this meets you in good health and spirits.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
