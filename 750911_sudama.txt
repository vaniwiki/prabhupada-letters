My dear Sudama Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 20, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am glad that you are doing nicely in Krishna consciousness, and that you are reading my books and preaching. Tamala Krishna Goswami also gave me a good report of your activities. So now continue.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
