My dear Tripurari dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter post dated October 11, 1974 and have noted the contents. This book selling is the real preaching of our cult. Especially when you sell Caitanya Caritamrta and Srimad-Bhagavatam. They will understand what we mean by reading these books.

So you organize freely. You are the incarnation of book distribution. So take the leadership and do the needful.

Your bus program is a very nice idea, and I pray that by Krsna's grace you will have all success. Yes, you are correct that by distributing books, that income will be sufficient for all programs.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
