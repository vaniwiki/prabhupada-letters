My dear Nandarani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter Oct 2 & I am so glad to have it. You and your husband's service in respect of opening the L.A. center will be recorded in the history of our Krishna Consciousness movement. Most probably I shall be in your country by the end of October or early in Nov. I am thinking of going by pacific route so when I am in your country I shall either be first in San Francisco or L. A. My mind is always with you. Practically your country is my home now. India is foreign country for me. The reason is that my spiritual family is there & my material relationships are in India; therefore factually where my spiritual family exists, there is my home.

Regarding your personal question in the matter of relationship with your husband. Your relationship with your husband is all right. You must be faithful & devoted to your husband, Dayananda. Vedic system advises women to become very chaste & accept the husband as master. Your husband is especially good because he is progressing in Krishna Consciousness. I am very glad that you two are very good combination & your devotion for your husband & your husband's love for you are considered great achievements so I have also advised Krishna Devi for her husband, Subala. I feel very happy when I see my spiritual boys and girls especially those who have been married by my personal presence are very happy in their conjugal relationship. Even if there is some misunderstanding between husband & wife that should be completely neglected & you should always remain rigid in service of Krishna as you have written to say, it is pleasing to be in the service of Krishna. Discharge of Krishna Consciousness is our primary objective & all other relationships should be faithful to this principle. Follow this principle.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
