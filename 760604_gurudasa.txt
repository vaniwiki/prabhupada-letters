My dear Gurudasa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 28, 1976, and I have noted the contents carefully.

Try to convince them that without God Consciousness, no plan will be successful. Of course, the demoniac class of men will always remain, but unless there is a strong body to present God Consciousness proposals to the leaders of the world, there will be no hope. We have taken Bhagavad-gita as the standard of all human activities. If the leaders of the human society take it as standard, then all the problems will be solved. That we can give practical suggestions for. Any plan of the atheists will never be successful.

Your plan to go to Vrindaban in January is very nice. I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
