My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I hope that Mayapur festival preparations are going on and I am awaiting news from you. Just now Tamala has received one telegram from you reading:

"Plans underway Mayapur pandal Absolutely imperative Giriraja return immediately Calcutta for collecting."

In Madras Giriraja reports that there is good field. He is expecting to make at least one life member daily and distribute many books to bookstores. Two men have already joined him from Delhi. So as long as there is good field he should remain there. Thereafter he may return to Calcutta.

Here in Bombay there is a big program planned for the 10th January for which they are selling tickets for admission, and again on the 22nd January the premier showing of the movie "Hare Rama Hare Krishna" has been donated to us. So both are good opportunities to raise funds. In between these two functions I am most likely going to Jaipur for a seven day pandal program.

So I shall be pleased to hear from you how things are progressing with Mayapur program.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
