My dear Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28 April, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. You say that there is great prospect for moving our Krishna Conscious propaganda and activities in Germany. We are already experiencing in several cities in the USA that by performing Sankirtana on the streets, they are collecting $40-$50 minimum daily. Sometimes they are going to $150, so now you are three, so one mrdanga and two karatalas will be nice beginning for your German Sankirtana Party. I think if you go and chant in the park, you can sufficiently collect for meeting your expenditures, and the balance money you can engage for producing __Back To Godhead__ and other German literature. Actually, if you can pull on with the center without having to work outside, it is the best. If it is not possible, then the question of working outside arises. But if you can profitably start a jewelry shop and earn something, that is also very nice and will help give us income.

You will be glad to learn that your sister, Saradia, was married last night with Vaikunthanatha, and they appear to be very nice, happy couple. When I was in Montreal, your sister proposed personally that she wanted to marry Vaikunthanatha one year ago. So according to her desire she is now married.

Regarding your question about keeping daily income and expenditure records, I am enclosing a brief lesson in how to do this. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

There are two things in accounting; one thing is I am receiving some amount, and the other thing is I am paying some amount. The paying or receiving will come under certain account. Whatever I receive is put under debtor column. Debtor means receiver, and the particular begins with the word "to." Whatever I am paying is entered into the creditor column. Creditor means payer. In this way, after the whole day's transactions, you make a total of the debtor column and creditor column, and if there is any balance, it is adjusted by the words "balance carried forward." This balance is entered in the creditor column. So we have to see that the amount in the debtor column and the amount in the creditor column is equal. This is called a correct account. Next day you begin with "To Balance B.F." That means whatever balance you had the day before you put in the debtor column with particulars To Balance B.F.. Then begin your transactions as in the previous day. This is the system of keeping an account in general. For the time being, keep your account in that way, and later on, as you inquire, I will let you know more about how to keep books.
