Dear Radha Kanta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 1974 hand delivered. You should understand that when you sat at the fire sacrifice upon your initiation, you made a vow to the Spiritual Master at that time. So, you should not break these vows. You say that you appreciate the association of devotees but how will you withstand the material attraction? If you are not chanting Hare Krishna offenselessly and regularly? Affection for the spiritual master and following the instructions of the Spiritual Master is the same. My instruction is that all of my disciples must attend the mangala arati and chant 16 rounds daily.

This life is very flickering. At any moment you may die so we must cling very close to the instruction of higher authorities, the spiritual master and Lord Krishna in Bhagavad-gita. So I think that you can follow the instructions. You are intelligent hard working boy. In the meantime until you get stronger, you should remain in the association of devotees. In this way you will get a taste for spiritual life. In Bhagavad gita it is stated: __mac-citta mad-gata-prana/ bodhayantah parasparam/ kathayantas ca mam nityam/ tusyanti ca ramanti ca__ [[books:bg:10:9|(Bg. 10.9)]].

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
