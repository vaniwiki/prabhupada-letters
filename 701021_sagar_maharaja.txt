Calcutta

My dear Sagar Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I hope you are doing well along with Hansadutta and shall be glad to hear from you the reports of your activities. I shall be glad to know also if you want to stick in Calcutta only or if required you may come to Bombay. We are very much serious to open a branch in Bombay very soon.

Hope this will meet you in good health. Awaiting your early reply.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
