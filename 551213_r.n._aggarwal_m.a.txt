Dear Sri,

Re: your secretary's letter No. D.O. 807/P.T. the League of Devotees: D/22/11/55

With reference to the above and my subsequent interview with you, I beg to inform you that it has been now decided to hold a preliminary meeting of the above league in the city first to discuss the aims & objects.

Myself, Lala, Girdhari lal and, Advocate Bipinchandra Misra, three will be convenors.

I request you to preside over this meeting and give me some time at your convenience so that the meeting can be arranged accordingly.

In this meeting all the members of your committee as well as other respectable residents of old Delhi will be invited to give it an initiation.
