My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife and all the other Prabhus there. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13rd January, 1971, along with one set of beads for chanting and recommendation for the initiation of Debbie. I have duly chanted her beads and given her the spiritual name Devi Dasi. I have sent her a letter along with her beads separately. I think you will receive them soon. I beg to thank you for the initiation gift of a fifty dollar check for my book fund. It is very welcome. Some kind of gift to the Spiritual Master from the new disciple on the occasion of initiation is required that the function be complete.

I am expecting to return to the States by the end of March, so I will be very happy to see you all at that time. I think that from now on initiations may be held until I return to the States. That will be nice. Then there will be better opportunity to execute this business.

Regarding your disease, if you have been given medicine by the Doctor, you may take it. The best news is that the college students are so much receptive to our message of Krsna consciousness. Try your best to present the matter to them in such a nice way as we have already established and they are sure to recover their rightful position as devotees of the Lord.

Hope this will meet you in better health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
