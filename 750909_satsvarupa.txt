My dear Satsvarupa Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I have been informed by Brahmananda Maharaja that only six temples have sent copies of the Affidavit that I have requested from each temple. Please see why they are not sending.

From St. Louis I have received not only the Affidavit but also a "Quit Claim Deed." This decree very nicely expresses very clearly that the property cannot be sold without written permission by myself or the GBC. Such a declaration should be from all centers. Please see to this.

Also I want that all centers follow the following procedure for handling the money. Whatever income is there, every cent must be given to the treasurer. Immediately he records it in the book. Then daily he deposits everything in the bank. For the expenditures, he withdraws from the bank the petty cash by check signed by himself and the President. Then the expenditures are checked by the President to see how the money is being spent. The important thing is that all monies must be given to the treasurer and he records it and every day deposits everything in the bank. And whatever is spent that also is withdrawn from the bank. This will stop the embezzling that is going on. Please arrange for this and inform me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
