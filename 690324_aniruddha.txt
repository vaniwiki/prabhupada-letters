My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of March 19, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, I shall be arriving there in S.F. on the 31st of this month and I shall be happy to see you all there at that time. I have noted carefully the situation with Girish, and we shall best discuss the whole matter when I shall arrive there next week and make program. I am happy to learn that Dindayal and Makhanlal are doing well at Berkeley also.

Mahapurusa Brahmacari is prepared to go with me on the 31st instant, if you can send his passage fare of $75, and he will do the cooking and upkeep of my apartment while I am in San Francisco. So you can find his enclosed note to you in this connection.

I shall be happy to greet you on Monday next, and we shall discuss all things further; in the meantime, I hope you are feeling well and happy there,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
