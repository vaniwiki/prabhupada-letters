My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 16th June, 1970, along with two copies of __Nectar of Devotion.__

Yes, it is made very excellent. At least I can safely say that there is 80% perfection. This means we can hope very soon books printed from your press will be cent per cent successful as we are expecting to get from Dai Nippon. In some of the pages, the ink impression is not sufficient, otherwise it appears everything very nice. The paper is first class, the sewing is also nice, and I hope the cover binding will be nice when it is done professionally. The pictures have also come out very excellent. So everything is very hopeful. You are trying your best, and Krsna will give you proper intelligence to execute these press responsibilities.

All of you in the press are doing so hard work. I can simply pray to Krsna for your perfect advancement in Krsna consciousness. One thing I must inform you in this connection that so far our activities in Krsna Consciousness are concerned, everyone of us should read this book very attentively because all conclusive statements in the Kingdom of Bhakti are contained in this transcendental valuable book. It is the essence of all Vedic scriptures enlightening about Krsna Consciousness. If anyone will read this Nectar of Devotion very carefully, he will have all guidance in Bhakti cult. So in the temple class some portions of this book must be regularly discussed.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
