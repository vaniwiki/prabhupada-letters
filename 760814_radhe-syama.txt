====== Letter to: Radhe-Syama ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Radhe-Syama das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5th August 1976, and have noted the contents with care.

I thank you very much for your many gifts to me and your concern for my well being. This is the correct attitude for a disciple. The disciple should be prepared to offer everything he has including his body, mind, and words, in the service of the guru. Anyone who is sincerely serving to his greatest capacity becomes dear in the eyes of the Lord. So continue in your efforts to spread Krsna consciousness and to help Jayatirtha prabhu win this case, and always follow the regulative principles of devotional service without fail.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
