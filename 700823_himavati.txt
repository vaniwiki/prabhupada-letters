My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I have already acknowledged your letter dated August 13rd, 1970, along with my last reply. I am very glad to learn that you will be walking very soon, but walking or no walking you are always engaged in Krsna's service. That is my confidence.

I am very glad that Hansadutta has gone to New Vrndavana and I have requested everyone of the Governing Board Commission members to formulate a solid program for advancing Krsna Consciousness Movement all over the world.

I am feeling well here, better than Los Angeles and on the 29th August we are starting for Calcutta. The address is as follows:

37/1 Hindustan Road

Ballylganj

Calcutta-29

Certainly I shall call you for the World Sankirtana Party as soon as you are quite fit to walk. I hope that Tamala Krsna will correspond with you and your husband in this connection.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have heard the tape %%____%% %%_____%% This is full of transcendental feelings. Thanks.\\
