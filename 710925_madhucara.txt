My dear Madhucara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14th September, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so much pleased to hear how you are so enthusiastic for distributing our books and literatures. Krishna will surely bless you. This book distribution program is our real propaganda work and Krishna is giving you intelligence how to do it nicely. Thank you very much.

So far your getting yourself married is concerned, I have no objection if it meets with Karandhara's approval. It appears that Lilasakti is a very good preacher, so help each other to become better and better preachers of this Krishna Consciousness movement. Don't fall astray. Separation is absolutely forbidden at any time. Always think of Krishna and be happy.

I am in due receipt of your daksina and that of Purusottama also ($10. check). Thank you for the same.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
