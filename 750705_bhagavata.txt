Calcutta

My dear Bhagavata das:

Please accept my blessings. Tripauri Swami is starting his bus preaching program, and you are required for this purpose. You are a good preacher. I very much like these bus programs. They are greatly increasing the scope of our book distribution and many new men are being attracted. So you should immediately come here to USA. You may hand over the management of Calcutta affairs to Bhavananda Maharaja.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
