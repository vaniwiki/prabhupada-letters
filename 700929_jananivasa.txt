My dear Jananivasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated Sept. 18, 1970. I am very glad that you have taken to heart the instructions of your Spiritual Master. A bona fide disciple takes the instructions of his Spiritual Master as his life and soul and thus he is advanced on the path of devotional service.

You are a very intelligent and sincere devotee of Lord Krsna and you have a natural inclination for preaching His message. This is the proper spirit for our Movement, so go on with increased enthusiasm preaching in the different schools and colleges in the vicinity and Krsna will give you more intelligence for serving Him properly. I am pleased to learn that you have got a course at the Ohio State University; the students received me very nicely when I spoke there last year, so please continue their instruction in this most important subject of Krsna Consciousness bhakti cult.

Regarding your proposed marriage, if you think it is nice then you have all my blessings upon you both. If you do not think you can remain brahmacari, then it is better to remain in Krsna Consciousness as householder and not pretend to brahmacarya artificially. From your description the girl seems very qualified and sincere, so you continue to train her in our Krsna Conscious way of life and she will work together with you as your helpmate in Krsna's service.

I am very glad to know that you are going on with your work undaunted in spite of police harassment. Now you are seven devotees there, so please see that everything is done regularly and strictly to the standard devotional practice. All our literatures are for guiding you in your successful prosecution of Krsna Consciousness, so follow these instructions of mine implicitly and your perfection of life in Krsna's service is guaranteed and you will have the spiritual strength for attracting and training others in this bhakti cult.

Please offer my blessings to all the devotees and keep me informed about your progress regularly. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
