My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated 7 March, 1970. I have received your tape yesterday, but without waiting for this tape, I have already recorded a speech and several songs also. The tape is already dispatched to you by air mail. Please acknowledge receipt. The typed copy of the lecture also you will find along with the record.

Yes, because the transcendental sound vibration directly appeals to the soul, therefore everyone will take it if the vibration is made by a pure devotee. We should therefore try to fix up our mind to remain in our spiritual position by chanting and following the regulative principles. Both in our American and European centers things are improving, and I hope you shall also do the needful.

I am very glad to learn that you have engaged one older Japanese lady for translating our lectures. This is a great opportunity that you have got a good translator. Give her sufficient work for translating, and certainly she will turn to be Krishna Consciousness. Regarding your projected study of all aspects of Japanese language---writing, reading, and speaking---for spreading Krishna Consciousness to all the Japanese speaking people all over the world, that is just our program, and you should do this without fail. As you have written that Tokyo is the largest city in the world and there is no limit to the scope of our preaching work there, your work there is very important to spread our mission.

I am so pleased to learn that you have held several successful kirtanas and also you were on the T.V. program. So now we are in the news and people will be inquiring more about our movement, so your progress in preaching Lord Caitanya's message in Tokyo is very much encouraging to me, and I am so happy to note your sincere determination in this matter. When you are able to find out a house for inviting interested persons to live in our Krishna Consciousness community, that will be very much helpful.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Cintamani Dasi, and to Bhurijana who is your valuable aide, and to all the other boys and girls there. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
