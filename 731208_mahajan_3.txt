My dear Mahajan, Sharanagata devi and Bhaktim Hera,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note and offering of December 3, 1973 and on behalf of my Guru Maharaj I humbly accept it. I am happy to have you as my second initiated disciples and I request that you take this responsibility very seriously and carry on with this Krsna consciousness Movement. Always be strong in our principles and faithful in Krsna and Guru and success is guaranteed.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
