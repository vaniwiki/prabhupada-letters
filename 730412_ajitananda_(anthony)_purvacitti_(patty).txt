My dear Spiritual Son and Daughter:

Please accept my blessings. On the recommendation of Gunagrahi Das I am pleased to accept you as my initiated disciples. I am giving you spiritual names as follows: Anthony is Ajita-ananda and Patty is Purvacitti, wife of Maharaja Agnidra.

You send a copy of this letter to Kirtanananda Swami and he will send you your japa beads duly chanted upon as I have prescribed. Now my special request is that you strictly follow the four regulative principles. This will keep you strong in Krishna consciousness. Nor should you neglect the Ten Offenses against the Holy Name. Just chant Hare Krishna in this way, and you will feel yourself advancing in spiritual life. This is the program of Lord Caitanya for us. So you do these things and that will please me very much.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
