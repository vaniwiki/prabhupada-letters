My dear Bhurijana, Tosana Krishna and Vrindaban Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your sending me the check for 200 dollars for my book fund, and I think of it as a big contribution of 2,000,000 dollars. I have come to your country to carry out the wishes of my Spiritual Master, and you are kindly cooperating with me. Certainly Krishna will be pleased to bless you with all spiritual benediction. I shall be glad to hear from you about your other progress in the matter of Sankirtana Party and selling __BTG__s. That is our main strength for preaching work. Thank you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
