My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I understand you have left and it is a thunderbolt for me. How is that?

What are your demands? Or have you also been contaminated? Please tell me frankly. Where is your wife and child? If there is any disagreement with your Godbrothers, you may live separately. That doesn't matter. If there is any severe misunderstanding, I request you to come to India and live with me and start a press here.

I shall await your reply with great anxiety. Please let me know everything in detail by return mail.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
