Dear S.B. Bartarya,

I am in receipt of your letter dated October 6, 1976 and have noted the contents carefully. I shall be returning to Vrindaban on the 20th October and shall be glad to see you any day thereafter at 4:30 PM. Please bring this letter with you and show it to my secretary on my arrival.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Respectfully yours,
