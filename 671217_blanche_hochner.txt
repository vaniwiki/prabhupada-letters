My dear Blanche Hochner,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter Nov. 21. I reply late because I have come back to San Francisco on the 14th Dec. I can understand your position in Krishna Consciousness from your letter and I reply it appears that Krishna Consciousness is acting upon you. You very rightly say that we cannot really give anything to Krishna because everything belongs to Him already. Therefore the energy which we have received from Krishna should be utilized for Krishna's service. Devotional service means to apply one's energy in the service of Krishna. That is the instruction of the Bhagavad-gita. You know that all our girl disciples are applying their energy in the service of Krishna. Jadurani, Govinda dasi, and other girls, they are very sincerely applying their energy in the service of Krishna and I wish that you also do the same. Yes, we cannot understand about Krishna with our limited potency and senses, but if we engage ourselves in the service of the Lord, He will reveal Himself to the faithful servitor.

Advaita has written me about your marriage. I think both of you should wait a little more till my arrival in N.Y. I shall personally perform your marriage ceremony.

You have rightly said that learning more and more about Krishna makes you so happy. The more we learn about Krishna from the authoritative sources, the more we can be attached in Krishna Consciousness. I shall chant all the beads today at the time of the initiation and send you by post tomorrow. Your initiated name will be Balai dasi.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
