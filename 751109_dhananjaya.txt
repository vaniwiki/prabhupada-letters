My dear Dhananjaya das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 5, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the Krishna Balarama Gosala, so let them arrange the meeting of the Trustees. I am in India, so let them arrange the date, time, and place, and I shall go there. There is no difficulty for me to attend. But, let them do it.

The land on Chatikara Road is very good. We can develop it. Your Govardhana Puja celebration sounded very nice.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am also in receipt of your letters dated October 20 & 21, 1975. I note that your wife and Visalaini both gave birth to baby girls. That is the defect. I want male children but you have no stamina for it. I expected from Visalaini by her belly that it would be a boy. Anyway, never mind. The name Brijlata is nice. Why do the majority of my married disciples give birth to girls? That is nice that Upendra wants to stay and is calling for his family. Anyone who can stay permanently is welcome. I want that as many devotees stay permanently and become Brijabasis. That will be very inspiring. I am coming there soon. ACBS\\
