My dear Karandhara Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 25, 1973 and have noted the contents. So far yourself is concerned, whatever is done is done. Now go on with your duty and do it nicely. You are an intelligent devotee. You can understand.

Now one thing for Caitanya Mahaprabhu's Appearance Day, I want that there be published one volume of Caitanya Caritamrta. You have got the Ādi lila from Chapter Seven onwards. So at least one volume must be published of 400 pages, hardbound edition. Copies must be there in Mayapur for distribution on the appearance day. So please arrange for this.

Another thing is that now my program is fixed up for going to Nairobi on November 23, instant, and from there I will return to Los Angeles via Rome. I will stop there for two days for meeting with the Pope. So I may request you to send one ticket for Pradyumna (P. . Sherbow) Nairobi-Rome-Los Angeles.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
