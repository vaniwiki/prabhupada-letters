====== Letter to: Gurukrpa ======

Tokyo

My dear Gurukrpa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings.

Yesterday, Gopala Krsna spoke with Ramesvara Maharaja, and it is understood that you are waiting for a letter from me before sending the second amount of $100,000. It is also understood that no money will be coming this month from the BBT. Therefore you can arrange to immediately send the $100,000 to the Bank of America, Express Towers, Nariman Point, Bombay, India to the advice and credit of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness Mayapur-Vrndavana Fund, Account no. 16026. Please advise me when this transfer has been made.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
