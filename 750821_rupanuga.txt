Deaplane, Virginia

My dear Rupanuga das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 3, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the Washington temple why are you selling the present building? Why are you changing it? We are not businessmen that we sell for profit and then move the Deity. Develop the farm in New York nicely. Show by example what it means plain living and high thinking. Regarding the letter to the lawyer, I have heard from Brahmananda Swami that the lawyers did not like the letter and threatened to Ramesvara that if it was not retracted then they would bring suit. So if necessary then retract it. Do not write in a way to accuse them. Just terminate their service. So after retracting, then write a new one.

Regarding your questions, no, the large Deity can never be moved, not at all. Regarding remarriage, no, remarriage should be always discouraged. Remarriage means encouraging sense gratification. Our mission is to curtail sense gratification. Three times marrying in a year, this is not good, and they are doing this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
