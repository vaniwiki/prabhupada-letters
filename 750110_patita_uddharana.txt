My dear Patita Uddharana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of you letter dated Jan. 4th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I very much appreciated your nice report on London and I am glad to hear how things are going on there. Many thanks to Prabha Visnu das.

Yes, I'll come there, but the first opportunity may be in April. I am also hankering to go there. Please take great care, you are experienced. Co-operate with Prabha Visnu and make an ideal place for devotional service there.

Regarding the incident with Mr. Mody, it was a mistake by Kausalya. Don't commit anything which will cause mistrust. This is not at all desirable. Keep peaceful situation with all men. There is no question of taxing someone for a donation. They can give donation and we will accept on friendly terms. Nobody should be pressured for contribution.

Impure atmosphere can be counteracted by having kirtanas twice and thrice daily with dancing. So, keep the atmosphere very peacefully. Go on chanting and hold classes in Bhagavatam, etc. Don't allow anyone to engage in eating and sleeping alone or the devil's workshop will develop.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
