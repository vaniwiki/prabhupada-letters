My dear Hit Sharanji,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from you in some time. I hope you are doing well. I am anxious to know what happened to the other two pairs of Deities. These two pairs of Deities are immediately required for Paris and Berlin.

So I will be very much pleased if you dispatch them immediately to Scindia Steam Navigation Co. as you did last time.

Kindly treat this as urgent, and let me know what is the situation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
