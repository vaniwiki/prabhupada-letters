My dear Rayarama, please accept my blessings. I am writing by hand so that you may know that I am better than before. Your programme as you have let me know in your letter of August 4, 1967 is nice. Follow it with faith in Krishna and everything will come out successful. I have taken leave from you for six months but Krishna willing I may be with you in the month of November next. If in the meantime your London Branch is opened then I shall stop in London before going to U.S.A. We have tremendous task before us. Vrindaban is an inspiration only but our real field of work is all over the world. Even if I die you are my future hopes & you will do it. I am feeling very much for you all. Please let the ball roll on just as it is set. Make the Boston center still more powerful because it will be an important center. What about Washington? I am anxious to know if Brahmananda met the Ambassador of U.S.A., Mr. B. K. Nehru, with my books. If so how he was received and what talks were exchanged. He is very important man for our future activities. Please ask Brahmananda to write about Ambassador Nehru & the MacMillan contract. Gargamuni may be informed that I am in receipt of his letters regarding marriage with Karunamayi. I have already sanctioned the urge in Brahmananda's letter. I hope Brahmananda has already managed the affairs nicely. Convey my blessings to all my sons & daughters.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
