====== Letter to: Sri Trivediji ======

Scindia Co.\\
Calcutta

Dear Sri Trivediji,

Please accept my greetings. Since I received your letter dated July 18th, 1970, I have not heard anything from you regarding the Murtis which are kept under your care.

The matter appears to be very complicated because I do not know why Sri Caitanya Research Institute has falsely declared to the Chief Controller of Import and Export that the Murtis were donated by them while that is not a fact. There were five pairs of Murtis, one pair being donated by Dalmia-Jayan Trust and the other four pairs being donated by the Birla Trust.

Anyway, it is practically near about one year the matter is being dragged. You will kindly therefore let me know by return mail what is the actual position and whether there is possibility of carrying the Murtis as previously arranged. If not, please let me know and I shall depute some of my representatives to take delivery of the Murtis and do the needful.

At the present moment I am in Japan at the above address, so kindly reply by sending to me here.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
