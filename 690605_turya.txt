My dear Turya das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of May 29, 1969, sent along with your beads, and I have duly chanted upon them and have initiated you as my disciple. Your spiritual name is Turya das and this means transcendental. So you are the servant of the Transcendental Lord, Krishna, and when one serves the Transcendental Lord, he also becomes completely transcendental to the laws and contaminations of material nature. In material life, everyone is bound up tightly by the laws of karma, and there is no question of transcending these laws by any material means. The modern civilization is trying to transcend the pangs of material life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, by advancement of material knowledge, but actually this advancement is only binding them more tightly into the material concept of life. So thus there is no freedom from or transcending of these material miseries. But one who comes to the intelligence to understand that rather than serving the cause of material advancement, he should serve the cause of Krishna, then such person becomes transcendental to the stringent laws of karma. Krishna instructs us in __Bhagavad-gita__ that one who serves Him in loving devotional service is delivered fully from all material contamination.

Now you have your beads, so please chant at least 16 rounds daily, and read from __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ at least one chapter daily. Gaurasundara will instruct you as to the 10 offenses that must be avoided. The four principal regulative restrictions that you must follow are 1) no intoxication, including coffee or tea, 2) no illicit sex-life, 3) no nonvegetarian diet, 4) no gambling. I understand from Gaurasundara that already you are helping the Hawaii temple and that you are a very nice, sincere boy. So with these nice qualifications of sincerity and service surely you will make nice progress in perfecting your life in Krishna consciousness. As you are having questions about this great spiritual science of __Bhagavad-gita,__ please consult with Gaurasundara, he is a very intelligent boy, and I am also always at your service to help as far as possible.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
