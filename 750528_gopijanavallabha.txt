My dear Gopijanavallabha dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 25, 1975 and have noted the contents. If this building in New York is the best one available, then we must get it. By Krishna's grace, things may work out so that we can get that building. I shall be seeing Alfred Ford here soon so at that time, we can discuss further and we shall inform you if we can devise a plan to get the building with Alfred's help.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
