My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. Now it is decided that I shall be starting on the 11th of September, Thursday, by flight 234, Lufthansa Airlines, starting at 12:15 Hamburg time, and reaching London at 13:40. So you can make the necessary arrangements. If you have any further information for me, you can send me a letter immediately or talk with me. Yesterday Vyasa Puja was held in the temple, and your tape of Cintamani was played. It was very nice.

Please offer my blessings to the others, I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
