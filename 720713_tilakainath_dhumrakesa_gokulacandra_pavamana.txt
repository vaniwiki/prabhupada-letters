My dear Sons,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Giriraja I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. Your initiated names are as follows:

Tom/Tilakainath das

Doug/Dhumrakesa das

George/Gokulacandra das

Paul/Pavamana das

Now please continue to strictly follow the regulative principles, namely: no eating of meat, fish, or eggs; no intoxicants, including tea, coffee, cigarettes; no illicit sex-life; and no gambling.

If you stick to these principles with determination, then you will become free from all attachment to Maya, by Krishna's grace. The example is that when the sun is in the sky, there is no question of darkness. Similarly, when Hare Krishna Mantra is vibrating on your tongue and you are hearing attentively, then your consciousness becomes clear, or Krishna Consciousness, and there is no question of Maya or hazy consciousness. Just as when the light and the darkness come together, the darkness cannot stand before the light, so Maya cannot remain in the presence of Krishna. Always remember, therefore, to chant Hare Krishna, and that will save you in all circumstances without any doubt.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
