My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5th October, 1971 and have noted the contents. So we all combined together have taken a great task of this Krsna Consciousness movement so I am very glad to learn that you are all gradually understanding the importance of this movement. So let us execute this task very cautiously so that the human society may take advantage of it and make their life successful. It is not that everyone will be able to understand this philosophy. Still if some intelligent section of the human society understands it, there will be tremendous change in the atmosphere. So I am glad to understand also that there is good chance for opening a branch in New Zealand. I think that you may remember that when we were coming from Sydney to Calcutta we were talking on the plane about opening a branch in New Zealand country.

I have not heard for many days about Kuala Lumpur activities and also Hong Kong. I hope you might have received news from them. So I wish that you may stay for some time in Delhi to recoup your health. Delhi climate is now very good. So you take in the morning sugar candy juice. Just soak some sugar candy overnight in water and take early in the morning and that will help you. Don't take any fatty vegetables (too much ghee and spices). Take green vegetables in salad with lime juice. Green papaya boiled is also nice.

Hoping this will meet you in rapidly improving health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
