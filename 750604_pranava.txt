Vrndavana

My dear Pranava,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 26, 1975 and have noted the contents. I agree to give Sri Ghanshyam das amount that you have mentioned, and he must donate the 25,000 rs. and he can be a patron member with his brother. But, why you are asking for so much? You do not need 1 1/4 lakhs. You only need 75,000 rs. Anyway the money can be paid by PNB upon my request, but first you make the sales agreement, then you take the owners' documents to our lawyer to make sure they are actually bona fide, and the lawyer will give a title certificate, if they are bona fide. Then you make the deed conveyance, and take it to the registration office for being registered. Then upon registration, at that time, you give the payment. Not before that time. So, by the time you have done all this, the money will be ready for you. The land should be put in the name of International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Mayapur-Vrndavana Trust, Founder-Acarya A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Why the guest house not yet started? Please let me know about this.\\
