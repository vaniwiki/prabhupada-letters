My dear Tejyas dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 29, 1975 and have noted the contents. Yes, I have seen the spot for the factory-mandir. Go ahead with the plans and send me a copy of the plans. It is very nice that Mr. Patnai will help us. Persist in that direction. He will be a great help if he can get some land for us. Also Mr. Agarwal can try. We want to have a park in front of Buddha-Jayanti park. We shall call it Krishna-Jayanti Park. We can have our temple there, along with gosala, etc. Try to arrange these things.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
