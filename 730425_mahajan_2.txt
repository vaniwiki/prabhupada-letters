My dear Mahajan and Sharanagata,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note along with the $60.00 daksina, and I thank you very much. Now you have taken this initiation, and it is a very serious matter. You must always keep very strongly to the principles of Krishna consciousness; rising early, taking bath, attending mongol aratrik, chanting at least 16 rounds on the beads daily, reading our books, going for sankirtan as much as possible. These things, if strictly followed, will keep you always in a purified condition and will give you spiritual strength to defeat maya, and when this body is finished, no more material bodies, but back to home, back to Godhead. This Krishna consciousness is so nice, so sublime. Take it and be happy.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
