====== Letter to: Vegavan ======

Stockholm

My dear Vegavan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 76/12/03.

Regarding the question you have asked, you can give a very straight answer. Bhagavad-gita says, "__dehantara praptih__" [[books:bg:2:13|(Bg. 2.13)]]. The soul transmigrates, but there is no regular process. In the beginning of creation, when all the world was water, all living entities were aquatics. Then gradually from aquatics the soul passes into plant bodies, then insect bodies, then bird bodies, then animal bodies, then human beings. In the human form the soul can decide whether to go back to home, back to Godhead or return to birth and death, accepting material bodies according to his karma. Therefore, it is advised to take advantage of the human form of body to go back home, back to Godhead. Our movement is for this purpose, to offer all human beings a chance to go back home, back to Godhead.

That is very good news that they are going to use our __Bhagavad-gita as it is__ in the high schools. That you are getting new devotees who are not from Sweden doesn't matter. Anyone coming is welcome.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
