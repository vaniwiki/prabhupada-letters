My dear Madhusudana,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter brought to me by Rayarama. Yes, 15 minutes is sufficient time for the offering to remain on the altar. You do not need to lay down Lord Jagannatha on a bed, by mantra you say my dear Lord please take rest. In temples, there are two sets of deities, the big set is always on the throne, and the smaller set is handled, taken out for a stroll, laid to bed, etc. There is no difference in the small and large set, of course.

The prayer means: I offer my respectful obeisances to my Spiritual Master who has opened my eyes by the torch of knowledge, while I was in the darkness of ignorance.

That book of speeches by Bhaktisaranga Goswami may be kept carefully. It has to be returned. In meantime, if you like, you can copy it by typewriter.

My dear boy, lecturing for Krishna has nothing to do with this body. If I would not have lectured, how you would have come? So as far as possible I am taking care of my health, but Krishna's service must be executed, even at the risk of life. A living entity gets millions of opportunities to get a type of body, but hardly he gets opportunity to serve Krishna. The service of Krishna must be executed at all risks, but do not worry; I am taking care of my health by the help of Gaurasundara. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
