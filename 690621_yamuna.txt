My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14 June, 1969, and I have noted the contents. I have already been informed about your London house from the others. The day before yesterday I received one cable from Mukunda asking for a loan of $1,025.00 for depositing three months' rent on the house. I have advised New York to cable the money immediately, and I hope Mukunda has already received the money and the transaction is nicely terminated. Previously, I received one letter from your center, signed by Mukunda, Syamasundara, Gurudasa, and others, inviting me to London by the 20th of July. In the meantime, I have received one urgent letter from Los Angeles to go there, and therefore I am going to Los Angeles on the 23rd instant. But there will be no difficulty for me to go to London from Los Angeles, provided that by that time you are well equipped. Otherwise, there is no need of hurrying. Do everything peacefully and conveniently. I have asked one married couple from Montreal, Isanadas and Vibhavati, to go to London, as well as I have asked one brahmacari named Trivikrama, and probably Sudama will also go there. So nicely organize your Sankirtana Party, and go on with your regular program of preaching Krishna Consciousness.

I understand that Mataji is going to donate one pair of Sri Murtis. I do not know what size they will be, but I have also ordered one pair of Sri Murtis, 24" high. I hope your arrangements for Rathayatra Ceremony are going ahead, and I shall be glad to hear from you at my Los Angeles address. I am very much encouraged to learn that your kirtana is going to be held at Oxford University, which is the most important university in the world. At least in India, if somebody is a graduate of Oxford University, he is very highly respected, and immediately he gets some good job in the government's service. So if your Sankirtana program becomes recognized by the Oxonians, it will be a great credit for you.

I am enclosing a list of fasting days and festivals days which you should observe nicely. Also enclosed is a letter for Gurudasa, which you may please hand over to him. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
