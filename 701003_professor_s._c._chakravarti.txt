Sri Professor S.C. Chakravarti,\\
D. Litt.\\
Bolpur, India

Dear Sriman Sudhindra Babu,

Please accept my blessings. I am so pleased to receive your postcard dated 18th Sept., 1970. Unfortunately, I could not reply it very promptly on account of various engagements here almost twice, thrice daily besides my routine work. You will please excuse me.

I am so glad to learn that you are interested in the matter of Vaisnava philosophy. Vaisnava philosophy is very simple: that God is great and everyone is His servant. Nobody can be equal to or greater than God. They are simultaneously one and different. In quality they are one, but in magnitude they are different. This is the whole philosophy of the four Vaisnava sampradayas.

As we are now preaching Vaisnava philosophy throughout the world as a whole, your valuable service is most welcome. Most probably I am going out of station by the 5th instant and shall come back by the 20th or by the end of this month. If you kindly see me by that time it shall be very much appreciated and we can talk about this cooperation in detail.

Regarding our institution, please read the enclosed pamphlet and you will know the synopsis of our propaganda work and as well you will find herewith enclosed a booklist of our publications.

Thanking you once more for your kind letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
