Bombay

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I have met with Mrs. Morarji on arriving here in London and she has agreed to be the President of our Bombay Board of Trustees for building up the Juhu project. This is a good opportunity. So she, along with our other big Life Members, can form this Committee, and our own men will give direction. Now form the Committee by consulting her how to do it, and the Committee may meet and organize how to raise funds and push on this project, and I shall give direction how to do it.

Now one thing is, she wants us to come to her school and give classes in Krishna Consciousness, so you go there with others as often as possible and give instruction to the children, bring them to our temple, distribute prasadam, like that. More and more, she will become favorably disposed as she sees us that we are performing the best welfare activity. Kindly inform me how these matters are making progress.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
