My dear Marie Priterel,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 4, 1973, which I have read carefully.

It is most unfortunate to hear of the manner in which you have been mistreated by the doctors. But what can be done now about that? At least you have now had the good fortune to come in contact with my disciples. So now you can begin a new life. It does not matter that you do not live within our temple, since you say your health does not permit. But you can make your home a temple for Krsna. First thing is that you should try to follow strictly our regulative principles---no meat, fish or eggs; no intoxicants, including coffee, tea and cigarettes; no illicit sex; and no gambling. Try also to chant as many times as possible the Hare Krsna mantra on japa beads. You may keep a picture of Lord Krsna in your house and after cooking you may learn to offer the foodstuffs to the picture of Krsna. In this way the food you eat will be offered and be spiritual and will help you to advance spiritually. Whenever possible try to visit our temple and attend the kirtanas and discourses. I am sure that the temple president can suggest some way in which you can render some service, if you are willing.

Thank you for taking a keen interest in our Krsna Consciousness movement.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
