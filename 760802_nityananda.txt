My dear Nityananda das;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and have noted the contents with care.

On your recommendation I am accepting the following disciples for first and second initiation:\\
__First Initiation__:\\
Michael Hyldahl---Vamsimohana dasa\\
Rodolfo Rios---Rasa-Vilasa dasa\\
James Lanclos---Jnana-natha dasa\\
Willie Butch McCord---Vaninatha Raya dasa\\
__Second Initiation__:\\
Jitamitra das brahmacary

Hold a fire sacrifice and present the beads and gayatri mantra tape with brahmana thread at that time. The initiates should follow our four principles of Godly life namely; no eating of meat, fish or eggs; no gambling, no intoxication, and no illicit sex. All devotees must also chant the prescribed 16 rounds on the beads daily, without fail. Enclosed you will find one brahmana thread and gayatri mantra. After the fire sacrifice the tape of the gayatri mantra should be played into the right ear of the initiate. To become a brahmana means to be always clean outside by regular cleanliness and inside by chanting the Hare Krishna maha mantra. The beads for the first initiates should be chanted on by your GBC man and the names given at the time of the sacrifice.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
