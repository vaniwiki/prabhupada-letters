My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated September 7th and 10th, 1969, and I have noted the contents. You write in your letter of September 10th that you have not received my replies, but I reply each and every letter. Especially your letters, Brahmananda's letters, Satsvarupa's letters and Gargamuni's letters I take special care and reply each of them. I hope by this time you have received my reply. Regarding the house, I have answered this point in one of my letters. But one thing I must let you know is that I may be a poor man's son, or a poor man myself, but fortunately I have been transferred to America to become rich man's father. So I wish to live like rich man's father, as there are many American rich man's fathers. Now you can do whatever you like. But one thing I can suggest is that we are now getting our own press, and as we have got so many books, if you can arrange for the selling of these books, there will be no scarcity of money either for the father or for the son.

I am pleased to note that you will be giving four classes in Los Angeles universities this year, and everyone is welcome to appear in the Bhakti-sastri examination and take the title. But one must be acquainted with Krishna philosophy at least for one year. So the students may attend class for one year as you have already arranged, and if they learn this philosophy, even if they don't become initiated students, it will be a pleasure for us. Regarding the tests you are holding there in Los Angeles, keep them there, and when I return I shall see them personally. I am encouraged to learn that you now have a very nice place for photography work, and you can send me photographs of the size of __TLC__ of pictures for the __Krishna__ book and __Nectar of Devotion.__ For __Krishna__ you have the pictures by Jadurani, Jahnava and Murlidhara. Then there is the Radha-Krishna picture by Devahuti, the Radha-Krishna picture which was kept in my room on the wall just to my righthand side, and the Radha-Krishna picture which was kept on my altar while I was there on Formosa Avenue.

Regarding __Aquarian Gospel of Lord Jesus The Christ,__ I have taken some stray extracts just to support our views, but we don't give any importance to that book. The best thing is that we accept Lord Jesus Christ as a great devotee of the Lord and the son of God. It is better not to discuss in any detail about the Christian religion or any other religion. Your idea for Rukmini and her husband, Bharadraja, to go to Chicago is nice. I understand that Sudama and Bali Mardan have already gone to Japan and I am anxious to get their address.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
