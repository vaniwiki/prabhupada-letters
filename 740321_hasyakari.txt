Dear Hasyakari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of names recommended by your for first initiation. On your word I have accepted them as my disciples and their spiritual names are as follows.

Philip Cote---Phanamandita dasa\\
Keith Weber---Kalpavrksa dasa\\
Ron Burnstein---Muktakesa dasa\\
Cheryl Denbroff---Siladitya devi dasi\\
Candy Burton---Kamya devi dasi\\
Pam Parker---Padmahara devi dasi

You may send their beads to Rupanuga Maharaja for chanting. Hold a fire yajna in the temple and impress on all these new devotees that they must chant at least 16 rounds daily, without fail and refrain from the four sinful activities. If one observes just these principles he will be rapid progress in spiritual life.

I am also accepting the following devotees for second initiation: Krpamaya das Brahmacari and Gopinatha devi dasi. I am enclosing one sacred thread and gayatri mantra. Get the tape of me chanting the gayatri and have them hear it in the right ear. This initiation should be taken very seriously, and those who accept it have to prove exemplary or it will become a farce.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
