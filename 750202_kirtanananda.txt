====== Letter to: Kirtanananda ======

New Vrndavana

My dear Kirtanananda Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your recommendations for initiations received on the 2nd of Feb., 1975. I have accepted the ten devotees you have named and their new names are as follows: Gregory---Gaurasakti dasa, Walker---Venkata dasa, Patrick---Parisevana dasa, Barbara---Vibhavari devi dasi, Anne---Amrtaprada devi dasi, Sheryl---Sobhavati, Mary---Mahadevi dasi, Donna---Damagrahya devi daski, Marie---Mudakari devi dasi, Catherine---Kratuphalas devi dasi. You may chant on their japa beads.

I have also accepted upon your recommendation, Hunkara dasa, Stavya dasa, Maha devi dasi, Demagrahya devi dasi and Mudakari devi dasi as my duly initiated brahmanas. Let them hear the gayatri mantra through the right ear from the tape of myself saying it. Their threads and a mantra sheet are enclosed herein.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
