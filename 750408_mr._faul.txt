My dear Mr. Faul,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. I am glad to hear that you have visited our temple in L.A. If you carefully study our movement around the world, you will find that actually we are solving all of the so-called problems of life. I request you to take an active part in our movement as much as possible and your spiritual understanding will increase manifold.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
