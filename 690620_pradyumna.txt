My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of June 17, 1969, and I have noted the contents. It is all right to have the changes made on the two type fonts because it will be suitable for our purposes. I have already written you a letter that you have to maintain the machine. That means the monthly installments shall be arranged by you, and the cash down shall be paid by me. I have already advised Brahmananda in this connection so you can do the needful.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
