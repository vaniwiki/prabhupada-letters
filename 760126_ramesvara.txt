Sri Sri Radha Damodara TSKP\\
Tempe, Arizona

My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated January 16th, 1976, and I have noted the contents.

Regarding supplying the Radha Damodara TSKP books at discount, there is no harm. The BBT should charge them the printing cost only and the balance they will send to India. It is the same as before, but instead of the money being sent to the BBT and then to India, this is shortcut and the money will go directly to India. As their collections depend entirely on book distribution, whatever amount they transfer here plus the amount paid to BBT in Los Angeles may be combined for listing in your monthly ratings as book distribution. In this way they will be encouraged to go on increasing the book distribution more and more and at the same time they will be encouraged to send more and more for the construction. There is no question of discounting them ore money than is needed in India, because we require crores and crores of unlimited funds. America has the money, so this is co-operation between the blind men and lame men. This will be a good name to your country, that Americans are building such nice buildings. It will make good relations between India and America. The next chance I have for meeting with Indira Gandhi I shall inform her about how much foreign exchange we are sending. After receiving your encouraging assurance that as book distribution increases the amount BBT sends will also increase, we are now going to attempt the Kuruksetra project and the Jagannatha Puri project. For the time being we are spending in India, but eventually we will spend everywhere. This will greatly enhance the American's spiritual position.

Always remain dependent on Guru and Krishna and your progress will always be assured.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
