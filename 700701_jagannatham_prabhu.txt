ALL GLORY TO SRI GURU AND GAURANGA!!

My dear Jagannatham Prabhu,

Please accept my humble obeisances. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letter dated 24th June, 1970, and I am very glad to learn that your last responsibilities in family affairs are now discharged, your two daughters are now married. Now in this ripe old age you can devote yourself for spreading Krsna Consciousness Movement all over the world.

Your son is here, so I think with your daughter-in-law you can also come in this country. So far I understand there is some difficulty in getting visa for your daughter-in-law, but as far as I know the immigration laws, if your son is an immigrant he can bring in his wife immediately and without any difficulty. Anyway, whenever your son will meet me I will be so much pleased to take care of him.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
