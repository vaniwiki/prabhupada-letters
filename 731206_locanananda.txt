My dear Locanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 2, 1973. From the Vedic point of view a man can have more than one wife provided he can maintain each of them very nicely. The practical example is our Lord Krsna. He had 16,108 wives but for each wife he maintained a palace with servants and everything. We do not encourage more than one wife, but provided the man is highly responsible and conscientious and the woman agrees then we have no objection.

The thing is how you will maintain two wives? You cannot give up one and take another. We cannot be responsible. You will have to manage everything and if there is any legal implication then we cannot be responsible. The Temple cannot pay for you to have two wives so it must be arranged for outside.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
