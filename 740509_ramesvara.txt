My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated April 28 and 29 and I have noted the contents.

Your letters are a great pleasure for me to read. You are always broadcasting the glories of the Sankirtana movement in the shape of ISKCONs book distribution and surely you will be recognized by Lord Caitanya for your unbounded enthusiasm and expertise in seeing that my books are distributed all over the world.

In your letter of April 29 you give the astounding report that in the year 1973, 4,169,004 total books were bought by the temples from BBT. What is the calculation of money collected for that amount?

This regular reporting is very encouraging for everyone of our devotees and I have faith in your words that next year the figures will be far beyond what they were last year. It is the nature of the spiritual energy, it is always increasing if we just apply our energy.

The report of the BBT traveling library party is something new for us and this is also only the beginning. Please give my heartful thanks to the boys, Sriman Maha Buddhi dasa Brahmacari and Sriman Ghanasyama dasa Brahmacari. These books are specifically meant for the intellectual class of people in your country and I have great hope in the results of this preaching at the Universities.

I received one rumor that the Sankirtana parties in the US would soon be stopped by political repression and lack of money by the people. Some so-called devotee was thinking like that but you can assure all your men that I have great hope for Krishna Consciousness in America, more than any other place. And there is no question of repression provided we go on sincerely.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
