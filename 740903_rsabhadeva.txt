My dear Rsabhadeva das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 16/8/74 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following as my initiated disciples and their names are as follows:

1. David Bowmar---Dhanviganesa das\\
2. Kenneth Venezia---Kalanka das\\
3. James Sullivan---Jagattraya das\\
4. Walter Parry---Vrndapati das\\
5. Michael Matlock---Mangaladata das\\
6. Christina Wroth---Kriyasakti devi

Please see that they strictly follow all the principles, chanting 16 rounds daily. This is also for the older disciples as well.

Yes, as you have suggested Dr. Wolf-Rotkay can write to me requesting initiation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
