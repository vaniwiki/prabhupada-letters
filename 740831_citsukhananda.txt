My dear Citsukhananda das;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 19, 1974, with enclosed clippings and a copy of the Hare Krishna News. Your work there is very much pleasing to me. Take good attention to the negroes and they will come out good devotees. How many copies have you printed of your local newspaper? I think that everyone will be interested in it. Regarding life membership, Brahmananda Swami can instruct you. You say that the money can be sent out; there are no objections from the government to do this? Please give the details how you can send the money here.

One thing, is the Society registered there?

So I am glad to learn that you are with your wife and doing very nicely. Combine together and do everything well together. Raise your children in Krishna consciousness and be an ideal household couple. Your wife is a good devotee, that I know. But one thing, do not pick up any childish quarrels together, live peacefully and go on with your Krishna conscious business. You deserve all good encouragement for the work you are doing there.

Regarding the plans for the temple, you should send to Saurabha a site plan for the area of the plot and then he can send you the plans. If possible also send photos of the plot. Be sure and mention what is the exact area of the plot and he can make the plans accordingly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
