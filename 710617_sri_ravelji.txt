Sri V.D. Ravel Esqr.\\
Calcutta

My dear Sri Ravelji

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your three letters dated 30th May, 8th and 9th June, 1971 respectively and have noted the contents. It appears from your writings that you are a true devotee of the Lord and you have respect for other devotees. That is a very good sign of a devotee. I am very much obliged to you for your appreciation. I want your blessings also for the task taken up by me to spread this Krishna Consciousness movement all over the world.

On the 20th instant I will be going to Moscow for five days, and then on to Paris and London. From there I will go directly to U.S.A. and hope to be back in Calcutta by the middle of August for opening our Mayapur temple. In the mean time you can visit our temple there at 3, Albert Road, talk with the devotees, read all our books and when I return to Calcutta, we shall talk of further enlightenment.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
