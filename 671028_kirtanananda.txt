====== Letter to: Kirtanananda ======

My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I've received your note along with Brahmananda's for first time since you left to N.Y. You had no desire to stop in London. This is clear to me from Hayagriva's letter which indicated that you had already planned to go there even before you left India. Since you have returned to N.Y. you have falsely dictated that I do not want the robes or flags. Why are you disturbing the whole situation in my absence. I never ordered you to speak like that. They must continue to have robes & tilak & flags & they must distinguish themselves from the hippies. I never objected to any of my students dressing like nice American gentleman, clean shaved; but those who are my disciples must have flag, tilak & beads on the neck without fail. Anyway I never advised you to dictate on my behalf. Please therefore do not misrepresent me. You have been given sannyasa to follow my principles & not to disturb me. If you do not agree with my philosophy you can work independently and not within the walls of ISKCON. You have not understood Krishna properly. The best thing will be to stop your talks till my return & if you love me at all please do not talk in any meeting but chant in solitary place - anywhere you like. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
