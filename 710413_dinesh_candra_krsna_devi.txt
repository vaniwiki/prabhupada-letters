My dear Dinesh Candra and Krsna Devi,

Please accept my blessings. Last time I heard from you, you wanted to go to Jerusalem to start one center there and I agreed. Almost everything was settled up. What happened next? I thought that you had already gone. Presently I am making plans for going to Australia, Malaysia, and Russia also and I was planning to go to Jerusalem as well on my way to Russia. So let me know immediately in this connection what your plans are.

Just today I received another letter from Yacov Shames in Jerusalem (c/o Dr. Ritchie: 79 Rehov Bait Vegan; Bait Vegan; Jerusalem, Israel) and he is very much anxious to have me visit there, so I have consented that on my way to Russia I will go there for some time. I asked that you correspond with this boy in my previous letter but he makes no mention of it. What happened? Please let me know as soon as possible.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
