My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your most recent letter (undated), and I have noted the contents carefully. I am so much encouraged to learn that one very nice German boy has come to live in your temple. This is clear evidence that you are all working sincerely to serve Krishna, and now one sincere soul has been so attracted by this, that he is also coming to join you. Actually, if one true Vaisnava goes any place in the world, then the spiritual instincts of the more advanced souls he comes into contact with will be awakened, and they will automatically be attracted. In the __Bhagavad-gita,__ Krishna informs Arjuna that if in previous lifetimes one has begun the path of spiritual perfection but was unable to complete it for one reason or another, then in future lifetimes he will automatically become attracted again to spiritual life, and he will begin his progress from the point where he had previously left off. So throughout the material universes there are many such spiritually inclined souls, and our mission is to present to everyone right knowledge of spiritual life. In this way, those who are already interested may finish up there Krishna Consciousness business in this life, and similarly, those who are not so interested may advance themselves and make perfection of their life, simply by hearing our Sankirtana Party, attending our temple activities with association with devotees, and eating Krishna prasadam. Please take nice care of Oliver, and help him in whatever way you can. In Krishna Consciousness every man is so important because all of the activities of a devotee of Lord Krishna is beneficial to all living entities. So if there are any questions that he would like me to help him with, I am always at your service to help in any way I can.

Regarding your proposal to go to Paris, you will be pleased to learn that Janardana has already gone there two weeks ago, and he is thinking seriously how to spread Krishna Consciousness there. For the time being your services are required in Germany, so you must stay there for the present. Let us see how Janardana is arranging things in Paris, and when the time is right, if you are required to go there, then I shall instruct you in this regards. In the meantime, you are in Hamburg, so try to advance the success of your temple there as far as possible.

I have received Jaya Govinda's note along with the list of credits for German __BTG.__ Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
