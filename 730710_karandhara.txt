====== Letter to: Karandhara ======

Los Angeles

Dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I understand you are interested in when I am returning to Los Angeles. Actually just now in London we have instituted a program where important men are coming to meet with me in the evening for discussion of Krsna Consciousness. I have talked with a very famous sculptor, a teacher of a boys college and today George Harrison is supposed to visit. Syamasundara is arranging for visits by many other famous men. Wherever I shall go now this policy of important men being invited to talk with me about our Krsna Consciousness movement should be implemented.

You will be glad to know the Rathayatra in London was very successful. The Daily Guardian had a picture on the front page of our cart and stated that we were competition to the monument in memory of Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square. My health is good and I am taking daily walk and speaking at the class in the morning.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I shall return to L.A. by September.\\
