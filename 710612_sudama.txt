====== Letter to: Sudama ======

Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. Just recently I have received one very interesting letter from Damari Toshio Inove and the reply to his letter is enclosed herewith. His letter I am sending to Satsvarupa and he may publish it in Back To Godhead. Here is a boy who was about to commit suicide, but he came to Krishna instead and now he is perfecting his life. That is most encouraging news.

So now this boy is working with you cooperatively; train him up nicely and give him all guidance. Any questions that you cannot answer may be referred to me. Krishna has sent you a sincere soul to help out there. So together work very hard to develop New Gaya and more devotees will come. Simply you must be patient and depend on Krishna, and He will give you all facility.

Presently I am in Bombay and on the 20th of this month I will go to Moscow for five days. From there I go to Paris and then London for Rathayatra festival. After the festival I will return to U.S.A.; N.Y. and then L.A.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
