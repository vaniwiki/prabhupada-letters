My dear Bhaiji Hanuman Prasad Poddar,

Please accept my humble obeisances. I beg to acknowledge receipt herewith of your letter dated January 26, 1970, addressed to London Temple, now redirected to me with enclosure of the copy of your former letter. I see that your former letter was addressed to me at the old address of Los Angeles Temple which we left two years ago; therefore, your former letter is missing. Anyway, I am very much pleased to get your inquiries about my activities, and within a week I shall prepare everything nicely and send to you.

I was in London from August through December, 1969, and there was our opening ceremony of Deity installation on the 14th December. Then I have come back to the States by the end of December. In the meantime, I beg to thank you very much for your kind interest in my humble service.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Yours in the service of the Lord,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
