My Dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 11th November, 1970* and I have noted the contents carefully. You may be pleased to know our activities are being very much appreciated here in the Bombay area. Already we have over thirty life members. It appears that there is a very good field for our preaching work in Bombay. Also we have got some nice Indian devotees who are fully engaging their energy in Lord Chaitanya's San Kirtan Movement. So although the atmosphere is surcharged with opposing elements in this age of Kali, if we simply have faith in the words of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, "As many towns and villages as there are all over the world, My name will be known," certainly we will come out successful because Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is Krishna Himself and whatever He desires will certainly be done. So, as parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can become instrumental in carrying out the plan of the Lord and be benefited and be beneficial to all others by the progressive march Back to Godhead. So do not feel discouraged but carry on with perseverance and Krishna will help you.

Hayagriva has written one letter expressing his desire for you to return to New Vrindaban as he is feeling your separation. So if you like, you may return there. Please ask Ramananda to write me about the activities in Gorakhpur.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
