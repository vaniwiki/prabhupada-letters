My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1 March, 1970, in which you have given your recommendation that Mr. Nico Kuyt be initiated by me. So in accordance with your recommendation, I have accepted him as my bona fide disciple, and I am returning his beads herewith duly chanted.

I am glad to learn how the students are friendly toward the devotees although they are generally depressed and rebellious. So Krsna Consciousness is so nice that it can pacify even the most rebellious person because it appeals to the soul.

Regarding your questions; yes, Ramadevi is the sandhini attribute of cit-sakti because her function is for creation, and the jivas are members of the samvit attribute of cit-sakti. The demigods are included within the species of human life. Most of the Spiritual Masters are situated in Madhurya rasa, but not all of them.

I am very glad to learn that Nityananda Das (Nico Kuyt) is currently leading your Sankirtana. Please keep him nicely advancing in Krsna Consciousness under your guidance, and help him to learn our philosophy very well.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
