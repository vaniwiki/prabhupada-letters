====== Letter to: Trivikrama ======

San Francisco

My dear Trivikrama Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 8, 1976.

Regarding having Parivrajakacarya go to Asia to preach, yes, I agree. It is all right.

Satadhanya will be required to stay in India after the festival.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
