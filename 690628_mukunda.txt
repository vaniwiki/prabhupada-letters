====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your several letters; two dated June 19th, one dated June 25th, and one dated June 26th. I am also in due receipt of Syamasundara's letter dated June 26, 1969, and I am very much glad to note the contents of all these letters. Your explanation regarding my P.S. is very much engladdening to me, and I am so proud of having beautiful disciples like you who understand the inner meaning of my mission. Actually, I want the people of the whole world to come to God consciousness and be happy. Without God, there is no question of happiness, and without God, there are no good qualities in a person. So the leaders of the human society are missing this point, and here is a program of Krishna Consciousness that if sober and truthful men join, certainly we shall be able to give something very sublime to the suffering peoples of the world. As requested by you, I am sending herewith a note addressed to the Archbishop, and you may do the needful.

I am so glad to learn that the lease agreement is already signed, and I shall be glad to hear from you further in this connection. I thank you so much for your hard labor in pushing on this Krishna Consciousness Movement, and surely Krishna will give you more and more strength in this endeavor. Sudama has left Hawaii already, and he is here in Los Angeles. He will not go to London until you are completely equipped to receive other brahmacaris from here.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have already sent the design of the altar and throne to Syamasundara. Please do it accordingly.

__ABOUT ISKCON MEDIA.__

I don't wish that Dinesh will interfere with the recording of __"Hare Krishna"__ by the Beatles. I don't know what correspondence is going on with you between Dinesh & you. Everything should be carefully done so that our friendship with the Beatles may not be disturbed. They are gradually coming to cooperate and we shall not do anything which may disturb this cooperation.
