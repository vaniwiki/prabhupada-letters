====== Letter to: Yasomatinandana ======

Evanston, Illinois

My dear Yasomatinandana Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1973 and have noted the contents. So far your arranging to bring other men with you to India for opening a center, that is all right, but if they come as tourists and then go away that is not good. This kind of coming and going is a waste of money. Karandhara can arrange at least one year visa. In that way if you can bring some men here then it will be helpful. But, I think you can get local men here. That is the preaching process.

Yes, you can have the gayatri mantra, when I am coming to Los Angeles.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
