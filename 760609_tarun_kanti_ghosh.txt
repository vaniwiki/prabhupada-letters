My dear Tarun Kanti dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your guru-daksina.

Concerning the initiation of your wife, Revatinandan Swami has approved her being recommended for first initiation, and he has been informed accordingly of her spiritual name. As disciples you must strictly chant 16 rounds of japa, Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, daily. Also strictly avoid the unwanted habits of illicit sex-life, meat-eating, gambling, and intoxication, and in this way make progress in Krishna Consciousness and be happy.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
