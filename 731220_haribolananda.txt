Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Hari Bol Ananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 13, 1973. Yes, we want to develop our land there and Bhaktivedanta Manor very nicely with cows and gardens. So after discussing the matter fully with Madhavananda and Mukunda you make a practical plan for doing this, simultaneously carrying on the Sankirtana program and book distribution. Kindly keep me informed of the progress there.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
