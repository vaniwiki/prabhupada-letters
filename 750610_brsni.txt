My dear Brsni dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. I shall be very glad if you come and visit me in Honolulu at our temple at 51 Coelho Way. When you come to see me, we can talk over all these things. I shall be leaving Honolulu for L.A. on June 20th, 1975.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
