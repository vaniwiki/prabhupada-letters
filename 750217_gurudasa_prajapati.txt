My dear Guru das and Prajapati,

Please accept my blessings. Regarding the dance troupe, I request you to prepare 7 different dances (a new one each day) from the Caitanya Caritamrta for displaying and performing during the Mayapur festival. Also, I request you to prepare 7 different dances from the Krishna book for performing during the Vrndavana festival. When you come to India, I shall also give you some personal direction concerning these dance performances. There are so many nice stories that can be performed. We can have a party of about 15 persons who can go all over and perform these dances. It will be very attractive, if nicely done and people will be inclined to buy books and even buy tickets to see such a performance. In this way all the expenses of going from one place to another will be covered. So, organize this program nicely and it will be a great success.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
