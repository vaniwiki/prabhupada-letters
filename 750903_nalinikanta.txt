My dear Nalinikanta das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 8, 1975 with enclosed check for U.S. 50.00. I have noted the contents of your letter. You have been married for a year and a half but do not have any desire for children. Then why did you marry? That is my question. If you do not want children, then why did you marry? You should not take sannyasa.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
