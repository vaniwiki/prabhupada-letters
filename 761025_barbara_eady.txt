My dear Barbara Eady,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter undated.

I am very glad to hear that you are very serious about Krsna Consciousness and are chanting 16 rounds, following the regulative principles and trying to distribute my books in New Zealand. I will be pleased to accept you as my initiated disciple, but I must have some recommendation. If you will have Tusta Krsna write to me recommending you then I will gladly do so.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
