My dear Gurukrpa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 30 March, 1977.

Yes, yesterday Bank of America has received your transfer of $100,000. May you live long and serve Krsna.

As you have suggested I am instructing Bharadraja to immediately make a new set of Panca-tattva Deities for our Hawaii temple.

Now that our Bombay temple is nearing completion you must begin to construct a nice temple at the birthplace of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Mayapur dham. I think in Japan there are some of the best architectural construction firms in the world. If it is possible kindly find out the best architect in Japan. Describe generally our Mayapur temple project and for more details have him write to Surabhi Swami, c/o Hare Krishna Land, Bombay.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
