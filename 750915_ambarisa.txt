My dear Ambarisa das:

Please accept my blessings. The land at Kuruksetra is now available to us. So you can come and join me. If you meet me in Nairobi at about the third week of October, then we can come to India together.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
