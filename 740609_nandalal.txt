====== Letter to: Nandalal ======

Honolulu

My dear Nandalal,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 23, just received here in Paris.

It is good news that you are finding engagement in distributing my books all day in Hawaii. So there is no question of taking other engagement; distribution of my books is the highest kind of preaching, and thus the best engagement. So take it as Krsna's mercy that you have come to Hawaii and engage there full time as it is a very important place.

Regarding your deity. So long as you are not living separately, you may put your deity on the regular temple altar, and as they are caring for the deity and feeding and dressing and cleansing, so the temple pujari may also give your deity the proper care and worship.

The explanation given by Ramesvara that sankirtana is Lord Caitanya's lila, which he compares to the gopies trying to engage others in Krsna's service, is the correct understanding.

Please inform Sudama Maharaja that I have received his May 27th letter and that I am encouraged by the progress of the farm as well as the continued book distribution. I have asked Yasodanandana Swami to help out in Taiwan where there are only two men, rather than come to Hawaii. By now Sudama Maharaja should have been informed by Bali Mardan that myself and my two secretaries will be stopping off in Hawaii on our journey from Australia to the U.S. and that we will arrive July 3rd on Quantas airlines at 8:45 A.M.. We will stay for 30 hours and he should arrange for our staying in Honolulu. More when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
