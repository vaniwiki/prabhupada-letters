My dear Malati devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated Jan. 27, 1975 and have noted the contents. It is good that you have gone to Amsterdam temple to help with the deity program there. It must be done very nicely. So, help train them up to worship Radha and Krishna very nicely.

Thank you for also sending Syamasundara's new address.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
