Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I have not received any report from you. I gave you 1 1/2 lakhs of Rupees, and I want to know what you have done with it. How have you spent it, and what is the progress.

Gargamuni Swami is collecting for Mayapur. Is he sending you any money? How is the money being utilized?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
