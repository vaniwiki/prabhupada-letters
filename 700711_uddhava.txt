My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 6th July, 1970, along with the blueprint copy of the __Lord in the Heart.__ Thank you very much.

It is alright to go ahead with the printing of this second chapter. I have approved all the questionable points noted by Pradyumna, so it is alright.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
