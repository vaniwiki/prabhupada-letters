My dear Krishna devi,

Please accept my blessings. I was very glad to receive your letter dated Oct. 20. I can understand your anxiety about your husband & rest assured that I shall never advise your husband to leave you. Both of you are very good souls & constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. One who has got a helpful wife at home does not require to accept Sannyas. If required, both you and your husband can preach Krishna Consciousness combinedly. We are concerned more for Krishna Consciousness & if that work is executed more nicely by cooperation of husband & wife, there is no necessity of thinking wife as impediment to Krishna Consciousness. While I am living you should act according to my instructions & there is no question of impediment. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
