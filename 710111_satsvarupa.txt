My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your several letters and ISKCON Press Newsletters dated 13, 16 and 27th December, 1970, and noted the contents. I have been travelling considerably and the preaching work is taking up all of our time; so our tour in India is very much welcomed by the people, but I have not the opportunity to write my correspondence very often.

I am hoping that the Bhagavad-gita As It Is and Nectar of Devotion shall be printed soon. If you require the funds for NOD and TLC, I shall send it conveniently. But I have just received a letter from Karandhara that the needed money is already arranged and the printing should begin soon. I am very anxious to see that ISKCON Press is operating effectively. Regarding the Preface to Bhagavad-gita, I shall send that as soon as I have got some time to write one. In the meantime you can go ahead with the remainder of layout work.

It is very good news that Advaita is back with you. Please see that he is given all facilities to operate the press to fullest advantage. Kulasekhara should be a great assistance also in this connection; but Advaita is expert.

Regarding funds for ISKCON Press, this has been very much mismanaged in the past, so now you are suffering. The right thing is that the temples have got to pay the book bills to ISKCON Press very promptly. We have got so many literatures and therefore it is not very good that there is a shortage of money realized from their distribution.

I am still awaiting the shipment of books to India. Please let me know if they are dispatched or not.

I hear from all our centers that they have instituted regular classes for writing articles and still you say they do not contribute sufficiently to Back to Godhead. How is that? I want all our students to write articles for our transcendental magazine. That is practical. Karandhara has also written that my long desired scheme of a Krsna Conscious daily newspaper is being implemented. Please do this work very nicely. It will be a very great step in the history of ISKCON movement.

Regarding your proposal to approach important persons to help us in this work, I am sorry to note a consideration of some false "Trust Fund." Such false things have no value either for us or anyone else.

I am awaiting your next letters of progress and newsletters also. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. What action you have taken on the Mayavadi Sannyasi?
