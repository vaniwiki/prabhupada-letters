====== Letter to: Caru Gupta ======

Auckland

My dear Caru Gupta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 29 January 1976 addresses to Bombay and forwarded here.

Regarding the restaurant, I would like to know how it is running on? Please send a description. How many people are responding? Send all the details.

By your next letter I shall give my decision concerning your initiations. You are already worshiping Gaura Nitai so that is all right. And your wife is assisting you, so that is also all right.

So you wait for a while for initiation and if possible come to India to Mayapur and I shall initiate you.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. The name Mrnalini means lotus.
