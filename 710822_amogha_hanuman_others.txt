My dear Amogha, Hanuman, etc.

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram telling of $50.00 donation sent to L.A. But that sum has now been sent to London instead and I have duly received it here. Thank you very much for the same.

I understand from Bali Mardan that there in Kuala Lumpur Kamal Devi is making so many demands and is not willing to construct the temple there according to our standard. So if the situation is not good there then you can have a touring program of preaching and distributing our literatures. That will be very nice. Of course in the big cities a big temple is required but if that is not possible then continue with your preaching program with full enthusiasm and determination.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
