My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14th May, 1970, and noted the contents.

I am very glad to learn that you have decided to live in Sydney. Sydney is your jurisdiction, so you cannot leave this place unless there is very urgent engagement in other place. You have got to organize this center very nicely and Krsna has sent you already some help in the shape of a nice actress who is willing to help us in any way. Please try to convince this girl about our Krsna philosophy. You are already experienced and sincere worker, if you try to convince her, Krsna will help you from within. Our Isopanisad book will be easy for anyone to understand about God-consciousness, then there are other small books like Three Essays, Krsna Consciousness: the Topmost Yoga System, Easy Journey to Other Planets, etc., so let her read all these things.

So as you have no resort than myself, so I have no other disciple than yourself who can take care of organizing Sydney center. Please do therefore everything with enthusiasm. That will satisfy me, and Krsna also, and as a result of which you will be satisfied transcendentally---this is our position.

While posting this letter I have received your letter dated 22nd May, 1970, and I am so very much pleased to know that everything has been resolved so nicely, and Sydney center has moved to a larger and better location. All these are very good news, and I beg to thank you very much.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
