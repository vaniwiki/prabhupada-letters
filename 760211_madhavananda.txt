My dear Madhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 2, 1976, and I have noted the contents. I am very pleased to see that you are distributing 40-60 books daily. Please go on doing this; it is very good. Tripurari Maharaja is well advanced in this art and your intelligence combined will produce a good effect. Please stick to this engagement, and in that way you will be successful.

In India we haven't established a very strong distribution, but I want to organize sales here. Please consider this, and if you have any suggestions how to do it, please give them to me.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Kausalya is there in Bombay. She cooked for me for a few days.\\
