My dear Nandarani,

Please accept my blessings. I was very pleased to receive your letter. I have come to Navadvipa since I've received your letter, the birthplace of Lord Caitanya. We came here last Tuesday & probably I shall return to Calcutta early next week.

Regarding the Teachings in the temple; everyone of my disciples may become a teacher strictly following my instructions. I am a bona fide teacher as long as I follow the instructions of my spiritual master. That is the only one qualification for becoming a teacher. As soon as one deviates from this principle one is no longer a teacher. I do not know how Subala das speaks but if there is any deviation you can point it out & adjust things between yourselves. Personally I know both yourself & your husband, Dayananda, are very sincere souls & I am much obliged to you because you have opened a nice center in L.A. Similarly, Subala das also opened a center at Santa Fe. All this activity is very encouraging to my mission & I believe sincerely that you are doing the best to serve the cause of ISKCON.

I have already arranged for going back to your country & I have secured a visitors visa & the passage money is also deposited with the travel agent, so the only thing is that Mukunda is trying to get my permanent visa & I am waiting for his final word in this connection. I thank you very much for your proposal that I shall stay at L.A. & you will arrange for all my comforts. I am looking forward for the opportunity. From India I shall first go to San Francisco & then to your place. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
