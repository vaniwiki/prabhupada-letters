My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find tape no. 2 from L.A., 4th Canto, 8th chapter. Kindly acknowledge date of receipt.

I hope that by now you have got the throne, etc. all ready for installation ceremony. By the middle of July I shall be going to N.Y. and at that time you can send us tickets for going to Boston also. We are three; Syamasundara (Samuel Speerstra); Aravinda (Arthur J. Friedman), and myself. From Boston I shall go to New Vrindaban, come again to N.Y. and then go to London. So please arrange for Kirtanananda Swami to send tickets, round trip, to Pittsburgh.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
