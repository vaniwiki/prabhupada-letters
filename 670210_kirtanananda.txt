My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of 7th (March) February 1967 and I am very glad to learn that you are improving your department very nicely. I learn also that you made the new __kachori__ according to my direction and it has come out very successful. I have taught two more things to Ranchor namely "Nan khatai" and "Peda" which you have to learn from him by succession. Srimati Jadurani writes "many of Swami Satcitananda's disciples were present in the last Sunday's feasting and returned this morning to Kirtana. __Our traps are too strong to resist.__" I think you will agree with her. I am glad to learn that the film taken by Mr. Richard Witty has come out very successful. It is all Krishna's blessings. I think we may purchase one copy of the film at some concessional rate from Mr. Witty.

Regarding the house I was correct in my remarks that there was no definite understanding. If Mr. Taylor can change his word of honour transpired between him and Mr. Payne certainly that is not definite understanding. Mr. Taylor's lawyer cannot change the understanding between the two gentleman, he can simply give a legal shape only. Therefore, in such negotiations everything is done in black and white. Nothing is being done in black and white but everything is being done with faith on Mr. Payne.

Now forget what has been done in the past. Do it now businesslike. Mr. Taylor's lawyer has agreed to accept $105,000 cash for the house "as is" and Mr. Payne has agreed to pay the same secured from Pittsburgh. Let this understanding be completed within 1st of March 1967 and close the chapter. I think this is my last word in this connection. You are all grown up boys and you use your discretion and you can now complete the transaction without prolonging it indefinitely. If, however, we are not able to purchase a house it does not mean closing our activity at 26 Second avenue. So there is no question of packing up and come to S.F.

Regarding your editing, I would very much like it. I am sending my lecture copies to you. I think my other copies are lying on the left side of my seat in a cardboard box which please find out. Please be careful not to change the ideas.
