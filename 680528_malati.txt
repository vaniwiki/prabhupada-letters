My dear Malati,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of May 14, 1968, and I have noted your kind sentiments with appreciation. Don't wait for next life for finishing up the business of Krishna Consciousness; try to finish up this business in this life. And pray to Krishna that if your Krishna Consciousness business is unfinished in this life, He may give you chance to take birth in a family where the father and mother are in Krishna Consciousness. That is a great opportunity. Similarly, the child who is coming in your family is supposed to have executed Krishna Consciousness in his previous life. I have not heard from your husband in many days. After your childbirth, does he propose to go to Germany for preaching work? We want to establish one center in Germany. As my permanent visa in USA has not been granted, so I am going to Montreal for some time, then after my business in Montreal is finished, I may go to London, and then to Germany. That is my desire. I do not know what is Krishna's desire. We can discuss this further at that time.

In the absolute world there is no distinction as me, or he, and I. Krishna and His representative is the same. Just like Krishna can be present simultaneously in millions of places. Similarly, the Spiritual Master also can be present wherever the disciple wants. A Spiritual Master is the principle, not the body. Just like a television can be seen in thousands of places by the principle of relay monitoring.

This seeing of "spirits" has no connection with Krishna Consciousness---it is hallucination.

Yes, so far your coming child is concerned, I shall give name to it when it is born. No, circumcision is not done in Vedic culture, it is not required.

Yes, to make a Krishna Consciousness coloring book for children is a very good idea for serving and for spreading Krishna Consciousness to the young children. Please do it. I will give you hints how to do it; just let me know when you are ready to begin. It will be a great service.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
