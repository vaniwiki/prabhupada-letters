====== Letter to: Jamadagni ======

Honolulu

My dear Jamadagni das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated May 15, 1976, and I have gladly noted the contents.

Our aims and objects in the Krishna Consciousness Movement are very sublime. Kindly follow and you'll be happy and I'll be happy.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
