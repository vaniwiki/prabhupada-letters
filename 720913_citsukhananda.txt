====== Letter to: Citsukhananda ======

Mexico City

My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter from Mexico City dated September 8, 1972, and have noted the contents. I would have liked to go to Mexico City but I have already gone this year and too much traveling now for me is a strain. Therefore I am going directly from Los Angeles to India, but when I return next year then I shall certainly come again to Mexico and visit all of my nice disciples there.

Regarding the new altar, Sri Guru and Gauranga altar would be appropriate. If you are able to make that show in the theater for the public of our __kirtana__ and __aratrika,__ etc., that will be very very nice. And I am very much pleased to hear that you have purchased some land for __asrama__ and that you will be having cows there on six acres. I shall be anxious to see that place when I come back from India.

Meanwhile, hoping this meets you all in best of health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
