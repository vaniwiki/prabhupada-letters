My dear daughter Nirmala,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 11-3-76 and it is very nice how you are appreciating. It is also nice that you are caring for the devotees. They have left everything for me, so they should be treated as sons and daughters.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

My regards for your good mother-in-law
