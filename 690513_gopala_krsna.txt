My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated May 6th, 1969 and May 9th, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I think that since you are willing to observe the four principal rules of spiritual life, you may be initiated by me as soon as you like. The other rules you should try to follow as far as possible, but according to circumstances they may be adjusted if necessary. But the four rules must be maintained. Regarding your idea of marrying one Krishna Conscious girl and then going to India, that will depend upon the desire of your wife. I cannot interfere with that. But generally the wife is meant to follow wherever the husband goes. Most likely your wife would agree with you---she will not disagree to go. Rather, some girls will be very much encouraged to go to India with her husband. So you may consider on these points and inform me what you have decided.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
