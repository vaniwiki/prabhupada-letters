My dear Kirtiraja Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of you letter dated November 17, 1975. Due to traveling I have not received it till just now, but in the meantime I have learned from Hansadutta Prabhu that you have already arrived in Germany. So you work with Cakravarti and Alanatha Prabhu, they will give you good advice and help.

I am very happy that you are taking a chance for Krishna, do everything very carefully and sincerely, Krishna will help you. Lord Caitanya predicted that in the modern age this movement would be spread to every town and village of the world. So by the sincere help of you American and European boys and girls it is actually happening. It is not bogus, like communism, socialism and so many isms going on in the world today. But is purely spiritual authorized by the disciplic succession tracing all the way back to Krishna himself who spoke this science of life 5,000 years ago on the battlefield of Kuruksetra. The battlefield is still there and you will be happy to know that yesterday we have been at that very spot where Krishna spoke to Arjuna, and we will build a gorgeous Krishna Arjuna temple there. People will come from all over the world to see it and understand the authority and sublime message of Lord Krishna.

Please keep me informed how you are progressing with your mission. I hope this letter finds you and your good wife well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
