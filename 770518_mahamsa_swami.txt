My dear Mahamsa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated May 8th, 1977. I was very surprised to know that you did not receive my letter dated the 13th April, 1977. Enclosed please find a copy of that letter.

You have written to say, "As soon as the temple is completed, the prasadam distribution and evening public program will begin." Why the building is required for prasadam distribution and kirtan? These can go on in any circumstances. From the very beginning I have been insisting on this program, but you say that it will only begin in the future. Prasadam distribution must always go on. Now whatever money I have sent you, spend for prasadam distribution. If necessary you may suspend the building, but distribution of prasadam and kirtan should be stressed above all. In Mayapur simply because of this program we have become famous. There twice a week they are serving thousands of villagers, so you should also do the same at least two times a week. The best thing is that the villagers should come to our land, chant Hare Krsna and take prasadam there. When there is prasadam distribution and kirtan it means there is already a temple.

Yes, it is alright if you use the secretary's room as a special guest room.

If you are able to keep to the planting schedule that you have outlined it will be a great accomplishment. In these and other matters you should take the advice and help of Hari Prasad Badruka. I have already written him in this regard, but I have not yet got a reply from him.

Please let me know as soon as you have the registered documents in your hands.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
