My dear Hitsaranji,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated 24 January, 1970. I have written one letter to Srimati Sumati Morarji of the Scindia Steam Navigation Company, and the copy of the letter addressed to her is enclosed herewith for reference.

If some of your men or the shipping agents' men will see her in Bombay (because I think the packages will be shipped via Bombay) then I am sure she will sanction free carriage of the packages. But I may instruct you, if somehow or other this Scindia Steam Navigation Company delays the matter, you may advise your shipping agents to dispatch without delay. We will pay the shipping charges here if your Trust is legally unable to bear the cost of sending the Murtis to America.

Formerly, you informed me in your letter that the Birla Trust will bear the cost of carriage also for the four pairs of Murtis which they have donated. So if they can bear the cost of shipping, why your Trust will be legally unable to do so? Anyway, my open advice is to you that if Scindia Steam Navigation Company does not agree, then you can ship the Murtis for being carried to the following destinations at my cost. You will simply send me the shipping documents to the following addresses and we will arrange to clear them.

Shipping instructions:

1) 1 pair of Murtis

ISKCON Temple

38 Beacon Street

Boston, Massachusetts 02134 U.S.A.\\
2) 1 pair of Murtis to

ISKCON Temple

3720 Park Avenue

Montreal 18, Quebec

Canada\\
3) 3 pairs of Murtis to

ISKCON Temple

1975 South La Cienega Blvd.

Los Angeles, 90034 California U.S.A.

I hope this dispatch process will clear the whole thing and you will kindly do the needful as early as possible.

At least may I request you to add with each pair of Murtis, japa malas (big beads for chanting) 100 pairs with each pair of Murtis.

Please offer my regards to Seth Jaya Dayalaji Dalmia. I know that you are always very busy, but still I shall request you as my beloved child to reply my letter at your earliest convenience. Thanking you in anticipation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. You will be pleased to know that our next attempt will be to open our center in Sydney, Australia. We have already opened in Tokyo, Japan. The address is as follows:

ISKCON Temple

6-16, 1-chome, ohhashi

Meguru-ku

Tokyo, Japan\\
So we require many pairs of Deities. Already 24 centers are there, and the next attempt will be in Berlin, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, etc.\\
