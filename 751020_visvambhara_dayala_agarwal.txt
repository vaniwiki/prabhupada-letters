Sriman Visvambhara Dayala Agarwal,\\
Vrndavana

My dear bhaktaji,

Please accept my blessings. Since I have left India I have received no report from Vrindaban, how things are going on. I am very much anxious to know. Kindly immediately on receipt of this letter send me a report especially touching on the following points:

1. Whether the Gurukula land is purchased by this time.

2. Whether Kasiramji has given the front land legally.

3. Whether temple management is going on without any loss of money.\\
Herewith please find one letter for Digambhar Singh Chowdhury your friend. The letter speaks for itself, as you will see, and now we have to hold meetings for organizing the Krsan community, better the Vaisya community, for producing food and milk. I have given the idea, now you have to organize it properly.

I hope that this will meet you in good health, and please reply this letter along with Digambar Singh Chowdbury's reply to Bombay address where I am returning by the end of this month. Please offer my blessings to all your friends, especially Sethji Bisanchand and Kasiramji.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
