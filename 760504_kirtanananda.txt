New Vrindaban

My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 25, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning the construction of a new temple for Sri Sri Radha Vrindaban Candra, our men can see how the Indian mistris are doing the work there, and they can learn the art. During the construction, the Deities can be moved to some temporary place. The worship must continue, it doesn't matter if the Deities are moved.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
