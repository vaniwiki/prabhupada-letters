My dear Tripurari,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of April 7, 1974 with the astounding figures of book distribution in one day at the Chicago Airport.

You are one of the successful pillars of our Krsna Consciousness movement. The more we distribute books and literature the more we become understood by the people about our mission, and the more they understand our mission they become advanced on the path of liberation from all problems of life. My thanks to all of you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
