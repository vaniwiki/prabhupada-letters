My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8/11/70, and I have noted its contents with great hope and enthusiasm. Under the expert leadership of such sincere students as yourself and Rupanuga and Karandhara in the U.S. the GBC is taking on the responsibility that I desired. Similarly in Europe Syamasundara is working hard. So by Krishna's Grace everything is taking shape. Here in India also the work is pushing forward, and daily we are getting reports of support among the influential members of the community. Half of our devotees have just opened up another center on the other side of Calcutta, and last night there were more than 200 persons singing and dancing at our place.

So I can see that there is very good potency at the present moment for spreading this movement as was desired by my Guru Maharaja, and I am simply trying my best to carry out His desire. And if some of my students adopt this attitude, without any other motivation, surely Krishna will fulfill our desire. So push on with book publication and distribution, and I am very glad that you are now distributing to schools and libraries. Yes, Sri Brahma Samhita may also be printed.

It is very encouraging that Krishna has given you a nice new building. That is the way---the more we do for Krishna the more facility He gives us. Please send me some slide pictures of this and any other activities you have got as everywhere we go we show a nice slide show, and it is always greatly appreciated, together with kirtana.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
