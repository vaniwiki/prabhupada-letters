My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your recommendation for initiation of Michael Kaplan, and I have duly chanted upon his beads. Please encourage him in the matter of understanding Krishna Consciousness and avoiding the ten kinds of offenses and following the regulative principles. I have written one letter Mssrs. Atma Ram and Sons in Delhi regarding selling our books, along with other proposals. He has written about the books as follows: "I contacted the local representative of MacMillan & Co. regarding __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ They have not heard anything about it and have showed complete ignorance. Moreover, in the catalog which they possess, your book has not been mentioned. I am certainly interested in the sale of this book and would like to know your terms and conditions for the same." I do not know why MacMillan Company has not mentioned about our book in their Indian catalog. Anyway, he is interested to sell our books because it is written by me, so you do the needful. Ask Mr. Wade why their representative is ignorant of this publication. This Atma Ram and Sons was selling my __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ at 40% discount. So you should open correspondence with them, giving reference to their letter #IKP, dated May 2, 1969, and signed by Ish Kumar Puri, Manager. Also send them one dust cover of __TLC,__ and offer them the same commission so that they may, forward order to you, and you can supply them. Also inquire from them if they are interested in being the sole selling agency in India. In this case, they must purchase at least 500 books. If not, they can help us by sending a list of leading book sellers in India who can help in selling our books. Upon receipt of such list, you can open correspondence with these booksellers. Previous to this I wrote you that when you come to bring my tape recorder, but I don't think there is necessity now because here Hayagriva has got a tape recorder which can be used when I wish to make copies.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
