My dear Rasarani devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your note and your offering. Always remain engaged in the service of Krishna. That is the sure and safe method to be safe from the grip of Maya. Maya will never touch you if you are cent percent serving Krishna. Follow the rules carefully, chant at least 16 rounds, read and study my books deeply, and in this way be enthusiastic about going back to Godhead in this life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
