My dear Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. While I was leaving London you gave me your letters and flowers also and I was very much pleased. So now you are in the line of Krishna Consciousness; you know all the regulative principles. Please strictly follow them and chant 16 rounds regularly. And try to serve the Deity as far as possible; cleanse the temple, etc. and Krishna will be very much pleased upon you.

Even there are some inconveniences, please try and tolerate. If in this one life I try and become a little tolerant, humble and meek and chant Mahamantra regularly, keeping clean externally and internally, there will be tremendous spiritual benefit and all the problems of life will be solved. Our material life is a contaminated life. Therefore the above mentioned procedures must be adopted to purify our existence. That is the main duty of this human form of life.

The only difficulty we may feel especially young boys and girls, is an urge of sex impulse, but if we tolerate it a little patiently we avoid so many troubles of life. I am sure you are both very intelligent girls and you will follow my instruction and try to follow strictly.

Hoping this will meet you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
