Dear Radha Sarana dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 16, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

On your recommendation I am accepting the following for first and second initiation:

__First Initiation__:

Bhakta Carlos---Karunamaya dasa

Bhakta Lalo---Lalitagovinda dasa

Bhakta Jonathan---Jyotsna dasa

Bhakta Willo---Visvadeva dasa

__Second Initiation__:

Minaksi dasa Brahmacari

Hold a fire sacrifice and the initiates should refrain from the four pillars of sinful life: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, and no meat-eating. This is very easy when one chants daily their prescribed rounds seriously, at least 16 rounds daily. Enclosed you will also find one brahmana thread and gayatri mantra. After the sacrifice the tape of gayatri should be played in the right ear of the brahmana initiate. To become brahmana one must be clean outside and inside. Outside by regularly bathing and inside by always chanting Hare Krishna. The beads for first initiates can be chanted upon by Hrdayananda Maharaja and they should be given these beads and names at the time of initiation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
