====== Letter to: Rajamohan (Kelly Cristoph), Gauramohan (Rodney Purcell), Kumkum (Kathy) ======

Dallas

My dear Sons and Daughter,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Mohanananda Prabhu I have gladly consented to accept you three as my duly initiated disciples. Also I have received your check as daksina for $75. Thank you very much for the same. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are enclosed herewith. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

(Kelly Cristoph)---__Rajamohan Das Brahmacari.__ Rajamohan means Krishna, the one who captivates even the king.

(Rodney Purcell)---__Gauramohan Das Brahmacari.__ Gauramohan means the attractive feature of Gauradesa, or Bengal; that is Lord Caitanya.

(Kathy Prabhu)---__Kumkum Devi Dasi.__ Kumkum is the red powder which is used extensively by the gopis and Krishna.

I am so glad to learn that you all have been such a great help to Mohanananda Prabhu there in our Dallas center. I can understand that you are all very sincere boys and girls and are very eligible candidates for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health, and working hard to make our ISAVASYA school a grand success.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
