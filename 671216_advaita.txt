====== Letter to: Advaita ======

My dear Advaita das

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 20, 1967.

Yes, you can marry but wait until my arrival in N.Y. very soon. I have very much enjoyed your appreciation of my humble service to Krishna.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
