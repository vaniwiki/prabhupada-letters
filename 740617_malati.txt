My dear Malati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of June 15, 1974.

I can understand by what you have written that you are advancing in Krsna Consciousness. By your unalloyed service to the Deities you are becoming more and more attracted to the spiritual world and seeing the material world as a condemned place of no happiness. So our business as Vaisnavas is to increase our natural attraction to Krsna and try to tell others about this great hopefulness to human life.

So please go on as you are doing. Your husband is struggling to make his business successful, so let us hope he comes out a grand success.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
