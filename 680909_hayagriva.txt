My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. And I hope by this time you have reached your headquarters, at Wheeling, and I hope you are feeling well. And you have taken the dictaphone. Now immediate task is that you revise the 1st, 2nd, 3rd volumes of Srimad-Bhagavatam. As soon as they are revised, we shall immediately print in one volume. Just we are going to print, volume one means canto one. So then you take up the second part, second canto, and keep along with you Pradyumna; he will help you in marking diacritic signs on the original verses, and be always in correspondence with me. And be seriously engaged in this task, and it will be a great service to Krishna. And try to finish the last act of Caitanya Caritamrta also.

So far your opening a center, in the Columbus University, that is also very nice idea. The three days you will be there must be utilized in propagating our Krishna Consciousness amongst the students, and I think in charge of that center, Pradyumna may be left so that when you are there, he will work with you. And when you are not there, he will take care of the center. I think you will like this idea. In this way, Kirtanananda may develop New Vrindaban. He will have a nice assistant, Vamanadeva, and Hrsikesa, and I think everything will come out very successful without delay. Krishna is giving you intelligence and bestowing His Mercy upon you; continue this attitude, whenever you feel some difficulty, chant Hare Krishna. Pray to Krishna to help you, and there will be no difficulty. Be rest assured. I hope this will find you in good health and cheerfulness.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
