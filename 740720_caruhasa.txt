My dear Caruhasa das;

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter undated and also seen the picture book. You should know it that Krsna is not a plaything. These things should strictly not be done.* If you do this, then Krsna will become a fairy tale. Please drop this matter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
