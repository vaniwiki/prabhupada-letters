__MEMO TO ALL ISKCON TEMPLE PRESIDENTS:__

On April 6, 1972, the following message was dispatched by cable, one copy each to Karandhara, Rupanuga, and Hansadutta:

YOUR MATERIAL LEGAL FORMULA WILL NOT HELP US. ONLY OUR SPIRITUAL LIFE CAN HELP US. HAMSADUTA MUST RETURN GERMANY IMMEDIATELY AND DON'T LEAVE AGAIN. ATREYA RISHI HAS NO AUTHORITY FROM ME TO MANAGE ANYTHING. REMOVE HIM. I HAVE NO APPROVAL FOR ANY THESE PLANS. DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. ACKNOWLEDGE CABLE 26 RENNY STREET PADDINGTON SYDNEY.

BHAKTIVEDANTA SWAMI

On the following morning, April 7, 1972, three replies were received:

1. JAI! ALL MY MISGIVINGS CONFIRMED BY YOUR TELEGRAMS. RAISED STRONG OBJECTIONS AT GBC MEETINGS. LETTER SENT TO YOU ON 30TH ABOUT THIS. DETAILS TO FOLLOW. HAMSADUTA LEFT 30TH FOR GERMANY. ATREYA RISHI NOTIFIED. GBC NOTIFIED. NOTHING SIGNIFICANT CHANGED YET. DO NOT WORRY. HARE KRISHNA.

RUPANUGA.

2. I WILL REMAIN IN GERMANY AND FOLLOW YOUR INSTRUCTION. WILL REMOVE ATREYA RISHI.

HAMSADUTA.

3. HAMSADUTA HAS RETURNED TO GERMANY. ATREYA REMOVED. AWAITING ANY FURTHER INSTRUCTION.

KARANDHARA.
