====== Letter to: Niranjana ======

Varanasi

My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 11, 1972, from Allahabad, and I have noted the contents with care. Of course I excuse my disciples always, but they should not take advantage of it. But whatever is done, is done. Now let us see what positive contribution we can produce for pushing on the message of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu all over the world. If you are serious to be an important assistant in our Society you should fully engage yourself in translation work, and do not mix yourself with my so-called god-brothers. As there are in Vrindaban some residents like monkeys and hogs, similarly there are many rascals in the name of Vaisnavas, be careful of them. And do not dare to question imprudently before your Spiritual Master. Further talks we may discuss when we meet. I shall remain here up to December 1st, then I am going to Ahmedabad and then to Bombay by last week of December.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
