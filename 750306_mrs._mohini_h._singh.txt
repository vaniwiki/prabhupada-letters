My dear Mrs. Singh,

Please accept the blessings of Lord Krishna. I thank you for your kind letter of invitation dated 21st of Feb., 1975. I am just on my way to London from here (New York), and from there I shall have to go to Tehran, Iran, and then back to India by the 15th of March, 1975 for arranging the birthday anniversary of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu at our Mayapur center, (District Nadia), West Bengal, India. Therefore I am very sorry to inform you that I shall not be able to attend the auspicious meeting which you are going to hold on the 23rd of March. I am advising therefore my senior disciple, His Holiness, Kirtanananda Swami to attend the meeting and I hope he will be able to present the proper view of our Krishna Consciousness movement. Our movement is completely a spiritual movement, therefore sometimes it appears to be a little different from the materialistic cultural movement. In the Bhagavad-gita, the spiritual hint is there in the beginning of the lesson to Arjuna. Krishna wanted to pick up the spiritual soul from within the body: __dehino 'smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara__ [[books:bg:2:13|(Bg. 2.13)]]. So, the spirit soul is within the body. Unless we catch up the spirit soul within the body, there is no question of spiritual life or culture. Still, we are trying to push this movement in the western countries and many of them are taking it very seriously. I hope Sriman Kirtanananda Maharaja will be able to convince you further in the meeting and I hope you will give him some time to speak on the subject matter on my behalf. Further in order to convince people more about this movement philosophically and scientifically, we have published up to date about 50 books. So, if you kindly give me a nice booth for demonstration of the books, it will be a great opportunity to introduce our literature amongst the intelligent class of men. Our books are already recognized by the academic section of universities. They are a standard, authorized collection and I hope you will give us proper facilities to utilize the opportunity.

Thanking you once more for your kind invitation.

Yours sincerely,\\
