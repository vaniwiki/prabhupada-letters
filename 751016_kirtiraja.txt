My dear Kirtiraja dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 8, 1975, and I have noted the contents carefully.

As soon as someone is trained then go to preach very nicely in Poland. Try to make some literature in Polish and Russian. Anyone can be trained to execute orders in sending out the books but preaching requires special qualification. So you have this good qualification for preaching and now do it very nicely.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
