My dear Sri D%%------%%ji, [handwriting indistinct]

Please accept my greetings. We are staying at the Magh Mela, at the Prayag pilgrimage. The program here is going on very nicely. It will be a great pleasure for us if you visit and stay with us in this sacred pilgrimage.

We are having daily artik ceremony many times with kirtan, and there is prasadam distribution, Sankirtan, and so many activities. And our pandel is very big, so if you come there is accommodation for staying. We invite you to come here with your family.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
