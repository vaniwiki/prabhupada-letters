====== Letter to: Bhakta Wayne ======

Denver

My dear Bhakta Wayne,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 18, 1976. I have noted the contents.

Temple life means following strictly the regulative principles and chanting a minimum of 16 rounds, or more if possible. The temple must always be kept neat and clean. If the family is not favorable then let them remain separate and you remain in the temple. And, even if you live with your family, where is the difficulty? The same principles must be followed.

As far as music is concerned, we have got our standard of music, the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. We do not require to introduce anything new.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
