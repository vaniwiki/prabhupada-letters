My dear Mr. Setti:

Please accept my blessings. I have received the report from Gargamuni Swami that things are not being managed properly there. I do not know anything about this road. It must be stopped immediately. I am sending Brahmananda and Gargamuni there to sve the situation, and shall be very thankful to you if you help them in every way to stop this road making.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
