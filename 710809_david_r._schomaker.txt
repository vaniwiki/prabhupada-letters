My dear David R. Schomaker,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife Susan. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3rd August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Thank you very much for your kind appreciations of our Krishna Consciousness movement. I am so glad to hear that you have taken to devotional service and are finding it more and more enlivening. Simply if you will go on, following the prohibitive rules of: no meat eating; no intoxication, no illicit sex life and no gamblings and if you will regularly chant 16 rounds of beads daily and try to understand this philosophy by reading our books and referring any questions to the devotees there, then surely you will make rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness. Of that you can be sure. And as far as possible try and associate exclusively with the devotees there. That is strongly recommended for one who is serious to make advancement in spiritual life.

So far naming your child is concerned, you as her parents should give her a suitable name and you can add the prefix bhakta dasi, or servant of the devotee, as are we all. Then when she grows up and takes initiation from a bona fide spiritual master, she may be given a new name at that time.

I am so glad to note that both you, husband and wife, are qualified to teach and are anxious to do so in one of our community situations. That will be very nice. So if you like, you can make suitable arrangements for going either to Texas or to New Vrindaban, where they may have need for such qualified teachers. So correspond with those centers and find out if it is possible.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
