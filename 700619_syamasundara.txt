My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from you since a long time, and I think you are now very busy on account of Rathayatra festival. I hope you are all well with your good wife, Malati, and daughter, Sarasvati. Your good daughter's photograph catching my hand is published in our Handbook of Krsna Consciousness which is to be printed very shortly containing the calendar and important information of our activities.

Brahmananda has gone to Japan to complete the KRSNA book. Everything is going alright. A few copies will be ready by the Rathayatra, and I have advised him to send you 25 copies to begin the sales from Rathayatra auspicious date. The balance books will be ready for dispatch by the 20th of July, 1970. I have decided to send you 2,500 copes for sale. And also I wish to send some free copies to George Harrison for distribution amongst his intimate friends as he likes. So please let me know by return post how many copies will satisfy him. I know that he has many friends, but I will be ready to supply him free copies not exceeding one hundred. So please reply this point immediately.

Recently I have made some songs recorded of course in Bengali. If you so desire, I can send them for George.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
