My dear Hansadutta das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 27, 1974 with enclosure of LICENSE. George should be addressed directly in this matter. It must be explained to him what we want. Don't sign this agreement. We do not recognize Harrisongs. Any agreement must be between George himself or whomever he says. We have taken this house from George not from Harrisongs. Why did Mukunda approach Denis O'Brien? George has his own attorney. What is the position of Denis O'Brien?

Some time ago there was an agreement made regarding the grazing land on the Bhaktivedanta Manor property. So far I know it was done through George's attorney. I want the name of George's attorney and a copy of the agreement papers regarding the settlement. Also I want George's personal address where I can write him one letter.

Yes, under the circumstances we cannot trust George; therefore the temple construction must be considered in the next GBC meeting. Is this at Syamasundara's instigation; but you haven't mentioned anything like that. Or is it at the instigation of the neighbors of Letchmore Heath?

So for the time being you go on as we are. For the temple construction find out some place nearby. There are many houses. Let us go on with the Deity worship without any correspondence with them. You can find out there was some old newspaper that said George has given us the house. My picture was published. Where can I write George personally?

Regarding publishing the philosophy book, first of all I want to see the copy after it is edited. Hayagriva can do it. He is paid for that.

Gurudasa is coming to London, but he cannot be allowed to collect on any account. Enclosed is one letter from Brahmananda Maharaja to me that will explain.

Regarding German Switzerland territory, you cannot do anything with them? You cannot make any adjustment? Why are you referring to him this small thing?

I think George's home address is Henley-on-Thames. I have been there. Is this the correct address?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Do not instigate anything with them from our side. It is not necessary to contact them regarding the house. Go on with your business. For building the temple you can purchase some nearby land and construct. There are so many lands there I have seen. We are going to spend so much for the temple, so what is it to purchase some land?

If for some reason you have to vacate, then you can say we are constructing our another place. Anyway, you depend on Krishna. We do not depend upon anyone other than Krishna.
