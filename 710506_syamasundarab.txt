My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I'm very glad to inform you that we have reached Malaysia very shortly, that on my arrival there was nice meeting, and then we have come outside the city. Yesterday I was very busy all day.

I'm expecting some letter from Russia. So, if such letter comes, you can keep the original letter, but send me a copy. From here the program is I shall go to Sydney and then to Calcutta. So, I asked Tamala to let me know when they want me there. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
