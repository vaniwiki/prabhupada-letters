My dear Dina Bandhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Nov. 25, 1976.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept the devotees you have recommended for initiation. For first initiation their new names are; Sam R.---Syamasundara dasa and Jim N.---Jyotindra dasa. The second initiates are; Ramyaka dasa, Kaviraja dasa, Girijarata dasa, Abhaya dasi, and Srimati dasi. Now hold a fire sacrifice instructing the first initiates to always chant a minimum of sixteen rounds, and to strictly follow the regulative principles. Their beads may be chanted on by Ramesvara or Hrdayananda. Teach the second initiates how to chant on their finger divisions and let them hear the tape of me chanting Gayatri mantra in their right ears.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
