My Dear Shamadasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter dated 24th April, 1970, and thank you so much for the beautiful silken cloth. Nanda Kumar has placed the cloth on the wall just above the Deities and upon it is a picture of Radha Krsna. So how nicely the white silk is enhancing the picture.

Yes our new temple house is very, very nice, and the boys and girls here have renovated and decorated it very gorgeously. When the temple room is complete with the new altars, thrones, etc. I will send you some pictures and you will appreciate how nicely Krsna has provided for His service in L.A.

Yes, I will be very happy to have some of your Ph. D. Chapaties when you come here.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
