My dear Prabhaker,

I thank you very much for your letter dated nil, and I have carefully noted the contents. I have the same feeling upon you as my beloved son. And I still maintain the feeling hoping you will be a great help in the Krsna Consciousness Movement. The ideas given by you are provisionally accepted and it is possible for us to join together. Still, we need to meet to talk in detail.

I am leaving the country by the 23rd May and before leaving I may go to Vrindaban via New Delhi to see how the temple construction is going on. I am glad to know you met Tejyas which I requested you to do in my last letter. Anyway, if we meet in Delhi before I leave the country that will be nice. I shall inform you of the exact date of my going to Delhi and I will be glad to meet and discuss with you. Thank you once more for your letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
