My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7th November, 1971, and have noted the contents. It is very good news to hear that the German government has granted you a 5 year visa and that your Sankirtana activities are expanding. This is all very encouraging. Continue investigating for a temple in East Berlin and then inform me when you have heard some word.

Our festival here in Delhi is going very nicely. Every evening I am speaking with some chief guest, all coming from various fields of life.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
