My dear Madhavi Lata,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 24, 1968 which was sent from the Halawa Jail. It is nice that you are doing preaching work there, but you should know that such practices like stealing are against the principles of Krishna Consciousness. I always want that my students should be very ideal in character and not discredit our society. Actually, one who is in Krishna Consciousness automatically develops all of the good qualities which are possessed by the demigods. So we should always try to develop in this way by becoming fully surrendered to Lord Krishna. For Krishna we can execute any activity, but this is not free license to act whimsically. Arjuna was able to fight on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra because this was Krishna's desire, not because it was simply his whims. So please try to remember this and Krishna will help you surely as you are sincere soul.

I am pleased to know that even in such circumstances as the Halawa Jail you are taking opportunity to remember Krishna and to preach His Divine message to your acquaintances there. Already you have sparked some interest in some of the women there, and my request to these ladies is that they chant Hare Krishna loudly or softly, as they are able, and if they like they may order our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ which can be ordered from here in Los Angeles.

Please keep me informed as to your situation with the jail. I hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
