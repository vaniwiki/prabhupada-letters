My dear Tulsi das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 29, 1974. I am glad to learn that all the programs are going on nicely. Especially the college programs. If they are helping with funds, then there is much scope.

I am glad that you are taking the recommendation of new initiates very seriously, that they are writing essays. Yes, it is a serious matter. Not that let me take a spiritual master as a pet and I can do whatever I want. No, one must be prepared to follow the order of the spiritual master with life and soul.

I accept the following for second initiation, and the sanctified threads are enclosed: 1. Hamsavatara. das Adhikari, 2. Sangita devi dasi, 3. Loka Saranga das Brahmacari, 4. Omkara dasi, 5. Manindra devi dasi, 6. Divya devi dasi. On your recommendation I accept the following for first initiation and their names are as follows:

1. Roger Villalaban---Ranapriya,\\
2. Chuck---Ksetrajna dasa,\\
3. Roger Barbour---Raksana dasa,\\
4. Bob---Bhava dasa,\\
5. Glenn---Guruttama dasa,\\
6. Louis---Lohitaksa dasa,\\
7. Diane---Diksavati devi dasi,\\
8. Michelle---Mahavegavati devi dasi,\\
9. Dawn---Devamata devi dasi,\\
10. Andrea---Rasajna devi dasi,\\
11. Francie---Phalini devi dasi.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
