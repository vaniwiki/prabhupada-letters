My dear Bhaja Hari das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 10, 1975 with the enclosed clippings. The clippings are very interesting and I enjoyed them very much. I have been showing them here to all the people who have been visiting me. Yes, the plan you have sited for the lake and island is approved by me. I am very glad that you are doing this work and since the work started on September 8th, it is already going on. It is because you are charming the Indian community, therefore they are giving you money for these projects. So you should continue in this way.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
