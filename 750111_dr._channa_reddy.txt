My dear Dr. Channa Reddy,

Please accept the blessings of Lord Caitanya. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated December 25, 1974. I hope by this time, you have returned to Lucknow from your long tour in Hyderabad. So, I did not try to reply to this letter earlier.

My two secretaries, Srimad Bhagavan das Adhikari and Srimad Giriraja das Brahmacari tried their utmost to get an appointment from the secretary of the Governor of Maharashtra. His Excellency Nawab Ali Yavar Jung, but it was not successful. The reports of my secretaries are enclosed herein (please find).

I hope by this time, you might have received some reply from the Nawab Sahib. If so, kindly let me know what is the reply.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Encl: As above.
