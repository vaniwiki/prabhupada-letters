My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 22, 1969, and I have noted the contents with care. First of all I am pleased to know that you are feeling comfortable in Hawaii and you are keeping yourself busily engaged. I am glad that you and Murari are working on my Vyasasana, and as soon as it is completed, you can call me there, and I shall go. I think that if I am to go to Hawaii, I must go there by March, because in April I have other engagements in Columbia and other places.

I am pleased that you have been speaking to educationists and you are trying to introduce them to Krishna Consciousness. Try to introduce our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ into every university and college in Hawaii. Along with Gaurasundara try to convince them that our publication is the best. This will be great service. If need be, the chief man in various departments of the colleges may be given a copy of __Bhagavad-gita__ to go through and decide. In this way, try to introduce it into every college and University religious class and book department.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
