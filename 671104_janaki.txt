My dear Janaki,

Please accept my blessings. Every minute I think of you and and as you asked me to go to San Francisco while returning from India, I am trying to fulfill my promise. I am thinking of going directly to San Francisco. Please offer my blessings to Syamasundara, Malati, and others. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
