My dear Sudama Vipra Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 25, 1974 and have noted the contents. My advice to you is that whatever instruction you have received from me, just try to follow to your best. You must keep your sannyasa stage, because you have taken it from me. Wherever you go, try to follow the regulations, and Krsna will bless you. If Krsna blesses you, your life will be successful.

I do not want any personal service from you, but I want to keep you engaged in Krsna's service.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
