My dear Sriman Kashinath Mullick,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 12, 1976, to my Vrindaban address, and I have noted the contents with care. Since then I have left Vrindaban on my European and American tour and your letter was redirected to me here. From Vrindaban, I went to Australia, then Auckland, New Zealand, and then to Fiji Island where I laid the foundation stone for our new temple there. It was very gorgeously executed.

I am very glad to know that you are going to discuss the proposed matter amongst your contemporaries of the Subarnabanik Community and I shall be glad to hear the report.

I shall be staying in Hawaii at least up until June 1, 1976, at the above address, and then I shall go to Los Angeles where I can be reached at the following address 3764 Watseka Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90034, U.S.A. Thank you once more for your kind letter. Conveniently, if you find time you can visit our Krishna Balarama Temple in Vrindaban at Raman Reti which has now become the best attraction in Vrindaban.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
