My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter dated Oct. 3rd, sent to my Delhi address is redirected to Calcutta & therefore I have delayed in replying. We are again leaving this place for Navadvipa & you can reply there, the address you will find on the envelope. It is so nice to read your letter & the reply as to how you are always thinking for Krishna. When you write to say that "I would like very much to be teaching them Krishna Conscience instead of English" it reminds me of Lord Caitanya. For some time Lord Caitanya was conducting a __Catuspati,__ which is a small tutorial village class run by a learned Brahmin. When Lord Caitanya was teaching grammar to his students he was explaining Krishna. There is a chapter in Sanskrit grammar which is called __Dahtu,__ it is verbal denominations. Caitanya Mahaprabhu was explaining __Dahtu__ as Krishna & He would continue to explain Krishna in every step. When the students felt that the teacher was crazy the Transcendental Teacher closed his class. So your desire to teach Krishna Consciousness to the students instead of English is very nice & Krishna will be bestowing his blessings upon you for your thinking in that way. From my part as I am your ever well-wisher I wish that you may preach Krishna Consciousness to the students of the entire western world. You are a sincere soul & both your mother Father are happy to see you in Krishna Consciousness. Please continue this attitude throughout your life & you will be blessed not only in this life but in your next eternal life in association with Krishna. Krishna has given you a very nice chance in the city of Wilkes-Barre Penn. & the idea of purchasing land as you have suggested is very nice. I think you can negotiate for this land immediately & the Society will be able to pay $3,000.00. After purchasing the land you can gradually develop it into an asrama by dint of your personal labor as teacher in college. From N.Y. the members may visit the place every weekend because it isn't very far away. They take a 4 or 5 hour journey every week end so a 3 hour journey is not much. If you think you shall stick to your present occupation you can seriously think of this scheme.

I am already preparing for returning to U.S.A. & I have obtained visitors visa the day before yesterday. Most probably I shall take the first chance to return to USA upon my return from Navadvipa.

Regarding the Gita. I fully agree with your suggestions. So far MacMillan is concerned I shall be so glad to hand over the matter to them for publication, but in case they do not do it---please negotiate with another publisher & in the mean time keep the MSS ready, at least in 2 copies. I think there is no need to employ a professional typist. Our dear typist, Satsvarupa is always ready to do this work. He has already finished my book, __Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ & he is now free to type the Gita. So you can send it in installments & when he acknowledges receipt of first part you can send him the second, and so on. Or if possible you can hand it over to him personally, as you can conveniently arrange. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\

N.B. I am booking 3 Mridangas & 4 Harmoniums to New York & one Tambura to San Francisco.\\
