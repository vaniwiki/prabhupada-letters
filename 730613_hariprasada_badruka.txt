Sriman Hariprasada Badruka\\
Mahaboobgunj\\
Hyderabad, A.P.

My dear Badruka ji,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6/6/73.

My health is not yet recovered, but it is improving very slowly. So, I have been advised to stay here for at least four months, June, July, August and September. After that time it may be possible for me to go to Hyderabad and personally arrange both parts, preaching work and construction of the temple.

The difficulty is, unless we have legal possession of the land, how can we get municipal sanction for the construction. Under the circumstances, if Sriman Pulla Reddy donates the back portion of the land as promised and gives us legal right to construct the temple, we can then immediately get sanction from the municipality and begin construction. I am sure that within one year the construction will be complete and the Deity moved to the proper temple. At that time, if Mr. Pulla Reddy thinks it proper, he can donate the front portion also. Otherwise we shall vacate that portion without any doubt. This much I can promise to Mr. Pulla Reddy. So, he may kindly gives us legal right for constructing the temple.

I'm sending copy of this letter to Tamala Krsna Goswami at Bombay. You can contact him and do the needful.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
