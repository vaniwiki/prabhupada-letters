My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my greetings on your recovery from illness. I was so much anxious for your illness. Now I am relieved that you have come back from Hospital. I am also glad that you are doing your work for the Society nicely. My blessings for Karunamayi also. By separate post I am sending my Pass book, which may be presented as and when required. Where is Rayarama? He may take back from Kirtanananda the letter of introduction to __Miss D.C. Bowtell__ and may go to London as it was previously arranged. I entrusted this matter to Kirtanananda but he has disobeyed which has given me a shock. Once he disobeyed my order and we lost $1200.00 in connection with Mr. Payne. This time he has again disobeyed me. If he sets such example in the Society it will be a great impediment. Obedience is the first law of discipline. We are thinking of a great world wide organization which is not possible to be executed if there is disobedience.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
