My dear Kirtanananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your report is very nice. It is wonderful to hear that you are distributing 1000 magazines and collecting $1,000 daily. Now, you have plenty of money, milk, fruits, flowers, grains, everything, and you are living in the jungle. What more could you want? I may be coming there immediately after the Philadelphia Rathayatra, and I shall stay until after Janmastami.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
