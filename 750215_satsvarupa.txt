My dear Satsvarupa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 8th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for sending the book reviews. Send more if you can. These are very very encouraging. I am keeping a collection of these reviews and I show them to big big scholars and professors when they come to see me. They are very impressed.

Regarding your lecturing in the college classes. This is a very good program also. Why not continue it?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
