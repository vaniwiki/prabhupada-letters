====== Letter to: Bibhavati ======

CAMP: 37/1 Hindusthan Road; Calcutta-29; India

My Dear Bibhavati, 

Please accept my blessings. Your letter addressed to His Holiness the President of Gaudiya Math, Bagh Bazar, is in my hand. Previous to this letter I received two or three letters from you, but for want of time I could not reply them.

Don’t be agitated by the false propaganda of some rascals. I know you are very simple, ignorant girl and your mind has been unnecessarily troubled. Be fixed up in your devotional service. Chant Hare Krsna mantra at least sixteen rounds on the beads. If you like to come to Calcutta, you are welcome, but there is no necessity. Where is your husband? Who is the rascal who said that you are no longer my official devotee? You are my devotee eternally. Don’t be agitated in this way. Await my detailed letter following.

In the meantime Hayagriva has written one nice article, “the Spiritual Master: Emissary of the Supreme Persona”. That will clear out the whole situation. You try to read it. I think you and your husband along with your daughter should go back to New Vrndavana and live there peacefully. The Spiritual Master never claims that he is God---that is Mayavadi philosophy. But he is offered the same respect because he is very confidential servant of God. This thing has been very nicely explained in the above article and have patience to read it.

Our preaching work in India is going on nicely. We have got already two places preaching centers in Calcutta and daily Samkirtan Party is going in important market places. So do not be agitated. You have got all my blessings. Be peaceful and chant Hare Krishna.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
