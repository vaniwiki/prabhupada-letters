My dear Lilavati dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 2, 1975 and have noted the contents. Bhagavan das and Brahmananda Swami have suggested that you go to London and collect the money for your ticket there and then immediately go to Africa to help there. I think that will be nice. Make sure that you follow all of the rules and regulations, and chant at least 16 rounds daily. That will make you out of the reach of Maya.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
