My dear Mahamsa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am enclosing herewith a bank draft on Punjab National Bank No. 224835 dated 20/8/74 for the amount of Rs. 60,000/-. Please acknowledge receipt.

The balance Rs. 40,000/- will be forwarded to you at the end of this month.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
