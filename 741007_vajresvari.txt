New Vrindaban

My dear Vajresvari devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 11, 1974 (sic.) I have noted in your letter that you want to serve me. I only want that all you my disciples always think of Krishna and never forget Him for a moment. In this way you can conquer Krishna. He becomes so attracted by pure devotion that He gives Himself to His devotee. And if you get Krishna, then what you want more?

How to think of Krishna that I have given, following the devotional practices and chanting 16 rounds minimum. We have also established worship of the Deity in our temple so that all day long one will automatically think of Krishna, He is so kind. So now Kirtanananda Maharaja has recommended you for twice born initiation. __Dvija__: (__dvi__ means twice and __ja__ means birth. Now you finish your old birth with the fire of Krishna consciousness. Worship Krishna with love. That is the qualification for Deity worship. If you love Krishna, you will worship Him very nicely.

So follow Kirtanananda Maharaja in this connection. He can guide you. Our New Vrindaban scheme is meant for peaceful living, simple life of chanting Hare Krishna and becoming purified.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
