My dear Prabhakar Mishra:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1975 addressed to my Los Angeles address and redirected from there just now. I am enclosing herewith one invitation card to our Janmastami and Vyasa Puja Day celebration. So if you come we can discuss further the points.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
