Camp Bombay July 28, 1965

My dear Buro,

On the eve of my leaving India for America on the 9th of August 1965, I want to see you for entrusting you with money and books in the matter of my publication SRIMAD BHAGWATAM so far advanced.

I am going to America on the mission of propagating my publication Srimad Bhagwatam and I am taking with me 200 sets X 3 volumes of books depending solely on the goodwill of Srila Prabhupada. I had no difficulty for getting the passport but it was too difficult to get the "P" form sanctioned on account of strict Exchange control, but by the grace of Srila Prabhupada yesterday the Controller of Exchange has allowed me to go.

When I first met Srila Prabhupada in 1922 as the young manager of Dr. Bose's Laboratory Ltd, at first sight He desired me to do what I am just going to do and I have taken all risks of life just to carry out His order. When he came to Bombay and you were only a child of four years old, on your bowing down before Him, He was pleased to bless you and six months later when I saw Him at Radhakunda along with you, because in those days you were my constant companion, His Divine Grace lovingly called you as the cowboy friend of Lord Krishna and enquired from you where were your cows? So do not forget such causeless mercy of a great associate of Lord Krishna and just try to corporate with me in this great mission and especially in my ripe old age of seventy.

Now the only difficulty is that in my absence the printing work will remain suspended for want of supervision.

What I want that you may take the responsibility and I am prepared to pay you Rs 100/- one hundred per month. Please [illegible handwriting] this cause of Srila Prabhupada. On your serving the cause of Srila Prabhupada you will be profited both materially and spiritually, which I am seeing very clearly. Once this publication is established you [illegible] will get lacs and crores and the loss which you might have thought of on my leaving you all alone, -will now be compensated sufficiently if you cooperate in this great work.

There is no anxiety for money now and I shall arrange for everything and you have simply to manage the affairs and take your remuneration also. I do not wish to entrust the matter to a third person because I am confident that you shall be able to do it nicely in my absence. The printing work must go on otherwise such a big project cannot be fructified.

I am reaching Calcutta (Howrah Station) on the (3rd) third of August 1965 at 11 a.m. by the down Calcutta mail via Nagpur.

Please, therefore, see me at the station at the above scheduled time If you however [illegible] to meet me (on 3/8/65 at 11 a.m) then please meet me at the following address where I shall put up viz. 65 A, Pathuriaghata Street [illegible] the house of Govindalal Bangur. Hope you are well and [illegible] we meet.

Yours affectionately,\\
[Prabhupada's Signature]
