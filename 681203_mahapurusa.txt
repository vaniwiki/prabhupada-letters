====== Letter to: Mahapurusa ======

My dear Mahapurusa,

Please accept my blessings. I was so glad to receive your letter which was written by hand (undated). I had just been thinking of and wondering why you do not write to me. Although I am overcrowded by so many letters from my beloved spiritual sons and daughters, still if I don't receive a letter from one, I become anxious for it. So you and Murari should more often write to me. That will very much engladden me to my heart.

I know that you are a sincere Vaisnava, and every one of your god-brothers praises you nice Vaisnava qualities. Chant Hare Krishna and always live peacefully.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
