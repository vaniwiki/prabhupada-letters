My dear Mr. D.D.D.

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated as well as the enclosed booklet, and I thank you very much for these.

I have read your version of the Bhagavad-gita, first chapter and it is very interesting to read how the armies were present on the battlefield of Kuruksetra and how Lord Krishna became the charioteer of His friend and devotee, Arjuna. Also I have read your excerpt from Teachings of Lord Caitanya and it was very relishable to read. So take instruction from Bhagavad-gita in this way. Your handwriting is so nice, so by printing such booklets and learning Bhagavad-gita you can then instruct others and Krishna will bless you.

Please take nice care of the cows there for me and make sure that everyone is chanting their 16 rounds. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
