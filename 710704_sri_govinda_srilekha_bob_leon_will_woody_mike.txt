My dear Sri Govinda, Srilekha, Bob, Leon, Will, Woody and Mike Prabhus.

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter dated nil. You will be glad to know that very soon I am coming to N.Y., perhaps by the middle of this month. So perhaps it will be possible for you to come and see me there. Or else, shortly thereafter I may visit Pittsburgh and New Vrindaban, so that may be more convenient for you; whatever is permitted by Krishna.

Thank you so much for your eagerness to see me. I am doing the work of my Guru Maharaja and similarly you also help me and we will be all benefited in Krishna Consciousness.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
