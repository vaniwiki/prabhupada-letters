My dear Narayani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your kindly presentation of $20. check as daksina. I am so glad to hear that you are presently engaged in Krishna's service there in our Gainesville temple. It is very nice temple and Gainesville appears to be a very good place for spreading Lord Caitanya's message. So work cooperatively with Hrdayananda and the other devotees there and make our Gainesville center a grand success. Work sincerely and enthusiastically for pushing on this movement, regularly chant your 16 rounds of beads and follow all the regulative principles faithfully, then Krishna will surely bless you for making rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
