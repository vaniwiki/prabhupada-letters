My dear Abhirama das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 9, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

You can continue to work at trying to get the park for constructing our temple there as previously planned. Keep me informed as to the progress.

So far the land in Jagannatha Puri is concerned, we can have a nice temple on 21 acres of land.* You can negotiate the rental fees and inform me accordingly before proceeding further with this project.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
