My dear Mrdapriya dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. It is never too late to become Krishna Conscious. If you actually follow all of the regulative principles and chant 16 rounds avoiding the offenses, and attend the mangala arati and classes, then Krishna will see that you are sincerely trying to follow the real process of Krishna Consciousness. Don't try to manufacture some artificial process. The process I have already given. Now you simply have to follow it strictly and Krishna will give you all help.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
