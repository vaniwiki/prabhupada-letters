====== Letter to: Sivananda ======

My dear Sivananda Prabhu,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 23 April, 1969, addressed to the New York temple and redirected here. I am so much obliged to you for picking up the "Jugantar" publication of your activities in London. I understand that you are sending an annual subscription fee for __Back To Godhead,__ but it is $5.00 per year. It is Rs 7.5 exchange for one dollar, so I do not know how you have calculated. Acyutananda's address is c/o Caitanya Saraswat Math, Kolerganj, P.O. Navadvipa, Dist., Nadia, West Bengal. Regarding your questions about my books, we are presently selling six volumes; namely __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ (three volumes), __Bhagavad-gita As It Is, Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ and __Easy Journey To Other Planets.__

I am very much thankful for your promise to help me in my missionary activities, and I shall be glad to know about your press, whether you can print first class books in art paper and linotype composition. If so, we can give you so much work. We have got many books to be printed yet. If it is cheaper than in Japan, we can immediately give you some business. From Calcutta we may purchase many articles for being dispatched to our various centers. I do not know whether you can help us in that respect. We are importing many mrdangas and other musical instruments, Navadvipa karatalas also, so please tell me if you can help us in this respect. You can make some profit in this also.

I will be happy to be hearing again from you soon. I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
