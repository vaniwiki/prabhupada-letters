My dear Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I have just now received your letter of 16-5-73 along with newspaper clippings. I have also seen some of these clippings when I was in London recently and some devotees from your temple were initiated by me.

For the devotees of the Lord there always many difficulties for propagating Krsna Consciousness among the nondevotee demons. But we must learn to tolerate all the difficulties and push on regardless of whatever obstacles we may be presented with. No one can stop this Krsna Consciousness Movement because Lord Caitanya wants that His Holy Names will be spread to every village and town. So go on with the preaching work and keep me informed of your progress.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
