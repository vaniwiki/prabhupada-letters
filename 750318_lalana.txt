====== Letter to: Lalana ======

Miami

My dear Lalana devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3-7-75 and have noted the contents. It is very nice that you are learning to weave. That is a great asset to have. I have no objection to your coming to India as long as your temple president and GBC do not object. So, consult with them and do the needful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
