My dear Vicitravirya,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8th December, 1976.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept the devotees; Tirthakara das, Mahavidya das, Jagatam dasi, Jagannathaisvare dasi, for second initiation. Now, hold a fire yajna for devotees only. Let the new brahmanas hear the tape of me chanting Gayatri in their right ears, and teach them to chant on their finger divisions.

It is a very nice report of book distribution. Your proposal to make 20 devotees per month is also very nice.

Yes, the accounts must be kept very clearly. Then everyone will be pleased with us. Not a single farthing should be wasted. That will be our credit.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
