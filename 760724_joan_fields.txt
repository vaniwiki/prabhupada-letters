My dear Joan Fields:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very nice gifts and the donation towards the book fund. This is the way to advance in Krishna consciousness. One should always offer to the spiritual master whatever one can. One should chant the Hare Krsna mantra at least 16 rounds daily and follow the four regulative principles then one's life can become perfect. Always try to remember Krsna in all your activities and gradually He will help you to break free of all material attachments of life and along with your sincere desire your path back home back to godhead can be clear. One should always be sincere to please the spiritual master by following his instructions, then life is very easy.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
