My dear Abhirama das,

Please accept my blessings. Please let me know how negotiations are going on with acquiring the park across the way, for making "Bhaktivedanta Park." You should concentrate on getting the park. The house is of secondary importance.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
