Dear Jaya tirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I have received two letters recently from Gandharva das Adhikari of the Los Angeles Temple. He is feeling some inconvenience, as he states it, due to the younger devotees not showing proper respect to him as he is their elder, old enough to be their father. So they should show the proper respect, as is befitting a Vaisnava, who offers respects to one and all. It is sometimes difficult for elderly people to live in our ISKCON society, so you have to make it as congenial as possible for them and see that they are peaceful in all respects. Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
