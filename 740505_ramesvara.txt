Dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I received a letter from Atreya Rsi das dated April 18, 1974. In that letter he mentions your name as follows:

"I have just received one letter from Jagadisa Prabhu who has been told by Tamala Krishna das Goswami Maharaja and Ramesvara Prabhu that recently more than one million dollars in funds from BBT, MVT and other contributors have been transferred into your personal accounts and that only yourself is in knowledge of the exact details of deposits and withdrawals."

This report is inaccurate and very dangerous and it has concerned me very much. Since your name is mentioned here as making this report kindly write to me and let me know what is the actual fact as to what you said.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
