My dear Dr. Wolf,

Please accept my blessings. I received your kind letter dated March 7, 1976 which was hand-delivered to me. Very soon I shall be able to see you and talk. Kindly chant Hare Krishna, and follow the regulative principles, see the Deity in the temple, and take Krishna prasadam.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
