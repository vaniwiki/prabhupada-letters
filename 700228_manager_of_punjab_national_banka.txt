Dear Sir:

Re: My savings fund account No. 2913 with you

Replying your letter No. 464 dated 2 February, 1970, addressed to my London Temple and now redirected to me here, I beg to inform you that when you received Rs. 33, 705.86 I submitted a note of purpose in which it was stated that the money was meant for purchasing books and securing a small piece of land. You may find out this note in our file.

So out of this money immediately a consignment of books worth Rs. 13,000 and odds was sent to U.S.A., and then again these eight cases under reference were sent. So there is no more balance of books to be received against this amount of Rs. 33,705.86. There is no more pending order.

Now I beg to draw your attention to my letter dated 13 January, 1970, in which I requested you to transfer Rs. 5,500 to your Calcutta Branch at Brabourne Road for credit of my savings fund account No. 2595. I have not heard anything either from you or your Calcutta office. Please let me know what is the fate of my instruction in this connection. Also kindly let me know what is the balance in my account at present.

Thanking you in anticipation of an early reply.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
