Dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am not exactly certain of your whereabouts now; I trust your arrangements for visa are going on and that you will soon be back in Australia.

I am presently fixing a traveling schedule for visiting Paris, France in the second week of May. Then I will visit, Geneva, Rome, Stockholm, and three or four cities in Germany, each place for no more than four or five days. So since I will not have to return to India until August, after Europe I can go to Australia for your Rathayatra if you can purchase our tickets. You can reply to me here in Bombay until the second week of May, when we shall go to Paris.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
