My dear Jayatirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated December 1st, 1976 from South Africa.

That the devotees refuse to follow those who do not keep strictly to the regulative principles is very nice. These practices are our spiritual strength.

I'm glad to hear that you are feeling spiritually strong. Krsna will give you all intelligence and protection. You are a sincere servant.

I will be glad to go to the Rathayatra festival in Durban next year if they will allow me into the country. They are very strict.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
