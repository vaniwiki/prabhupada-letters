Dear Dhiranga,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of 31st December and have studied the contents.

Your report is very good in all respects. Combining your efforts on one nice farm seems best. Now live there and also go out from there for preaching, as they do on the New Vrindaban farm. Grow more grains, fruits, keep cows, make a happy home and chant Hare Krsna. The existence of a lake on the land is a great advantage.

Krsna has sent you some new devotees, now keep them and train them. They should not feel inconvenience. As a matter of etiquette you should tell them that if they feel any inconvenience they should inform you and you can fix their situation.

The traveling bus program has been successful in other parts of the world, therefore increase it, as possible. Yes, when you are ready you can install Jagannath deities. Any of the GBC men can perform the installation. So you have a very good field there, and you are developing it carefully. Just continue to increase your enthusiasm and your preaching will come out more and more favorable. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
