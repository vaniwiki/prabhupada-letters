Dear Kirtiraja das Adhikary

Please accept my humble obeisances. I am due receipt of your letter dated November 10, 1974, and have noted the contents. Regarding the correct form for Srila Prabhupada's name for appearing in publishing books, it should be as follows:

BHAKTIVEDANTA, SWAMI A.C.

You should see that henceforth all 13 volumes of Srimad Bhagavatam are listed, in Four Cantos, and that they are published by Bhaktivedanta Book Trust.

The Krsna books can be listed as: KRSNA. However in the formal name of the Society the KRISHNA form is used.

I hope this meet you in good health.

Your servant,\\
Brahmananda Swami\\
Personal Secretary\\
Approved: ACBS\\
(Initialed by Prabhupada)
