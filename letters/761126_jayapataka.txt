====== Jayapataka ======

Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am advising you by this letter to advance Rs. 10,000 to Prabhusvarupa in Haridasapur. He is to add another Rs. 5,000. With the Rs. 15,000 you may open a bank account there. You, Bhavananda and Prabhusvarupa may be the signers. Any 2 or 3 may sign on the cheques. Send site plan to Saurabha.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
