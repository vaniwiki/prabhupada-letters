====== Letter to: Dr. Wolf ======

Los Angeles

My dear Dr. Wolf,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August, 1976 and have noted the contents. Yes, this attitude will help you. Always pray to Krsna humbly and He will surely help you, __tesam satata yuktanam bhajatam priti purvakam dadami buddhi yogam tam yena mam upayanti te__ [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]], to those who worship Me with love, I give them the intelligence by which they can come to Me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
