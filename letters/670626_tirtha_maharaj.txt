====== Tirtha Maharaj — 26 June 1967 ======

My dear Sripad Tirtha Maharaj (Maharij),

Kindly accept my obeisances (obiesences). I am in due receipt of your letter dated 17 June 1967, and I thank you very much for the same. My present position is on the margin;sometimes I feel normal and sometimes I feel abnormal. Anyway, the boys here are taking best possible care for me, and I am getting, day by day, improved. They have taken a house for my compete rest at Sebastopol (Savastapol) in California. If Prabhupada (prabhupad) wills, I shall go next week to San Francisco, which is near by.

I understand that ayurvedic treatment cannot be made possible without being present in India. If I think that it is absolutely necessary, then I may go directly to Calcutta from San Francisco.  I shall always be in touch with you, informing you about my health, as you have so kindly desired.

I have not received the certificate (cirtificate) which you sent on the 2nd May; please, therefore, send me the certificate (cirtificate) by return registered post to the following address:

Sriman Mukunda Das Adikary\\
c/o I S K C O N\\
518 Fredricks Street\\
San Francisco, California\\
U.S.A.

Kindly pray to Srila Prabhupad so that I can execute my duty for which I have come here. I pray for your blessings also.

Affectionately yours,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
