My Dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 28th, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am so pleased to learn of your hard work for writing Krishna Consciousness essays. When Shama Dasi leaves for Columbus to begin her composing tasks, you will require another Dictaphone. There is one almost new Dictaphone lying in Montreal temple. You can write to Jayapataka, who is in charge there, that when I come to New York on my way to Europe he may bring the Dictaphone for you to take back to New Vrindaban for the time being. Then when other arrangements are made you shall return it to him.

Please take care of Birbhadra, Girish and Dwarkadish, and make them nice brahmacharies. Treat them like your own children. These boys are future hope for our preaching Krishna Consciousness, so help them grow in that spirit. I am enclosing herewith separate letters for Anuradha and Labangalatika Dasi. I have informed them that they may remain in New Vrindaban for the remainder of the summer if this is their wish and if Kirtanananda Maharaj agrees.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
