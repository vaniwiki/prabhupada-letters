My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your zonal report of May 28 and have examined the contents.

From your report it appears that the transfer of the older Gurukula boys above ten years old has proven successful. I am glad to hear they are housed in a clean building with electricity and hot and cold water and that their teacher from Dallas is with them instructing them just as before. I am always eager to hear that Gurukula is going well so be very vigilant that this program with the older boys in New Vrindaban as well as all levels of teaching at Dallas are just to the standard as I introduced it. There is no more important school in the world, so it requires careful guidance.

Yes, the farm plan in New Orleans is fine. But one thing is if we get land we must first be sure we will be able to fully utilize it, otherwise, if we cannot use it what is the use? I want the world to see by our example that life can be lived naturally, peacefully if one is self sufficient with land, some cows and chanting Hare Krishna. That is the idea of purchasing land. It is not necessary that every temple have a farm, but as many as can be efficiently managed locally is all right. Let them see our centers are self sufficient. Whatever can be managed conveniently. If they can manage a farm in Detroit also, what is the harm?

Yes, consult with BaliMardan and if the new building required for our Montreal center is reasonable in all respects then purchase it.

I can understand that you are travelling widely and managing many projects over a great area. Krsna will give you stamina and intelligence to carry out more and more projects successfully in His Name, provided you are sincere and remain strong spiritually by following the regulative principles.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
