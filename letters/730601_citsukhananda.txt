====== Citsukhananda ======

Caracas

My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 24, 1973.

Thank you very much for your kind note. I am feeling a little stronger now. Tomorrow we are going to Mayapur where I want to take complete rest for some time. After my recovery I will return to Los Angeles and at that time I would be very pleased to come to Caracas. So please contact me when I go to Los Angeles and we can make arrangements at that time.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
