My dear Deoji Punja:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two letters dated August 6th and August 15th together with the revised plans for the temple. The pujari room on the first floor behind the temple is not meant as living quarters for the Pujari. It is meant for storing the Deity paraphernalia, making flower garlands, etc. No toilets should be on this floor. Water taps will be needed however for washing the Deity utensils and prasadam plates of the Deity. Also on the Ground Floor on the first plan there were living quarters, but on the second plan there is only one big Library. Where will our men live? Living should be on the Ground Floor.

Regarding the adjacent piece of land, if you can donate, then the adjacent land owner can also donate. The management of affairs should be in the hands of my devotees. Your program for making Life Members is approved by me. You should work under the supervision of the GBC.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
