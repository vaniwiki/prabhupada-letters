My Dear Kirtanananda, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter (undated), and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very pleased to learn of your successful preaching work in Antioch College. Your idea of obtaining a vehicle for traveling around to many such engagements is nice. As sannyasi, you can ask somebody to give a nice truck for this cause. But you must have one brahmachary as your assistant. So if you make a traveling program, it will be very, very nice. A sannyasi requires to travel as much as possible. So Krishna is giving you now the chance. You should carry out this opportunity very carefully and with good sense also. Regarding collecting money, a sannyasi's name is vikshu, or licensed beggar. Not only sannyasi, but a brahmachary also is required to collect for his Spiritual Master. The Spiritual Master spends for missionary activities. So in the beginning you may feel some inconvenience to collect because you are not accustomed, but if you try for it, depending on Krishna, there will be no difficulty. For developing the New Vrindaban scheme you shall require such help from the richer circles. We are trying to give some valuable service to the society, and at least some people must know it and appreciate. It doesn't matter whether they contribute or not. But they must be informed at least about the Krishna Consciousness Movement. The collection is not by any force, rather it is voluntary. If they are convinced of our good work, surely they will come forward with some contribution.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
