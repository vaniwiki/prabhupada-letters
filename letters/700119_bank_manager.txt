Dear Sir:

Re: My Account No. 51-05463 with you

I thank you very much for sending me the pass book.

But I am surprised to see one item: withdrawal of $10.08 (ten dollars and eight cents) on the 16th December, 1969. I have not withdrawn anything, so how it so happens?

Please therefore correct the pass book sent herewith, and send it back.

Yours Sincerely,\\
A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
