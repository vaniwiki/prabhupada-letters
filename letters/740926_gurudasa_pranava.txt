====== Gurudasa, Pranava ======

<card class="letter">
Vrindaban

My dear Gurudasa and Pranava:

Please accept my blessings. This is to request you to go see Sri Seth Hanuman Prasad Poddar, Churuwalla Thek, Swami Ghat, P.O. Mathura, U.P. He is the managing director of a large plot of land near Birla Mandir between Mathura and Vrindaban. He will give us 25 bighas at Mathura Gochar Bhumi as a concessional free gift. So immediately go and see the land, and if suitable then immediately take it.

Do not be disturbed that it is a little far away from our temple. That we shall be able to manage, and it is not a problem. If you can manage this land nicely, they can give more. They want to see that the land is used for cow protection. The land is meant for this purpose.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. This is to inform you that on October 5, 1974 one lakh will be transferred to Vrindaban so there will be no difficulty for purchasing the other land if the negotiations will be complete by then.
