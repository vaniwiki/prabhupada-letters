====== Letter to: Pradyumna ======

My dear Pradyumna,

I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 11, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. You may immediately arrange for purchasing the machine. Make a contract, and I have advised Brahmananda to pay you the $503 when you need it. So when the transaction is completed, immediately call Brahmananda and he will pay you. Now Arundhati and Syama Dasi shall be in charge of composing at least four hours alternately. In this way, the machine should be used from 7:00 in the morning till 10:00 at night. Syama Dasi may type from 7:00 in the morning till 11:00 o'clock. Then Arundhati will type from 11 till three. Then Syama Dasi from three until seven o'clock, and Arundhati from seven o'clock until ten o'clock. In this way, you and Hayagriva shall guide them so that the machine will be fully utilized.

I am sure that the monthly payments shall be arranged by you, and this is very good. Special care should be given to keep the machine in a safe room which is always closed and always locked. The property is worth about $6,000, and you will be responsible for the payments, so very much care should be taken to protect it from any damage or theft. Of course your quarters there are nice, but all necessary precautions must still be taken. Please write to inform me what you are going to do.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
