====== Vaikunthanatha ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Vaikunthanatha,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife, Saradia Dasi. I am very glad to hear from you after some time and I am glad that you are feeling very happy in our Society. That is the sign of advancement in spiritual life that one is detached from material sense gratification and finds pleasure in serving Krsna only.

I think as you say that Trinidad is the "stepping stone" to South America and it is very good proposal that you and your wife shall go there with the encouragement and support of some natives. When people are so eager for Krsna consciousness, it is our duty to go and enlighten them. Lord Caitanya wanted this mission spread up all over the globe. Now you are kindly helping to fulfill His transcendental desire. I am very anxious to see this movement having centers in all the important cities of all the seven continents. That will serve the purpose to bring in unification of the entire world under the banner of Krsna Consciousness Movement within a very short time.

The secret of preaching work is that one must keep himself fit in spiritual strength by maintaining always the highest standard of purity in Krsna consciousness. Our process is simple and practically experimented everywhere. Simply by vibrating the Hare Krsna Mahamantra sixteen rounds daily one advances to the stage of __sadacara__ or good habits and when he is pure in consciousness by devotional service, he advances to the stage of ecstatic love of Krsna. We should always pray to Lord Caitanya simply to be engaged in His confidential service by chanting Hare Krsna mantra always. That will purify us and give the strength needed to infuse others with Krsna consciousness.

I will be very glad to receive the package of Deity clothes made by Saradia, but they have not arrived yet. I have been travelling about between many provinces of India and my mail is not always received timely. Anyway, I am expecting them at any moment.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
