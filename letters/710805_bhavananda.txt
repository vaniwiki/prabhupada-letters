My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I understand from Karandhara that you had some telephone conversation on the matter of changing places. In my opinion, Karandhara is required on the western side and you are required in N.Y. center. You have organized N.Y. very nicely; I give you all credit for this. But if you are insisting and require some change, then the best thing to do is to go to Mayapur and manage the building construction there. Tamala has written in his last letter that he has no experience in such building affairs and he wants to appoint some big contractors. That will be too expensive. We can save that amount by supervising ourselves this construction. That will be favorable for our purpose.

If you decide that you will go to Mayapur then you should apply for missionary visa from there. If there is any difficulty then I can submit your name from here and you can stop over in London to pick up your visa on the way to India. That can be done for any number of devotees planning to go to India, so this information should be passed on to all our centers.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there in N.Y. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
