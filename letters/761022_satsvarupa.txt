====== Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your report dated October 4, 1976.

I am happy to hear of our great victory at the Chicago airport. Do not mind the dogs barking to get us out of the temple in Chicago. Stay in the temple and prolong as far as possible. In Bombay they tried to evict us in so many ways, but Krsna allowed us to stay and now we are going forward.

Regarding your library work, yes you simply have to try your best. We simply have to work sincerely. Success or no success, that is up to Krsna. Duhkhesv anudvigna-manah/sukhesu vigata-sprhah/Gita 2.56. Yes, you may familiarize yourselves with psychology, sociology, etc. I, also, touch upon these subjects wherever possible. Krsna is all-pervading, therefore we touch everything. Here in India they are also getting good numbers of standing orders from the professors.

It will be a great achievement if you can write this book on the theme, “anything undertaken without Krsna fails.” Here in India we have just seen how they have made a big, big plan for the city of Chandigarh. So much land is lying vacant, and in the meantime people are going hungry. Because they are not Krsna conscious, they do not know how to utilize anything properly. They are simply thinking of satisfying their own senses. So many big, big plans, but the result is that people are unhappy. Napoleon and Hitler made big, big plans, where are they now? All failures. Churchill wanted to keep India under control. Gandhi wanted to drive away the Englishmen. Now, the Englishmen are driven away and things are going on by the laws of nature. Churchill and others have remained in comatose condition before dying due to excessive attachment to their plans. All failures.

Yes, there is no harm if you have to do some research. Krsna will supply the materials. You may write slowly, but give something full of meaning and instruction for the misguided people of this age.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Please find enclosed some questions and answers I have given for Bhavans Cultural and Religious Journal in Bombay. This may give you some help in writing your book.
