My dear Mahajana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 21, 1975 and have noted the contents. As far as this matter is concerned, it is my desire that you consult your local Governing Body Commissioner Jayatirtha das. Now I am desiring more and more to have time for translating my books, not that I have to become involved in every question. For this reason I have installed the GBC. Now I have given the guideline that 50% of a householder's income should be donated to the temple. If there is any disagreement, it may be taken up with Jayatirtha.

I hope this meets you and your family in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
