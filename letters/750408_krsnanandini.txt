====== Letter to: Krsnanandini ======

Cleveland

My dear Krsnanandini devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 3rd, 1975 and have noted the contents carefully. Regarding Bhumata devi dasi's affliction, she should simply take the proper treatment. Make the best out of a bad bargain. This material body is a bad bargain because it is always miserable. So, to make the best out of this bad bargain means to render devotional service in any circumstance. The dust from the lotus feet of the spiritual master is never to be used for material benefit. That is a great misconception. The best thing is that the girl tries her best to chant 16 rounds daily and to follow all of the rules and regulations even if she is afflicted with something, and in this way, she willfully understand the mercy of Krishna and the spiritual master.

I will be in Hawaii in May and June and then American mainland for about 6 weeks. She can send her offering to Hawaii.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
