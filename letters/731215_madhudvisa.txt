====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 11, 1973. Thank you for the comprehensive report of our Australian theater of ISKCON. I am glad that things are going nicely and that you have settled up the New Zealand affair. Depend on Krsna and He will give you good intelligence. I am pleased that you are managing things so nicely.

I have seen pictures of the house you are trying for and it is very gorgeous. If you can purchase it, that will be a great credit for you. Krsna will recognize your service and it will be a great push forward for our movement. I pray to Krsna that you may become successful in this attempt.

I have not heard from Tusta Krsna or Siddha-Svarupa Goswamis nor do I know anything of their plans to return to New Zealand. Try to convince them to return to our Society and work cooperatively. That they have gone away is not good thing and it is a deviation from our line of parampara. Rather, avoiding faultfinding and anarchy, they should keep our standards and work maturely and not cause factions and splitting. I am not at all pleased at what they have done, but if they return let us forget what has happened and go forward. As Sannyasins they may preach and you may manage affairs. That will be very nice. We have got so much vital spiritual knowledge to distribute to the public and they are in desperate need of it. The whole world is going to hell and everyone is suffering. In light of this, how can we argue amongst one another and neglect our responsibility for reclaiming these fallen souls for going Back to Home, Back to Godhead.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
