====== Hansadutta ======

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of the check for $321 Canadian dollars and I thank you very much for it. Just now I am going to send credit to Dai Nippon in Japan for $6,000 so I require some money for the book fund.

You are thinking of accepting a job but you are already in the job of Krishna, so for the maintenance of Krishna's temple you can contemplate as Krishna desires. But I will suggest, why do you not start the prasada program? It was in our contemplation for a longtime and you and your wife are expert cooks. There's ample space in our temple. Why not organize the prasada program. That will be both spiritual propaganda and monetary gain also.

Besides that I'll suggest instead of accepting job outside, why not try to sell our books? Bhagavad-gita is already published. If you want to sell, immediately ask Brahmananda to send you as many copies as you can sell and there also is a source of income.

Next month we are getting Teachings of Lord Caitanya. Dayala Nitai knows how to sell books, so both Dayala Nitai, yourself and the others, if you attempt to sell our books that will be the most glorious job. Plus if you can distribute prasada
