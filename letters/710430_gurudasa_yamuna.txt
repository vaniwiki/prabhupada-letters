====== Gurudasa, Yamuna ======

My dear Gurudasa and Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated 26th April, 1971 and have noted the contents. Regarding Vrindaban, perhaps by now you have seen the place. Presently Mahantaji wants to transfer the property to us and wants to go there to Vrindaban on the 8th or the 15th May. So now you can decide when to go there so that he can transfer the property to us and at the same time have Sankirtana, preferably for two or three days. So decide amongst yourselves which of the two days is more convenient and write Mahantaji. His address is as follows: Mahanta Dhinabandhudas; Char Samprada temple; Panchavati; Nasik.

When the date is fixed up, you can write both Hansadutta and Madhudvisa so that some men can come and join you there in Vrindaban. Perhaps you know that Hansadutta is now in Ahmedabad. His address is as follows: c/o Chimanlal M. Soni; Manekchawk Sankdhishere; Kehjdapol Vithal Niwas; Ahmedabad-1, Gujarat. Probably I will not be able to join you since I am going to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then on to Sydney Australia, and will be starting Monday morning.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
