====== Sri K. L. Goswami ======

<card class="letter">
Dear Sri K.L. Goswami,

Replying your letter of July 23rd, 1969, I beg to enclose herewith some newspaper cuttings for your information how we have performed Rathayatra Ceremony in San Francisco, London, Buffalo, Boston and Ohio.

Regarding the land, we are already negotiating for some land on the bank of the Ganges in Navadvipa. The price is cheaper there. I think Serampore being an industrial center, the price is very high. So anyway, I beg to thank you for your kind information. If our negotiations in Navadvipa are not fruitful, then I shall again write to you about this.

Thank you very much for your kind letter.

Sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
