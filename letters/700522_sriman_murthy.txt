====== Letter to: Sriman Murthy ======

Toronto

My dear Sriman Murthy,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated May 17th, 1970, but I am very sorry to learn that you have been victimized by a rascal who claims to be Lord Krsna. You are an educated boy, and I am surprised how you have been so befooled as to accept an ordinary man as Krsna. Anyway, Krsna has saved you by causing your failure in the examination, otherwise you would have been more entrapped by the spell of this so-called "Krsna."

Krsna's further mercy upon you is exhibited that you are now living in our Temple. Our different centers are specially meant for reclaiming sincere souls to understand Krsna Consciousness, and if you are more serious about Krsna Consciousness then you should not only read our books and literatures with due care, but also if possible you should come here and live with me for some time.

You have mentioned about your dilemma between Krsna and your parents, and in this connection I may inform you that parents are available in any kind of birth. Either you take your birth as a human being or as an animal, there is a set of parents. But Krsna is available in the human form of body, so Krsna is more important than the parents. So do not miss the opportunity of your present human form of body. Try to understand Krsna, and make you life successful.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
