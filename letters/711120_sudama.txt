====== Sudama ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of November 4, 1971, and I am very pleased to hear that you have got some more devotees to assist you. Now you plot out a program with them how best to spread Krishna Consciousness in Japan. Our process is to infiltrate. We should not bother very much for their red tape, just rely on Krishna and by our determination everything will happen nicely according to His plan. These governments exist only for saying no, so I am not very optimistic that any government will ever help us.

Sankirtana means preaching, so for some time try in other ways to spread our Krishna philosophy anywhere and everywhere, by selling books, as many as possible, by holding kirtana and classes in schools and college---wherever there is preaching, that is Sankirtana. You have an American brain, now use it to think of new ways to preach in Japan.

As you have recommended, I am sending under separate parcel a set of initiation beads for Randy Prabhu, duly chanted on. His new name shall be Rama Dulal das Brahmacari. I am also sending one copy of Gayatri mantra and sacred thread duly chanted by me to Shatyananda das. Hold a fire yajna and give Gayatri to Shatyananda. If you do not have one, you can get a copy of a tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra from Karandhara. One thing is that the tape should be heard through earphones into the right ear. The fire yajna can be held for both devotees.

The plant which you sent me is not Tulsi devi. I have no special instructions concerning Dai Nippon at this time. I shall probably be coming there to Tokyo on my return to Los Angeles by late Spring, I will let you know the date as soon as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
