====== Letter to: Tradhis, Nagapatni ======

My dear Sriman Tradhis and my dear daughter Nagapatni Devi Dasi,

Please both accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil from our Los Angeles New Dvaraka Temple, and I am very glad that you have come to join our family of Krsna which is the original eternal, blissful family of all living souls as parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna. It is so much pleasing to me that you and many, many young boys and girls are finding that Krsna or Govinda is the only source of satisfaction and joyfulness for all living entities. Everyone is anxious after longevity and sense happiness, but they are all bewildered and frustrated until by the Grace of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu they come into this Sankirtana Movement which is the only right way for easily reviving our desired life of eternal bliss.

I am very glad to accept you both, husband and wife, as my initiated disciples. I have chanted your beads duly and they are returned to you herewith. Your spiritual names are Tradhis Das Adhikari and Srimati Nagapatni Devi Dasi. Your daughter may remain called as Janmastami devi and when she is initiated she shall receive a new name. I am just requesting you to become ideal example of Krsna consciousness in householder life and thus you will encourage so many others who come in your contact to adjust their lives to this sublime process. That in itself will be the greatest service. So please stay strong and stronger in devotional service to Krsna by chanting daily sixteen rounds of beads, following the regulative principles strictly and avoiding the ten offenses in the matter of chanting the Holy Names of the Lord. If you follow this simple process faithfully under the direction of your Spiritual Master and try to understand our philosophy by regular study, you will continue to progress your lives in Krsna Consciousness and Krsna will simultaneously protect you from the attacks of Maya and provide you with all necessary facilities for rendering service unto Him. Please take encouragement and guidance from your elder Godbrothers and sisters and happy in Krsna Consciousness.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
