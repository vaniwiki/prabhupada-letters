====== Damodara ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26 January, 1970 along with your check for $15.

I am so glad to learn that Mr. David Loomis has sponsored a center in the University of Maryland, and fifteen students are attending our Bhagavad-gita lectures. Please organize this center nicely and try to attract the student community.

You will be glad to know that Mr. George Harrison has contributed the entire cost of publishing __Krishna,__ and we are going to publish it very soon in Japan with various pictures. It is now in progress and in due course we will receive the books.

In the meantime, try to sell the books already printed as well as newly published "Isopanisad", and save some money for my book fund.

In every center they have got a car or truck, and they are going out in the street away from the temple to chant Hare Krishna---so you have got this opportunity now. Try to utilize it fully.

I hope this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
