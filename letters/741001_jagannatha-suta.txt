My dear Jagannatha Suta dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 12, 1974 with enclosed copies of issue No. 6 of the New World Harmonist. Simply to criticize what is gong on in the material world, what is the profit? Nature is working, and unless one is a devotee he will be disturbed by nature. __Daivi esa guna mayi/ mama maya duratyaya__ [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]]. The rascals are such that they do not even ask why they are suffering. So if we discuss the food shortage, what is the benefit for us?

A human being must put the question of why am I suffering. Animals also suffer but they have no sense to put the question of why. The materialists are trying to adjust the disturbances of nature in so many ways. But after so many attempts at adjustment have they been able to stop suffering? They are so rascal that still they are suffering after so many adjustments, and yet they do not ask why.

We must enquire for the solution. This is what we must discuss in the Harmonist. After all we have already got our Back to Godhead. Simply to discuss ordinary things, there are so many papers already discussing. Simply saying there is scarcity, that everyone knows. We must give the solution. I am not discouraging you. When you say that the solution is there in Srimad-Bhagavatam that is nice. But, what is the solution that you must give and thus render real service to the people. I think this style of paper will be easily taken by the people.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
