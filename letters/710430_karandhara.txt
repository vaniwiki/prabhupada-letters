My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. Yesterday night I received one telephonic call from you. I talked for a few seconds and then you stopped, so I could not understand why you called me. Anyway I think things are going on nicely there.

I am still in Bombay and am supposed to go to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia next Monday. I was supposed to go today but did not because my new passport was misdelivered by the post office. So I am trying to reserve my seat and probably will be going on Monday.

I think you have deposited the $5000 installment to my account as was previously informed. If so, please let me know. I shall issue a check to Advaita Prabhu, Iskcon Press. He wants $19,000 for printing Bhagavad-gita As It Is in large edition. So if you have not as yet deposited the money in the bank, then directly give it to Iskcon Press and instead of sending money to Dai Nippon, Bhaktivedanta Book Fund, for the time being go on sending all money to Iskcon Press for printing Bhagavad gita As It Is. When it is printed, say about 2000 copies should be sent to India and the balance should be distributed by you to USA and Europe. Henceforward the books and magazines should be distributed properly and money collected and spent for again reprinting the books. If Iskcon Press can print our books nicely, we have no business with going to Dai Nippon. I think because they have moved to a better place, the press work will go on nicely.

This day the whole day has been to me an anxious time because I have heard very bad news from Pakistan. In a local paper it is published that four of our Hare Krishna Movement Missionaries were killed in Dacca by the Pakistani soldiers. I am very much anxious to know about Brahmananda. I had advised Brahmananda not to go to Pakistan after the civil war began there but I am afraid that he was very daring and might have gone against my instruction. So I am very very much anxious to know about Brahmananda. The whole day has been full of anxiety and still it is going on. So if possible, inquire and let me know by telegram.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
