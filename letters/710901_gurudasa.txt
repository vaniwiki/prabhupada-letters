====== Gurudasa ======

Delhi

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far Indira Gandhi is concerned, I have replied that point in Tamala's letter enclosed. If you can arrange one meeting between her and myself that will be very nice.

Regarding Regent's Park, if Dr. K. Singh is a friend of Lord Mountbatten, he should write him one letter that we are a bona fide society, etc. and that we shall be calling upon him in the near future to help us in locating some land in London, and that he should please assist us in every way possible. His address is as follows:\\
Admiral of the Fleet\\
Earl Mountbatten of Burma;\\
c/o Mrs. Bachmann;\\
Broadlands; Romsey;\\
Hampshire 505 920/England

Ksirodakasayi will be reaching there by the middle of September. Your attempt for a pandal program sounds very encouraging. You are experienced now so I know that you will do it expertly. Thank you very much. Radio and television appearances are very nice. Also you can arrange for local house to house meetings for all your party. That will be nice program.

Please offer my blessings to Yamuna and all the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
