====== Kirtanananda ======

<card class="letter">
New Vrndavana

My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 6, 1973 and have noted the contents with great care and concern.

The deities may be immediately repaired and worshiped. Now we must take precaution as you have suggested. You may get some guns and some of the boys may be trained as ksatriyas. Such gun shots could have taken place long ago since we are challenging everybody. So we must be prepared to fight. We cannot stop this movement. It is actually a fight against Maya. So Maya may also sometimes cause casualties in our camp. So, we must only thank Krsna and seriously dedicate everything for Him. So, you are Kirtanananda Maharaja, take pleasure in performing kirtana. That is our real weapon against Maya.

I am very pleased that the corner stone function was nicely done and successful. Continue the work enthusiastically. Thank you very much for the check for $200.

I am slowly regaining my health. It is now the rainy season here and accordingly the digestive process is slowed down. Therefore the rainy season means slow recovery.

I was just thinking of you and wondering why I hadn't heard from you in a long time. You'll be pleased to know that your assistant Srutakirti is here. He's feeling all right. This boy appears to be a very sincere devotee.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept the devotees you have recommended for first and second initiation. You may chant on the beads of the first initiates and I am enclosing six sanctified sacred threads for the second initiates. Play the tape of me reciting gayatri mantra into the right ear of the brahmanas. The names of the first initiates are: Jim Hessler---Krpacarya das; Jack Mower---Kasyapa das; Chuck St. Dennis---Cakradhari.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. On top of the towers on the temple, you should make Visnu's colus (or cakra) and a flag.\\
