====== Yasasvini ======

Nairobi

My dear Yasasvini dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 10th and noted the contents. Thank you very much. Now my request to you is that you go on faithfully chanting daily 16 rounds at least and follow all our principles, and Krsna will help you advance in Krsna consciousness.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
