My dear Samjata dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 13 February, 1976 with enclosed daksina and I thank you very much. Now you must very strictly follow the orders of your spiritual master by chanting 16 rounds of japa daily and accepting the 4 restrictions; no illicit sex life, no intoxication, no gambling, and no meat-eating. In this way you will surely make progress in Krsna Consciousness.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
