====== Niranjana ======

Saugor, India

My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5th October, 1973, and I have noted the contents.

I am very glad to know that you have passed your examination and have been awarded a scholarship. There is no difficulty for arranging your accommodation and Prasadam in Glasgow, as we have got our branch there. When you go I shall personally give intimation to our Glasgow center. When you go there, try to preach. You have learned ho to speak English, so you can preach nicely. Always try to give some service, and that will make you successful.

I may be coming to New Delhi by the second week of November, so if possible you may try to see me there. We are conducting a large pandal from November 9th-18th at the most important area, LIC Grounds, Connaught Circle.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
