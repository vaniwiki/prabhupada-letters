My Dear Ishan, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 10, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the lease on the building, I think you may consult with Hansadutta in this matter and decide what is to be done. The description of the house sounds very nice, so if you agree to take the lease, I have no objection to this. Your suggestion about the householders all living there is also nice, and if this can be arranged, you should do it. Regarding the Krishna Consciousness film you have suggested, I do not know who will pay for the making of the film or what the film will be about. So before I can advise you I must know more specifically what you have in mind.

I have seen your daily schedule report and it is very nice. I am glad that you are always engaged in the service of Krishna. That is required. In the future you may continue to regulate yourself in this way, and there is no necessity of sending these reports to me on a regular basis. You have expressed a fear of becoming attached to your musical activities, but attachment for Krishna's service is not bad. If you can engage your talent for Krishna's service, then this attachment will increase your Krishna Consciousness status.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
