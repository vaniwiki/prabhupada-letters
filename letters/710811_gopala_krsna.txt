My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 8th August, 1971 as well as your Vyasa Puja offering, so nicely composed. I am sending it off to Satsvarupa for future publication.

Also I have received your very generous contribution of $200.00 for the Mayapur project; $150.00 by check and $50.00 by cash, delivered this morning by Nandarani Devi upon her arrival here. One thing is that in the future all checks should be made out to some American bank, so that it can be easily cleared and deposited in my account at Bank of America in Los Angeles.

The cloth, thermal underwear and pullover are also very nice and useful. Thank you once again.

I am so glad to hear that everything is well for you. Hoping you are in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
