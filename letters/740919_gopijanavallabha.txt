====== Gopijanavallabha ======

My dear Gopijanavallabha dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 30, 1974 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I am initiating the following disciples. You must see that they strictly follow the regulative principles, the four prohibitions as well as the devotional practices of arising early, taking morning bath, putting on tilaka, attending mangal arati, chanting japa 16 rounds, and attending Srimad Bhagavatam class. This is the duty of all my initiated disciples, whether they are big or they are small. Actually in our movement there is no such thing as big or small. Everyone is a devotee. So everyone is expected to follow the devotional practices. Here in Vrindaban I am enjoying my disciples how they are speaking. So two times daily everyone must attend the classes. During the morning and evening times there should be no business, simply kirtana, chant, dance, and be purified. Do not be paramahamsa that now I haven't got to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. Don't be a better paramahamsa than your Guru Maharaja. I go and sit and I enjoy the lectures and how they are performing kirtana. So as I am doing, you must also do.

Everyone can become a first class speaker. Simply cram the purports of my books. The references are there, the philosophy is there. Everything is there. So if you do it, everyone will be pleased with your speaking.

The names are: Avritt Brown (Alankara das); Conrad Joseph (Kundali das); Edward Kelly (Adarsi dasa); Richard Masla (Rasatala dasa); William Oliveres (Viprahita dasa); Glenn Covin (Gunabhrt dasa); Luis Martinez (Lokasaksi dasa); Andrea Martinez (Atapatrini devi dasi); Inge Graves (Isa devi dasi)

I am also accepting upon your recommendation Rasaraj and Indriyesa das as twice initiated brahmanas. Enclosed are the sanctified threads and a mantra sheet. See that they and all brahmanas say the gayatri mantra three times daily.

So hold a fire sacrifice and let them hear the mantra from my tape recording through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
