My Dear Shyamadasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your nice letter dated 23 January, 1970. Your poetic appreciation about my humble self goes directly to my Spiritual Master because I am His servant only. Although I have no capacity to assimilate all the nice things that you offer me, they are directly dispatched to my Spiritual Master who is worthy of accepting all nice things.

I am very glad to see that both you and your husband are a good combination. Everyone should be happy by your unique unity. Your husband is a learned scholar and you are a well qualified devotee wife. Now, by the Grace of Krishna you have a good husband, good association, good land, and good engagements. Similarly, you have got a very good atmosphere in Columbus. So be happy with all these, Krishna's gifts, and be advanced in Krishna Consciousness.

I thank you very much for your handkerchief which will be immediately engaged in the service of the Lord. It is so beautiful with lace edges.

I am so glad to learn that Columbus center is doing very well, and that sincere souls are being attracted there. Please decorate the new Deity room and altar as nicely as possible. I well remember your excellent chopatties, and I am happy to know that you are know preparing nice foodstuffs for the Deities.

If you all will spread this Samkirtan Movement, going on Samkirtan Party in the streets, regularly read our literatures and always keep engaged in Krishna Consciousness activities, you are sure to increase the joyfulness of your own lives and influence all others with whom you come in contact to join you in this program of going back to home, back to Godhead.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

My dear Hayagriva, I have advised Jananibas to submit his thesis for publication in BTG, so please do the needful.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
