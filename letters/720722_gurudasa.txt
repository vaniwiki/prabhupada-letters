====== Gurudasa ======

<card class="letter">
Vrndavana

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have recently received several letters from the others there in Vrndavana, wherein they have mentioned there may be some illicit relationship between Devananda Swami and your wife, Yamuna devi. I want to know if there is any substance to this claim, you may be frank and honest with me as much as possible because I am very much in anxiety on this account. Therefore I have asked Devananda to leave India for working as pujari in Nairobi. Also enclosed please find the copy of one letter from the accountant there in Vrndavana. The report is not very good, so you please give me your side of the situation and explain these things.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
