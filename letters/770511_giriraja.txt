====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

Bombay

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letters, both dated 8th May, 1977.

As Mr. Mohatta has recommended, I have enclosed a letter to Bank of America advising them to make payment to E.C.C. for the amount of Rs. 2 Lakhs. This letter as well as the other letter advising a transfer of Rs. 6 1/2 Lakhs to State Bank of Hyderabad account, should only be presented to Bank of America after they advise you that they have received Gurukrpa Swami's $100,000.00, and not before. But Mr. Mohatta should be shown all the bills so that he can check them. I am not at all in favor of paying them any more money until the final bill is presented.

Has I.O.B. began construction of their premises yet? Thank you for organizing the all day Sunday Kirtana program. This should be developed very nicely, stressing kirtana and prasadam.

Yes, my health is improving a very little. The house that we have been given is the best in Risikesh. It is very nice and the climate is much better than Bombay's. Many persons are coming in the afternoons for darsana. I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
