====== Bahulasva ======

My dear Bahulasva,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of November 15, 1971, and I am very much pleased that our Chicago center is doing very nicely under your supervision. You may request the Prof. E. Dimac and Prof. Van Buitenin to review and write a forward for our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ That is very nice. I am very glad that you understand the importance of these books. Let us try to distribute them far and wide, as many as possible, and that is solid spiritual information or real preaching work. We stand on our Krishna philosophy, and because it has the full potency of Krishna Himself, there is no limit to the effect it will have upon the world if we remain sincere and convinced for spreading this philosophy purely. I like your idea to publish many small books especially meant for the layman class. ISKCON Press has just printed "Topmost Yoga" and "Easy Journey", and you may order these from them. I have written and spoken ample stock for such articles and essays. Now it is up to our editors in N.Y. to select and publish them. Actually it was my original idea that our press should print many smaller books by the millions, but that they are not doing. Instead they talk of expanding more and more, but they cannot produce any big books. So you may approach Bhagavan das and Rupanuga with your suggestions for books, and among yourselves you just chalk out some practical plan.

The example regarding the Swami's argument is that God is the ocean and the living entities are waves. So accepting this argument we may say that the waves are being formed perpetually and again, and they are mixing with the sea water. So what is the question of liberation? That is the example in __Bhagavad-Gita.__ The whole material manifestation is generating and again vanishing. So we are not concerned with this kind of business. We are concerned to go deep into the sea and have our own individual identity exactly like the fish and other aquatic animals, and enjoy perpetually in the sea. This is liberation. This Mayavadi philosophy is very superficial, and therefore they cannot go deep into the matter and they are simply satisfied simply by suggesting the activity of the waves.

I am very glad that you are challenging all of these so-called swamis and gurus. My Guru Maharaja appreciated devotees who boldly present our Vaisnava philosophy. We must take advantage of every opportunity to defeat these rascals and drive them away, so please continue this strong attitude.

I shall be very glad to initiate anyone whom you recommend to become my disciple.

I hope this meets you, your good wife, and your sons, Yamal and Arjuna, in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
