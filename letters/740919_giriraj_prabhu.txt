====== Letter to: Giriraj Prabhu ======

Dear Giriraj Prabhu:

Please accept my humble obeisances. Ramesvar has written that Dollars 78,531.75 has been transferred from L.A. to Bombay American Express account. Please have this money transferred by Telegraphic Transfer to Punjab National Bank, Vrindaban Branch a/c No. 6685, ISKCON Savings Fund.

Ramesvar also informs that you have received there the equivalent of dollars 7,500 from Life Members, so this should also be sent by you here to Vrindaban is the some manner, He has deducted this amount from what he has transferred from Guru Kripa's collection.

I am also informed that you have received Rs. 50,000/- for a donation for Vrindaban project, so please arrange for this immediate transfer as well.

Are you having a spare key to Prabhupad's elmira (metal) in his bedroom? If so, the ms. of Madhya Lila is lying there and is needed by Nitai.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your servant,

Brahmananda Swami
