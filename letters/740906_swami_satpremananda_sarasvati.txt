====== Letter to: Swami Satpremananda Sarasvati ======

Sweden

Dear Swami Satpremananda Sarasvati:

Please accept my best wishes. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July, 1974 and have noted the contents and thank you for it. So far as initiation is concerned, it is best if you live in one of our temples for some time and follow the rules and regulations and chant Hare Krsna on the beads 16 rounds. Then upon recommendation of the temple president, you can be initiated.

Nowadays there are so many so-called spiritual masters, it becomes bewildering to us as to who can actually give spiritual knowledge. Therefore I have written volumes of books, authorized Vedic literature, of which you can take advantage in association with the devotees who are practicing this knowledge. Thus you will be able to learn the science of God.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
