Honolulu

My dear Shasta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25/10/76.

Regarding Sukadeva, it has been found that he has got a substantial amount of money in private bank accounts. Perhaps you do not know this. He has caused a great difficulty in the management of our Honolulu temple. Of course Gurukrpa has got to handle the situation nicely, but what can I do from here.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
