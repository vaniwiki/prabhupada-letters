====== Hasyakari ======

Washington D.C.

My dear Hasyakari das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 1, 1975 and have noted the contents. As for your going to Mayapur is concerned, that is a very good suggestion. But, it is best that you earn the money for the fare independently by doing Sankirtana.

Now Gurukrpa Swami and his men are working very hard to raise money for construction of our important projects in India. He has raised objection why his collections should be used for other purposes such as plane fare, etc.

Therefore it is best that you raise the money through your own efforts, even it may take a little longer. You are sincere in this endeavor, so Lord Caitanya will assist you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
