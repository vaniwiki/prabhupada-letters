My dear Hansadutta dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one telegram from Mahamsa Swami which reads as follows: MISSED YOUR GRACE BY HOURS AGREEMENT DRAFT FOR FARM LAND SENT TO YOU PLEASE SANCTION RS 30,000 URGENT TRANSFER TO PREPARE FOR UTILIZING THIS MONSOON---MAHAMSA SWAMI. So, they have agreed to our terms and made a draft agreement form which I have not yet seen. Anyway, as stipulated before, that you will come back to India after setting things up there in London and Frankfurt, the monsoon begins by the latest, July in that part of India, so you have to come back sometime in the month of June. And immediately, you have to send Mahamsa Swami 4,000 dollars. So, do the needful and be in correspondence with Mahamsa Swami at Hyderabad.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
