Columbus, Ohio

My dear Srimati Joanne and Connie,

Please accept my blessings. In continuation of my last letter, upon opening further the box sent by you along with your letters to me I have found the necklaces and handkerchief made by you for Sri Sri Radha and Krsna, and they are so wonderful. I have immediately got them on the Deities, and They are looking very gorgeous with Their new ornaments. So I beg to thank you very much for these nice gifts of your artistic talents.

In the meantime, I have received one letter from Sriman Jananivasa requesting your initiations from me. So on his good recommendation you may send me your beads for chanting and I will be very happy to initiate you both. Please always chant Hare Krsna mantra and be happy.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
