====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

Bombay

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much anxious to receive report of the Bombay activities, about construction and everything. Please send full report to my Hawaii address: 51 Coelho Way, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

We have got many enemies, especially our tenants. Therefore, things should be very carefully done. Whether the tenants union is legally alright and whether by their united action, they can encroach upon the rights of the landlord. We wanted to build up a wall and the tenants, by force, have broken the wall. Does it mean that the tenants unit can encroach upon the landlord's right? Have you formed any advisory committee of the persons we selected? I think the advisory committee should not be more than ten persons, very important from the list. The other day, I saw Mahadevia's attitude not in our favor, but in favor of the tenants, being influenced by Acarya. These things should be considered very carefully. For the time being, we have stopped the wall construction, but it was not at all congenial that the tenants broke the wall illegally.

Now, plans should be made how to utilize all the lands available. Sumati Morarji wanted some land for her school on lease. I think we shall negotiate with her on favorable terms. Things in the past were done very irregularly. Now, everything must be done very carefully and cautiously.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
