====== Balai ======

My dear Balai,

Please accept my blessings. After a long time I have received your letter and I thank you very much. I always think of you how nice, Krishna Conscious, beautiful girl you are. So Krishna has given you a nice daughter to take care of. Here, the daughter of Malati, Sarasvati, is giving us much pleasure in her Krishna Consciousness activities. She is so nice that as soon as there is chanting sound of kirtana immediately she begins to dance and clap. Even the audience becomes astonished and they follow her activities. It is very nice. I think your daughter may now be walking, so she may also be trained for dancing and clapping.

So attend Sankirtana Party very regularly. Kirtana is our life and soul, and the press is part of kirtana. So both of you, husband and wife, always remember this and try to execute both these ways of activities. I understand that Saradia has come back to Boston, living with Vaikunthanatha. This is nice. One thing you should know---of course, I know that you are so nice that there is no possibility amongst you for disagreement between husband and wife; but sometimes it happens---so you can let Saradia know that in our Krishna Consciousness household life there is no question of separation. Our marriage is Absolute. But if sometimes some disagreement is there, they may live separately for a few days, but that does not mean they can think of separation. Please try to educate all the girls in that way. In December I shall be there in Boston, and it shall be my great pleasure to see you all together.

Please offer my blessings to your daughter, Nandini. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
