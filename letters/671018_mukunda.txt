My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram reading as follows;

"Swamiji Now Filling third Preference Visa with Documents"

Today I have been to the American Consular office & upon presentation of the invitation letters from the different centers I was at once granted visitors visa under #B2. The officer whom I met was very sympathetic & he said that Immigration visa from this side would take a long time for being granted better I took the visitors visa---so I have accepted it. Now for the present you may not take any steps until my arrival. Tomorrow we shall get your tamboura. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta, Swami
