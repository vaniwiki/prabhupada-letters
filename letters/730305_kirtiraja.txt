====== Kirtiraja ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kirtiraja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of letter and plans for the new building dated the 14th of February. After some delays, I have just arrived here the day before yesterday.

I have examined the plans for the building on West 43rd Street just near the corner of 5th Avenue and I think it is perfectly suitable for us in every way. Please work together with Bali Mardan Maharaja and try your best to secure it.

Regarding Jadurani's question about the glue, yes she may use it if it is more practical for our purposes.

I shall be going to Mayapur by the 15th, remaining there up to the 22nd. I hope this meets you in good health. Hare Krsna!

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
