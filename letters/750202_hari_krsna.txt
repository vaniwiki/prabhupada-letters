====== Hari Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
Amsterdam

My dear Hari Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings, I am in due reciept of your letter dated January 18, 1975. I am glad to note that your Amsterdam center is improving and that new devotees are joining. Example is better than precept, so you follow the regulative principles, chant 16 rounds daily, attend morning and evening arati and as much as possible go for sankirtana distributing my books.

I have already written Puranjana, that whatever money is owed to the BBT that should be paid. You may continue to distribute records, providing a book is given with each record.

Do not manufacture records, but take from Germany. They are already doing so you take from them. Hansadutta is here with me now and other GBC members, they are consulting all problems and trying to relieve me of management, so in future you may consult with the local GBC and work co-operatively, that will give me relief for printing my books.

I hope this letter finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
