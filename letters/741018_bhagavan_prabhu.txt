====== Letter to: Bhagavan Prabhu ======

My dear Bhagavan Prabhu:

Please accept my humble obeisances. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 30, 1974 and have noted the contents. I have not received any telegram from you, but I understand that you will be coming in about a weeks time. Srila Prabhupad confirmed upon my suggestion that you go straight to Bombay first. In this connection Srila Prabhupad said the following: "So far I have studied there is a clique of some enemies to acquire the land and spoil the whole scheme. So we have to save ourselves. Even if there is no sanction to build further buildings, we should maintain what we have got. We should not let anyone infringe on our rights. The book distribution program must be thoroughly organized."

The threat is in relation to a road that is being built there. This you can study when you go there. Regarding the book distribution, Gargamuni Swami and Jayatirtha recently were sent to Bombay especially to organize the BBT there. They have made some suggestions.

I have brought to Srila Prabhupad's attention your remarks regarding Hansadutta's report of Paris, and he does not know why Hansadutta is meddling in Paris affairs. A neighboring GBC man can be called in for help, but if he gives the wrong report, what can be done?

I have already written you what things to bring. Most important is the small manual typewritter and the day/date wristwatch. For Sruta Kirti you can bring dates and granola and honey for his special diet.

I hope this meets you in good health. Have I seen the new copy of the French Ishopanishad?

Your servant,

Brahmananda Swami

Personal Secretary
