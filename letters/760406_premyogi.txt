My dear Premyogi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter of 3 April, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. If you are serious about serving Krishna, then remain with us for sometime to learn the transcendental art.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
