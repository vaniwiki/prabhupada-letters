====== Vamanadeva ======

St. Louis

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 29th March, 1970. The newspaper portion is very encouraging. They have devoted so much space for describing ourselves. Although there are a few misquotations, never mind, it is a good publicity.

I am so much pleased with your wife and yourself and I can simply praise you how wonderful you are. Both you and your wife are setting good examples how Krsna Conscious Grhasthas or householders should live for Krsna. You are practically experiencing that there is no difficulty in household life if people are in Krsna Consciousness. So please stick to your principles very nicely and the program which you are following is already very nice---lecturing in the university, having classes in your apartment, distributing Prasadam---all of them are very, very nice. Please offer my blessings to Indira, and go on with your program, and Krsna will give you all opportunities.

We have purchased a new church building here, and you will be glad to see the picture enclosed herewith. So gradually in your center also one day we may have our own buildings because everything is possible if Krsna desires.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
