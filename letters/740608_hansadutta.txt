====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings.

Syamasundara has voluntarily suspended his responsibility as GBC and I am enclosing my letter to him in this regard. So you may continue as GBC. So I have asked Syamasundara to tell the others to cooperate and I am sure this will alleviate all party feeling.

We have to keep Krsna always in the center, and then although there are disturbances and sometimes fall downs we will be able to work together and keep our society intact. Some people recommend that in the face of so many nasty thoughts which occur in material thinking, we should try to become "thoughtless", but this is never possible. Our Krishna Consciousness principle is not to become thoughtless but to purify the thinking to always thinking of Krishna. So try to spread and encourage this philosophy of thinking of Krsna, after thoroughly assimilating it yourself.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have accepted for initiation the devotees recommended by you and their new spiritual names are as follows:\\
Matthew Norton---Manihara dasa\\
Ann Norton---Amekhala devi dasi

You may chant on their beads.

So we are awaiting your sending us plane tickets so we may leave on the 16th June for Frankfurt, Germany.\\
