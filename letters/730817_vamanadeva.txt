====== Letter to: Vamanadeva ======

Florissant, Missouri

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 12, 1973, and I have noted the contents. I am referring your letter to Satsvarupa Goswami since he is the GBC Secretary for your zone. I have made him in charge of Gurukula so he is competent to answer your question, please write to him in matters of management

I hope that you are feeling well. Please offer my blessings to your good wife Indira dasi.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
