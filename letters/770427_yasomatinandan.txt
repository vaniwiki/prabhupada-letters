My dear Yasomatinandan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 22nd, 1977 which has arrived here on the 26th instant.

By the time this letter reaches you the installation ceremony will have already been performed and the initiation for the brahmanas must have already taken place. The invitation card is nicely done and it must have been a very successful ceremony Now that you have welcomed Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai to Ahmedabad, you must take care of Their Lordships very nicely. The key to Deity worship is regularity and cleanliness. Everything must be offered on time to Their Lordships, and everyone who serves Them as well as everything prepared for Them must be very clean. Please personally see that Sri Sri Gaura-Nitai are given all attention. By getting Their blessings, you will become Krsna conscious and everyone else who you come into contact with will also.

Regarding Jesus Christ, unfortunately he could not meet such nice devotees as I have met. Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, but their first business was to kill him. And still this killing is going on. In that sense I am very fortunate to have assistants like you.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
