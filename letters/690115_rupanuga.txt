====== Rupanuga ======

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I was very much anxious to receive your letter since I did not hear from you for a long period. But I always know that you are doing your duty nicely. Recently, Hayagriva came from Columbus, and he remained with me for more than a fortnight. He was assisting me in editing __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ Now he is married with Syama Dasi and has returned to New Vrindaban with his many responsibilities.

I am glad to learn that you have been helping this boy, Kenneth, and he is now eager to be initiated. So, as recommended by you, I have agreed to initiate him and call him Kanupriya das Brahmacari. Please take care of him and give him impetus to rise more and more in Krishna Consciousness.

Regarding the draft problem, I am enclosing a certificate which I have issued to many students, and I think that this will be effective. Within a few days we will have prepared official certificates for both you and Kanupriya which will certify that you are duly initiated disciples of this Krishna Consciousness movement.

Please try to introduce the reading of the __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ in your university where you shall be teaching. I understand that some rubbish commentaries upon __Bhagavad-gita__ are allowed to be studied in every university, so if you can replace our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ it will be a great advancement for our missionary activities, and people will thereby be benefited.

Please convey my blessings to all others in Buffalo temple. I hope this finds you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
