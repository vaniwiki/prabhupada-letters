My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram dated 14th August, 1970 and reading as follows:---will send Hindi BTG by 14 special delivery should reach you on 16 or 17 your eternal servant uddhava das isokrishna boston. However until today there has been no arrival of the Hindi BTG, so I am still waiting for it.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
