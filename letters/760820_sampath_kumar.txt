====== Sampath Kumar ======

Hyderabad

Dear Sampath Kumar,

Please accept my blessings. I am pleased to thank you for your kind help in organizing the Pratistha Yajnas for the opening ceremonies of the Sri Sri Radha-Madana-mohana Temple in Hyderabad.

The Yajnas were conducted very nicely and everything was very clean and neat. Actually in the Kali yuga the real yajna is the sankirtana yajna as it is prescribed in the Srimad-Bhagavatam,

> krsna varnam tvisakrsnam
> sangopangastra parsadam
> yajnaih sankirtana prayair
> yajante hi sumedasah
> [SB 11.5.32]

This is the sacrifice for Kali-yuga, harinama sankirtana.

My request is that you should help us to spread this Krsna conscious brahminical culture over the world.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
