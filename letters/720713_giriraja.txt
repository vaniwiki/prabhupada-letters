====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

Bombay

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 6, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I am pleased to hear that everything is progressing nicely there in Bombay. As for Srimati and Madri, they shall not be going to Africa. Brahmananda mentions that several other boys want to go to Africa from Bombay. Why this restlessness? If you so much require their services in India, why they should whimsically go away? It is better if they stay to help you there.

So far the flats, yes, Rs. 80/- per sq. ft. should be the price. Rs. 100/- is the standard rate for that neighborhood, so our price is not too high. So far Lalita Krishna is concerned, I have received one letter from Purusottama das Brahmacari requesting to travel to Malaysia with Lalita Krishna for opening some centers there. So best thing is to open centers in Malaysia and Singapore, recruit many Chinese-speaking devotees, translate our books into Malaysian and Singapore language, then with a party go to China later on. Regarding the boys you have recommended, their letter of initiation is enclosed and beads are sent under separate post.

Life Member means Life Member, there is no inheriting by the eldest son. It is only Rs. 1111/-, what is that?

Why you shall send Mayapur a monthly allowance? The plan was that Calcutta or Tamala Krishna was to maintain Mayapur. How is it Calcutta is not sending collections to Bombay? Unless they send their collections you cannot pay them anything. Bhavananda and yourself, you consult and do the needful. Why everything is referred to me? I instructed that Calcutta should support Mayapur. Otherwise what is the use of maintaining such big establishment in Calcutta?

So far Saurabha's idea to concentrate on the temple building, that is accepted.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
