Hyderabad

My dear Mahamsa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 5, 1975 and have noted the contents. So Gaura Govinda Maharaja has to go to Orissa to get that land in Bhunesvara, so I have given him the documents for necessary action. Unless he is absolutely required in Hyderabad he may go there with the other Orissa devotee. I have seen his Orissa literature about our movement and it appears to be very nice, any common man can understand it, and it is set up very nicely. He is very much hopeful to sell our books there amongst the higher class. I have already given him all instructions how to organize a center there. So I wish that he may go there and do his best to show his ability.

You have taken a loan from me to the extent of 2 laks but I think you have not returned even a part of this. So kindly send me as statement of accounts. I require a huge amount for the Kuruksetra project, not less than one crore, so now I wish to get it back.

By 15th December I will be in Bombay, so you can reply this letter to the Bombay address.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
