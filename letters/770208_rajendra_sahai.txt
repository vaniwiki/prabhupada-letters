Dear Rajendra Sahai,

Please accept my blessings. I have already written you inviting you to attend our Gour Purnima observance at Sree Dham Mayapur. (We begin observance at the end of February, up through the 5th of February). I am very interested in the Sri Beni Madhava Temple. I have also written the Mahant Sri Omkar Giri inviting him to Mayapur for further discussion on this. For yourself, I again invite you, and we will be prepared to pay for your expenditures.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
