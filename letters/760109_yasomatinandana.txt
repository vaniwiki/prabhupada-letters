====== Yasomatinandana ======

Ahmedabad

My dear Yasomatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 3rd January, 1976 and I have noted the contents carefully.

I have sent you a telegram reading as follows: "Gandhi asrama house useless Letter follows." As described by you, there are so many disadvantages of that building. Therefore, forget it. We are not at all interested in it. The entire structure would have to be dismantled.

The other house which you describe sounds very nice. You can accept the offer immediately and begin living there. You say they are prepared to give it for a good cause. What is more public welfare than Krishna Consciousness? To awaken everyone's original consciousness is the best public welfare in the whole world. So occupy this house and show some good work and in this way they may be induced to let us stay. Even if you can only stay for three months, what is the loss? You can always look for another place. Now people are seeing how genuine our movement is, they are coming forward to offer us so many places. We simply have to maintain our strict principles, keeping ourselves pure, Otherwise, there are so many bogus institutions doing business in the name of God and simply cheating the people. We have to be careful not to degenerate like these others. Our strength depends upon regular chanting the required 16 rounds and rigidly adhering to the regulative principles.

Regarding Dr. Ashok's address, my secretary shall be sending it to you by separate post.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
