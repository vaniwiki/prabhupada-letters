====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for sending me a record player by air freight, but since you have not mentioned that it is an unsolicited gift, customs has raised objections & they want to levy duty to the extent of 100 Rs. Please immediately send a letter addressed to Calcutta Customs stating that the record player was sent to me as an unsolicited gift. Send the letter to:

S.K. Dutta, 76 Durga Charan Doctor Rd., Calcutta, 14. Also please let me know if I should start on the visitors visa or whether I should wait for your permanent visa arrangement.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
