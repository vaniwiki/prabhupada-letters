My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 22nd, 1970, and I am sorry to learn that although you are so sober you have been disturbed by your married life.

Married life does not mean that there will be no disagreement between husband and wife---that is a custom from time immemorial. According to Vedic system, disagreement or quarrel between husband and wife should never be taken very seriously. The Vedic system therefore gives a concession for the wife to separate from her husband for some time and go to her father's house. So Cintamani may come to me for some time, but you cannot deviate from your responsibility in Japan. If so desired, Kartikeya Maharaja and Bruce can go immediately to help you, so arrange for their passage and I shall send them back. I think Bruce has got his return ticket.

Do not be diminished in your enthusiasm. You should always think of yourself that you are sold to Krsna as slave and that is the only way to get relief of the slavery of Maya. I hope you will understand me rightly and do the needful. May Krsna help you always.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. At present I am in Surat on the 4th Jan. 71. I am going to Bombay, from there I shall go to Calcutta on the 5th evening by plane, on the 7th there is an important meeting in Calcutta. Our present Calcutta address is 11b Jatindra Mohan Avenue c/o Goendha, Calcutta. Please immediately let me know by wire to Calcutta address whether KRSNA Vol: II has been shipped already or not. I am very anxious about it.

If you so desire the whole Sankirtana party in India may go to Japan as you say there is good prospect.
