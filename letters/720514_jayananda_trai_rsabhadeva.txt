====== Jayananda, Trai, Rsabhadeva ======

<card class="letter">
San Francisco

My dear Jayananda, Trai, and Rsabhadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated May 9, 1972, and have noted the contents carefully. I have no objection to any of the points mentioned therein by you. Only thing is, we must try to avoid becoming too much overly organized like the material businessmen. Our business is to ourselves become Krishna conscious, advance in spiritual life, and to preach to others how they can also take advantage and come to the perfectional stage of life. Too much business or paperwork, vouchers, plans, these things become too much cumbersome for our spiritual growth, they take us away from our real emphasis of work, namely, to go back to Home, back to Godhead. But I think your plan is not like that, so far I can see. It is practical and to the point. But now you must do it very nicely and complete it. Not that we make some plan, change things, then do not complete it, again change, this way, that way---no. There was some plan by Kesava to purchase a new San Francisco temple in a better part of the city. What happened to that plan?

I shall be coming to Los Angeles by Thursday, May 18th. So we shall discuss later. When I shall come there, I shall be glad to give sannyasa order to Jayananda, as Kesava has recommmended.

Hoping this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
