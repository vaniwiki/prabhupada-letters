====== Govinda ======

My dear Govinda dasi,

Please accept my blessings. Sudama Goswami has relayed to me the news of his conversation with you recently. We require just now huge sums of money for our projects in India so I request that you send the check for $20,000.00 to me in Los Angeles by registered post.

Furthermore, please come here to Los Angeles or return to the Temple in Hawaii. Karandhara and Sudama goswami are prepared to help you in every way. Your husband has gone away so what can be done. But you should return to our Temple and again take up devotional service as I have designed and directed at our Centers.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
