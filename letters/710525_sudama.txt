====== Letter to: Sudama ======

Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7th May, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So even though you are there by yourself, I can understand that things are going on nicely. And the Japanese boys and girls are taking a more responsible role in order to help you out. That is very encouraging. And soon Bhanu and Kartikeya Maharaja will be there to assist you. You will be glad to know that Bhanu is now a complete devotee, that is to say he has received Gayatri mantra. So when he goes there both you and him can convert many young Japanese people to becoming Krishna Conscious devotees.

I understand that you are needing one tape recording of Sri Isopanisad mantras, so I am recording them and they will be sent by separate post. You should be receiving it soon.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and eager for Krishna's service.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
