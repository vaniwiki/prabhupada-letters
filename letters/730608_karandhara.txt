====== Karandhara ======

<card class="letter">
Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5/31/73 and have noted the contents.

Yes, in Mayapur I am much improved from how I was in Los Angeles. The great advantage here is that there is always open air and a good breeze which is naturally very good for any breathing difficulties. The coughing is almost gone, but still sometimes at night it gives a little trouble. So I am under the treatment of one of the best physicians in Calcutta. I am taking this medicine and am gradually improving. Certainly Mayapur is by far a better place than Los Angeles because you can enjoy the free air here. The climate is not too hot, but a little moist with humidity but on the whole it is very pleasing. Our building is most superexcellently situated, and it is the experience of many respectable outsiders that while the outer atmosphere is unbearably hot, in our building it is pleasing.

Regarding your taking sannyasa, I think you are already a sannyasi although not in saffron colored cloth. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said,

> anasritah karma-phalam
> karyam karma karoti yah
> sa sannyasi ca yogi ca
> na niragnir na cakriyah
> [[books:bg:6:1|(Bg. 6.1)]]

"The Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work."

So, I know you'll take sannyasi sooner or later but wait for the time when Krsna will decide for this action.

You have written nothing about the $25,000 check which I left with you. Whether it is cashed and the business done? I advised Syamasundara to send you a check for $10,000. Whether you have received it? If not you can advise me. I am anxious to know whether that M-V Trust business (house purchase) is complete.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
