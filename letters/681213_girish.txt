====== Girish ======

My dear Girish,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of November 30, 1968 and have noted the contents with pleasure.

So far as your question about the Krishna stories, you will be glad to know that soon we will begin working on a book called, "KRISHNA" which will have stories and illustrations of all of Krishna's Pastimes. These stories come from the 10th canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam. You have also written that you wish to obtain some pictures of Krishna in his childhood and such pictures can be obtained by writing to Brahmananda in New York about prices and which pictures he has available.

I think that now that you are going to public school that you must study hard especially keeping in mind to learn how to read and write and do arithmetic. Perhaps after the summer we will have our own school in New Vrindaban and you will be a student there. But in the meantime, try to acquire these skills. They shall be a great asset to you in reading our literature and so many other services. So now that you are in school, you may make the best of it and become expert in these abilities.

Thank you again for your nice letter and I hope that you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
