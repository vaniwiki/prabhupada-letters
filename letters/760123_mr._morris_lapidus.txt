My dear Morris,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 5th, 1976. I am forwarding your letter to His Holiness Madhudvisa Swami who I have sent to New York to organize things. You may meet with him.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
