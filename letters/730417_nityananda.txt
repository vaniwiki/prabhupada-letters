====== Nityananda ======

My dear Nityananda Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 14, 1973 and was very pleased to read of your Sankirtana book distribution results. That you are sending good amount to the BBT even you have smaller size temple is much appreciated by me. I am very much pleased how all you disciples are distributing my books. Just now Karandhara has informed me that he is printing new editions of Krishna Trilogy, Sri Isopanisad, and NOD, all 100,000 copies each, and Krishna hardback sets, 50,000. So I am very much engladdened by this news. My Guru Maharaja used to be very much pleased whenever there was book distribution. So you just continue it solidly, that is my request.

Yes, you can install Gaura Nitai Deities in your temple . . Just now we are ordering very nice first class murtis three feet high from Philippines. They will cost $50.00 per set plus shipping. So we can supply you from Los Angles.

Enclosed is one brahmana gayatri mantra sheet for second initiation of Debraja Dasi. Now you show her how to count on the fingers, and have fire sacrifice, and she can hear the tape through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
