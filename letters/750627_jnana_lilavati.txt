My dear Jnana das and Lilavati dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 16, 1975 hand delivered by Brahmananda Swami. So now that you are married you work together to spread Krsna consciousness. Marriage means that one's service becomes doubled, but at the same time we have to be very careful not to fall into sense gratification. That tendency is there, and we have to be always vigilant. Best thing is to chant carefully our 16 rounds on the beads and always think of Krsna.

Brahmananda Swami has given me a good report of the African program, so you two as man and wife make our movement solid there. This I want.

I hope this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
