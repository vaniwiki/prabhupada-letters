====== Brahmananda ======

Nairobi, Kenya

My dear Brahmananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your GBC report dated December 26, 1973.

It is good news that you are now 14 strong at Nairobi. It will be nice if Shakti Mata can take care of the girls in the Temple. She is a very able woman. One thing, though, women should live separately. I know you can do it there because you have ample space.

Train the Negro devotees to speak Swahili and many will join you. They will be very attracted to your program of halava distribution, chanting and dancing and they will join you.

Yes, if we have too much money then unwise spending enters. You have just enough to get by and you are therefore having to spend wisely.

What has happened to my case with the immigration department? Has no action been taken? This is not good. Please reply on this point.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
