Los Angeles

My dear Danavir das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 27, 1974 and am very glad to read the nice report of the activities there. Jayatirtha was just here, and he also gave a nice report. I wanted that you Americans use your talents in spreading this cult, and I can see that you are doing that. In all departments you can use your talents and thus do the greatest benefit for the entire world. So my mission has come out a success by the mercy of my guru maharaj who sent me on this mission. That was my only qualification in coming to your country, that I had the blessings of my guru maharaj.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
