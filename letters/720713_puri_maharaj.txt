====== Letter to: Puri Maharaj ======

7, Bury Place,

London, W. C. 1,

England.

My dear Puri Maharaj,

Please accept my humble dandabats. I understand that the Rs. 1000/= has already been sent to you on or about June 8, 1972. I hope you have received it safely, and that you are doing the needful. I shall be very glad to hear from you what is the progress.

Now we are in London for holding our 4th annual Rathayatra Festival of Lord Jagannath. The procession will begin from Marble Arch and finish in Trafalgar Square, where I shall be speaking to more than 10,000 persons and holding fire yagna. Simultaneously, my disciples will be holding similar Jagannath Rathayatra Festivals in San Francisco, Tokyo, Philadelphia, Melbourne (Australia), and in Calcutta.

Thanking you, and I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
