====== Turya ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Turya dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 29th January 1973 and I have examined the contents carefully. Your project for a Temple sounds all right to me, and even if you don't get that particular building, Radha-Krsna Deities are approved for the present Temple. Of course, I want that you can work out all these kinds of details with Karandhara, your GBC secretary.

Yes, the name Gokulananda for your new son is approved by me, now raise this Sankirtana man up very carefully in Krsna consciousness. Now you can be an ideal householder and one of our Society's leaders, so kindly follow the regulated principles strictly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
