<card class="letter">
Allston, Mass.

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 23, 1968, and I have noted the contents. I am very much pleased to hear of your good success in the park on Sunday. This is very much encouraging to me, to hear so many people are hearing the chanting, and philosophy, and also taking nice prasadam as well. Yes, it is very good, and you please continue with this sort of program! This system should be followed and you will be successful. Because in New York also Hansadutta is following this system, holding Kirtana at Central Park every day, and he is collecting in the same way. All together he is collecting 50 to 70 dollars by contribution and by selling Back To Godhead. This is actually our successful propaganda. We want to distribute our literature and books within as well as our prasadam, and injecting our Hare Krishna medicine within the ear. So, reading of the literature and hearing of the chanting is the medicine, and prasadam is the diet. So, if diet and medicine are properly administered the disease of maya will be cured. But the physician must be always healthy. People may not say, physician is ill thyself. That means the preachers must be of highly elevated character, following strictly the rules and regulations and chanting regularly in the temple. There may be so many odds in the progressive march of Krishna Consciousness, but if we pin our faith in Krishna, everything will come out successful in due course.

Yes, Krishna didn't like that place, for $350, so you could not acquire it.

Please convey my blessings to Jadurani, Madhavi Lata, and Devananda. You are all good souls; please work together combinedly for spreading Krishna Consciousness there in that city. Hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
