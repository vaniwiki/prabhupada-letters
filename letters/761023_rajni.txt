====== Rajni ======

My dear Rajni dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5/10/76.

Yogesvara is supposed to come there very soon to check on the situation and then report back to me. You may please keep in correspondence with him.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
