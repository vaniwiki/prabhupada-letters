====== Hayagriva ======

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter of the 24th instant and have noted the contents. Regarding Gitopanisad I have already informed to send the manuscript one copy to the following address namely

__To Sri Hitsaran Sharma C/o Dalmia Enterprises, Scindia House, Connaught place, New Delhi-1.__

I have arranged everything for the printing and so you will kindly arrange to send one copy of the manuscript without delay finished or unfinished. Whatever is to be done further in this connection I shall manage to do it personally and also fill up the missing stanzas of the 9th chapter. Please therefore send it immediately. __One copy must remain there.__ You need not send the Mss all together but send them part by part as they are finished. I hope you will follow the instruction.

Kirtanananda Swami prearranged with you to reach on the 24th instant but he arranged here with me that he would stop at London and I gave him one important introduction letter. Although he had in his mind not to stop at London and yet promised before me that he would go, for which I gave him extra $20.00. I cannot understand why he played with me like this. If he had no desire to go to London he would have plainly told me like that. It has certainly given me a great shock. He is one of my very faithful disciples and if he does like that how can I prosecute my programmes. I have received one post card from him from London Airport in which he writes that he is going directly to N.Y. I understand also from Umapati's letter that he has already reached New York although I have not heard anything from him from New York. It is all my misfortune.

I am so glad to learn that you have secured a nice job. Please accept it and do the job very faithfully and try to inject Krishna consciousness amongst the students. I hope the Dentist's business with you has successfully been done. Your plan for starting an Indian philosophical society amongst your students is very good for propagating Krishna consciousness. Wherever you may remain please do not forget Krishna Kirtana and it will do good to you and your friends. Now I am quite fit to start for your country. The best thing would have been to go this time with a permanent Visa. Kirtanananda met the U.S.A. Consul general and he knows what to do in this connection. If I go with a permanent Visa it will be very nice for me. Please do the needful in cooperation with your other god brothers as also Mr. Nehru the Ambassador whom Brahmananda might have met by this time.
