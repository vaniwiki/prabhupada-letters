====== Letter to: Mr. N. N. Bagai ======

N. N. Bagai\\
1185 Sector 18-G\\
Chandigarh

My dear Mr. Bagai,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 30th, 1974 and have noted the contents. You have now got you identity card, so you can go if you like to any of our centers and live there for some time. If you like the atmosphere, then we have no objection to accept you into our institution. You should remain with us for some time, otherwise how will we know what work you are fit to do? You should understand of course, that we do not pay anyone in our society. After you have stayed with us for some time, then we shall discuss initiation, name and mantra. These things are not awarded immediately. When you take sannyasa, you can use the word svami---not before.

We are not interested in these things like hatha-yoga and swimming. We do not encourage such useless activities. We would never take to such activities for earning money. We get money enough. We don't require to adopt any unauthorized means. At present we spend 8 lakhs of rupees every month and Krishna sends all money. Our process is to chant Hare Krishna. That is sufficient.

You are welcome to Vrndavana anytime.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami
