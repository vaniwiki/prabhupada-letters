My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 17th, 1975.

As you report that things have deteriorated in Africa, you can stay there if necessary. Your decision to send Dinanatha to join Tamala is a good idea. Tamala is here now. He says that before coming he telegrammed you to phone him but there was no response.

The first business is that the GBC must see to the management of their zones. Still, I require a permanent secretary. In addition, one GBC man may come and go.

Here we have been given a nice piece of land measuring nine acres. The local people are very enthusiastic and the plan is to construct a Radha Krishna Temple complex.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

(What about Navayogendra?)

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
