====== Tamala Krsna ======

Bombay

My dear Tamala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I have duly received two express delivery letters jointly signed by you. Fortunately, yesterday evening the chief minister of Assam, Sriman Mahendra Mohan, came to see me and I have requested him to write a letter to Mr. Naik, the chief minister of Maharastra. He has promised to write a letter immediately to Mr. Naik. I hope this will be advantageous for your purpose. Mr. Mahendra Mohan has promised to send me a copy of the letter he is going to send to Mr. Naik.

Hope this finds you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
