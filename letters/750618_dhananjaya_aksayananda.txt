====== Dhananjaya, Aksayananda ======

Vrndavana

My dear Dhananjaya and Aksayananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7th June, 1975 and have noted the contents. You can go on offering ten plates. In the Radha-Damodara temple, the offer Bhoga to the Six Goswamis. Offer ten full plates, 8 puris, 2 kacoris, 2 samosas, varieties of sweets (2 each), and varieties of vegetables. Make many palatable things such as Jhuri, Dhal-mot, Jalebis, Rauta and many other nice dishes. You can keep a nice stock of these things, so that when a big man comes you can give him a nice plate of free prasada. In this way, our temple will become very popular, because everyone will know that if they come to our temple, they will receive very nice prasada. For the other guests, continue to sell the prasada daily. This is very nice program. Make all the prasadam very first class.

Regarding Tulasi devi in the courtyard: For the time being, put one stone pot in each corner and when I come there I shall see if any other thing is to be done in that connection.

In Delhi, the Home Member, Mr. Brahmananda Reddi, has promised me that 50 of our members will be allowed to stay as permanent residents. He said it may take a little time to arrange, but Tejyas can see him.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
