====== Letter to: Upendra ======

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters of March 20 and 21, 1969. I have noted the contents carefully. You should change your habits. You have lost now a good soul, and either he comes back or if you know his address then if he does not like to live with you, he may come at once and live with me personally. And you should try to check such passion. I think Jivananda and Harsarani also left for this reason. So the Seattle branch is in your charge, so as head of the temple you should be so nicely dealing with your assistants. Never mind now whatever is done is done, but in the future you should be very careful and do your duty with full faith in Krishna. Surely Vilasavigraha will come back, so when he comes back you can send him to me wherever I may be.

Regarding your Draft Board questions: We are trying at the moment to get our society recognized by them as a bona fide religious institution, and if this is successful, rest assured that there will be no trouble for you. Kartikeya has been classified in 4D ministerial status, because the officer who came to inquire about him was satisfied, but his instance is not generally recognized. We have to submit our bona fides and as soon as we get recognized then everyone of our boys will be saved.

In the meantime, you do your duty of management of Seattle branch faithfully, and I hope this will meet you in good health. And please let me know when Vilasavigraha returns; I shall be glad to hear.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
