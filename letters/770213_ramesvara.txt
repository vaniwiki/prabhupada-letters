====== Ramesvara ======

Dear Ramesvara Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings.

I have received a very favorable testimony of our Movement from the President of Indian Brain Research Association, Department of Biochemistry, University of Calcutta, Professor J.J. Ghosh. Dhira Krsna das, who obtained this letter writes that he has sent you the original. This will help us, and therefore I want it printed in prominent newspapers, even if we have to pay them to print it as and advertisement. Papers like the __San Francisco Chronicle__ and __Los Angeles Times__ should carry it. Please do the needful.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
