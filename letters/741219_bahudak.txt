My dear Bahudak,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Dec. 3, 1974 and have noted the contents.

The pictures of your newly installed Deities are very very nice. And you can name them Sri Sri Radha-Madan Mohan. The Deity worship should be done very carefully and nicely. __Sri-vigraharadhana-nitya-nana, srngara-tan-mandira-marjanadau, yuktasya bhaktams ca niyunjato'pi, vande guroh sri-caranaravindam.__ You should make sure that there is nice arati program; six arati daily at least. You should make sure that there is nice fresh, clean dress every morning, nice bathing ceremony every morning, nice offerings of prasadam. You should see that the Deity is tended for and cooked for only by the duly second initiated brahmanas. The Deity should have nice flowers everyday etc., etc. You should try to bring Them up to the highest standard, such as we have in Los Angeles or New Vrndavana. Sri Sri Radha-Madan Mohan have kindly descended in Their arca vigraha form now you must receive Them with that consciousness. And by serving Them you will all develop pure love of Krsna.

Thanking you for helping me in my mission. Occasionally send me report of how things are going on there. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
