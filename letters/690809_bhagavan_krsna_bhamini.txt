====== Bhagavan, Krsna Bhamini ======

My dear Bhagavan das and Krishna Bhamini Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I thank both of you very much for your letter of August 5th, 1969, and I have noted the contents with pleasure. Krishna has been very kind upon you, and if you continue to engage seriously in His service, certainly He will give all facilities. After all, it is His business that we are doing. It is very encouraging that you have had thirty people at your feast and twenty people at your first kirtana. It appears that Detroit has very good prospects for spreading Krishna Consciousness. Try to sell __Back To Godhead__ as much as possible. This is very nice propaganda work, plus it will provide you with some income for increasing activities further. I am enclosing herewith one book review of our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ and __Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ and this may help you to distribute these books nicely in the Detroit area. If you require more copies of this review, please inform me and I shall have them sent to you directly. Regarding the reporters who are interested in doing an article on your activities for the local paper, give them good points. I am also enclosing an article by Hayagriva das, called "The Hare Krishna Explosion," and this will give them more idea of our movement.

So far as Hansadutta and Himavati are concerned, at present they are organizing in Berkeley, but when they are finished there they may be willing to join you in Detroit. In the meantime, if there is any difficulty, or if you need men, you can consult with Tamala Krishna in Los Angeles, and he will help you. Regarding Gargamuni, yes, you may contact him. I have no objection.

I hope this will meet you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
