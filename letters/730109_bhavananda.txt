====== Letter to: Bhavananda ======

Calcutta

My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 4, 1973, along with the check for airplane fares to Calcutta. When he has booked the flight, Syamasundara will inform you when we are arriving. So far the marriage proposal between Madhavananda and Kausalya, enclosed please find a copy of one letter I have sent to GBC men in that connection. Henceforward these matters of marriage between the devotees must be decided upon by the GBC men and other senior members by their mutual consultation. So in this case you consider with other GBC and senior men. These things should be decided by our elderly members, not I should be involved so much with matters of husband and wife. You may send the report what programs you have arranged for me in Calcutta.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
