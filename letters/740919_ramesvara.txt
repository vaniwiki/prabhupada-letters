My dear Ramesvara Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 10, 1974 with enclosed report of the BBT Loan Accounts. Your resignation will be placed before the GBC meeting at Mayapur and a decision will be taken at that time. I hope in the meantime you will come to your real condition of mind. Your duty is to carry out my orders. There cannot be any question of resignation. If anyone surrenders to Krishna wholeheartedly and engages in His service he cannot say later on I resign. It is not something like material service. Once surrendered, it cannot be withdrawn.

So never mind. Don't be agitated. Any complaint may be put before the GBC meeting. In the meantime go on with your duties. That is my request.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have received your letter dated August 5, 1974 with enclosed letter from the Macmillan editor, but this biography is not very important.\\
