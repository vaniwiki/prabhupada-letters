====== Letter to: Karandhara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated 20th ansd 29th September, 1970. I have also just received the three sets of color photos of our L.A. Temple and they are very beautiful. Thank you very much for them.

The Deity worship should be done just in the way it was carried out in my presence. You should see that such a high standard is maintained and that there are no irregularities. Irregularity means breaking the schedule. As you have mentioned those thrones that are coming, I was just thinking of them. When they are fixed up, please send me photos of them. Please continue to send as much as possible to my bookfund deposit. I have received a copy of the monthly payments from the temple sent by you, but as of yet I have not received a copy showing payment for the months of Sept. and Oct. Please send me such a copy each month.

The new procedures you are instituting on Sankirtana Party are very encouraging to me. The opportunities for expanding the Sankirtana Movement are unlimited. We should tax our brains as to what is the best way to present Krishna Consciousness to particular people at a particular time and place. I have always thought that in L.A. there should be at least ten Sankirtana Parties going out simultaneously and as you have indicated, such places as Long Beach and other areas can each have their own Krishna Consciousness center. I am so much grateful to you for being such a strong soldier in pushing on this movement. Please continue in this way and give example to your Godbrothers and sisters. Please offer my blessings to all the L.A. Prabhus.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
