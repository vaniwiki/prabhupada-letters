My dear Mukunda Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5/10/73 as well as the copy of the letter from the Indian Deputy High Commissioner. Regarding my seeing the Pope, now I am India, and then I shall go to Africa, Australia, Hong Kong, and U.S.A. So it is not possible to go there at this time. It can be postponed to a future date. I shall let you know.

I am glad to hear that your Sunday program is successful. One thing is that you should keep everything very clean. That is the first business. Every room should be as clean as a mirror. The prasadam room should be immediately cleaned after taking prasadam, otherwise you are inviting rats. Be careful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
