====== Letter to: Tulsi, Bhakta dasa, Pat, Sandy, Bill, Geoffrey, Terry ======

San Diego

My dear Tulsi das, Bhakta das, Pat, Sandy, Bill, Geoffrey, and Terry Prabhus,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letters dated 1st March, 1971 requesting that I visit San Diego temple upon my return to U.S.A. Thank you for your invitation. When I go to L.A. next time, I will be sure to visit San Diego temple as well. But when that will be I can't say. My program is not yet fixed. Presently arrangements are being made for me to go to Australia, Malaysia and Russia also. So my return to U.S.A. may be somewhat delayed.

I don't know what kind of photos you used, but they are looking especially nice. All of you are such fine looking Vaisnavas. So be blessed and go forward in Krishna Consciousness. You are looking so nice. And your altar is looking very nice also. Thank you very much.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
