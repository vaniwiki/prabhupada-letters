My dear Radhey Syam Kripalu

Sarasvati das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 29-1-75 and have noted the contents. I thank you very much for your very nice painting of Krishna. It is very beautiful. I am glad that you are feeling happy in Krishna Consciousness. Please continue to follow all of the rules and regulations very carefully and strictly so that your spiritual life will flourish. Rise early, chant 16 rounds, attend mangala arati and classes and you life will be perfect.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I do not remember your name very well. Could you tell me where and when you were initiated? If you would tell me this information, I could put it in our files. Thank you.\\
