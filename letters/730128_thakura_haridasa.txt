====== Thakura Haridasa ======

Los Angeles

My dear Thakura Haridasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15th January, 1973, and I have noted the contents carefully. It is very nice to see that you are so enthusiastic for assisting me in pushing on this Krsna Consciousness movement. That is very nice. Now make sure you chant the 16 rounds every day on the beads, attend the classes, and follow all the regulative principles very rigidly. This will make you more and more advanced. In addition everything must be executed with great enthusiasm. You must be very enthusiastic to serve Krsna.

You have asked many questions, but for this question-answering I have created 12 GBC men. The GBC man in your zone is Karandhara. So you may please consult with him, and whatever he decides, that is all right. I am now desiring to utilize my time only for translating these books like __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ so that I can give them to you, my disciples. So if the management is taken over by the GBC, in cooperation with the temple presidents and the other devotees, then I will be free for this purpose, and I shall be very much indebted to you all. So the general policy is that for brahminical initiation the candidate is recommended first by the temple president or GBC man, then it is considered. So please continue your book distributing very enthusiastically. This shall please me very much. And please try and work cooperatively with the other devotees for pushing on this great movement of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Hoping this finds you well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
