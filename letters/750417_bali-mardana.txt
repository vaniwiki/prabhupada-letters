My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 7, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for sending the $1,000 to Bombay. Your article is very nice. You should continue to write very nicely. I am giving your article to the press editors to check over for printing.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
