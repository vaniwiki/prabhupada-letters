Baltimore

My dear Sama and Sammita Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 22, 1972, and I am so glad to hear that you are reopening the Baltimore temple and that you are prepared to stay there your life long for developing it to the highest standard. Yes, I was little disturbed to hear that we had closed down the Baltimore temple before. Baltimore is a very important city of your country and we must maintain our center there at all costs. I can understand by your letter that you are both very serious and sincere devotees of Krsna, husband and wife, so I think that you will have no difficulty in performing your duties there. First business will be to preach widely throughout the city and distribute our books and Krsna Consciousness propaganda. In this way, try to recruit some local men to help you. You are only two persons, therefore big temple with deity worship and so many other things will be impossible to maintain. Therefore if you get a place, simply hold our standard program of kirtana morning and evening, with class, inviting friends and other people that you meet. In this way develop the thing gradually, we are not in very much hurry to get big big house and very comfortable position, no. Our first and foremost business is to spread Krsna Consciousness. So utilize every opportunity that Krsna gives you for preaching His message, that is real meaning of temple management.

Hoping this meets you both in the best of health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
