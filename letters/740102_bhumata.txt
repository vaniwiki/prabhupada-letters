====== Bhumata ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bhumata,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 27, 1973. I can understand that you are sometimes experiencing difficulties but that you are very sincerely trying to become Krsna Conscious and that you have a number of persons there who are interested in your presentation of Krsna Consciousness. Actually this material world is full of suffering conditions and the only way to become free from these sufferings which are due to past sinful activities is to chant Hare Krsna. In this age no other method of rectification is possible. Along with the chanting of Hare Krsna we have to rigidly observe the prohibition of four sinful activities. If only these things we can do our lives can become perfect. I think you have my books so please study them carefully. There is no other scripture which can compare to the Vedic scriptures so we should study these scriptures exclusively. When one becomes an initiated disciple although he has respect for the Christian Bible, nevertheless he must understand the Bhagavad-gita and must apply all study there and not spend time unnecessarily with other literatures. Therefore if you can chant and follow the four regulative principles and read our books only I am sure you will find a relief from all difficulties. Regarding marriage matters and second initiations, these things should be taken up with GBC representative for that zone. More and more I wish to not be involved in management affairs and want to devote me time to translating books so please have some trust in those representatives I have placed as Temple presidents and GBC members. They know the standard procedures in these matters and they can advise you.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
