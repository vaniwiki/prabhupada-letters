====== Sudama ======

Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 1, 1972, and I thank you very much for the news that many cassette-tapes you have sent for continuing the taping process of my lectures and translating. Otherwise they are either unobtainable or very costly here in India, so it is a very nice service. I am also very encouraged to hear that Japanese language translations of some of my books will be brought out soon. That is very important step forward for our preaching work there, because without books and magazines, what authority or what basis have we got for preaching?

By end of March I shall be going to Australia, at least for two weeks, and after that Hong Kong, similarly, for about two weeks and then I shall be coming to Tokyo, so perhaps by early May I may arrive in Tokyo.

You are correct to be very tolerant with Kartikeya, and if you also preach very strongly and with full conviction, and if you are always kind and gentle with him, then he will take the hint and give up his nonsense attraction for Maya and want to make himself perfect as the firm devotee of the Lord.

I have received the letters from Shayatyadanya, and they are under reply. He shall receive it soon. I'm glad to hear that despite so many language difficulties, still Trivikrama Maharaja and the others are increasing sales of BTG. That is good sign.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
