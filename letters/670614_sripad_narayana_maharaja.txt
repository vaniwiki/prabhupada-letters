My dear Narayana Maharaj,

I thank you very much for your letter dated June 7 1967 along with the letter of Sriman Rayrama (Raymond Marais). While replying you this letter I am feeling well. From the hospital I have been transferred to the New Jersey seashore and I am glad to inform you that I am improving daily, a little bit. The weakness is still continuing and sometimes I feel dizziness but the seashore breeze gives me such relief. My disciples here are Godsend, they are all more than my father and mother, and they are taking so much care for me that I shall never be able to repay the debts. I hope to survive by the prayers of the boys otherwise I would have died on the day when the stroke was so severe. All the boys in three branches in New York, San Francisco and Montreal, prayed for me to Sri Krishna and chanted the whole night and with vow they fasted and I am sure only for their prayer I am on the path of recovery. I cannot express my gratitude for their sincere love for me and I can only pray that Sri Krishna may bless them with advanced Krishna consciousness. In the hospital they spent money like anything up to the extent of 600-700 rupees daily, so there is no dearth of care and treatment, but still I think Ayurvedic treatment is better for this kind of disease. After all only Krishna can help me; medicine is not sufficient. I thank you for your letter and consulting Giri Maharaja and other Vaishnavas. Your good wishes and other Vaishnavas good wishes can only save me. Your letter has also given me sufficient strength. I am thinking of returning to India as soon as I get a little strength because by plane it will take at least 24 hours by the fast air line so I must have sufficient strength to fly that long a period and as advised by you I shall go directly to Calcutta and after consulting some good physician there I may come back to Mathura-Vrindaban. But I am sure if I can go back to Vrindaban the atmosphere will cure me. The danger period is over by the grace of Lord Krishna.

So far the Delhi books are concerned, you can arrange immediately for their dispatch to Howrah station by goods train which runs every week and goes very fast. All the books should be listed in duplicate and one of them should be sent with the railway receipt to M/S. United Shipping Corp. 14/2 Old China Bazaar St. No. 18, Calcutta 1. By registered Post with Acknowledgement [Indistinct]. The other copy of the list of books may be sent to me. The packing may be done very nicely and the steel trunks may be used for packing. If they are not sufficient to cover all the books, then wooden boxes should be purchased and packed nicely bound with iron straps. The steel trunks also should be strapped with iron straps.

In each and every packing box the following marks should be given:

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
New York (Via Howrah Station)

For the time being you can purchase some bottles Chavanaprasa and… [Indistinct]…-purchased from Sadhana Ousadhalaya who has got branches in Chandni Chowk, Delhi.

In Fathe-Puri, [Indistinct] No. 32 there is a firm SS, Brijbasi and Sons, please see them and enquire what they have done in respect of our orders for pictures for which we have sent 100 dollars--and let me know the fate of our order. From the amount Rs 2 235/-you will spend all that is required for performing Delhi affairs and the balance may be deposited in my SB account # 1452 with the Bank of Baroda Ltd. Chandni Chowk, Delhi. If I return to India money will be required or if I do not return the same will be paid by check to Dwarkin and sons who have already submitted their invoice for musical instruments.

I hope you will kindly do the needful as per my instructions and let me know by return mail. All the expenditure including your going to Delhi and coming back, postal conveyance, everything, should be done out of my money.

Vinod Kumar may come here after he has duly received the passport and visa. I am replying his letter separately.

Hope this will find you in good health. Am awaiting your kind reply.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Sri Krishna Pandit and Chandra Sekhar & Vinoda Kumara will help you in doing things nicely. Please make the R/R Freight Paid and send me [Unreadable] R/R along with the duplicate list of books.
