====== Letter to: Saucarya ======

My dear daughter, (Soucharya devi dasi)

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 18, 1976 and I have received your two checks. Thank you very much.

Simply chant Hare Krishna and follow the four regulative principles and Lord Krishna will surely give you all protection.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
