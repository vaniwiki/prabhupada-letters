Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that this time while coming from Delhi to Bombay I saw one Mr. M.N. Chandhuri he is a very nice gentleman and important West Bengal Government officer, he is in charge of the department of development and planning, government of West Bengal. His office is at Raj Bhavan, Calcutta. He wanted to help me in any way in the government affairs. So immediately see him with some prasadam and flowers. His office phone number is as follows; 23 29 19, 221681/476, 230177-79. His residential number is as follows; 44 53 22.

I am enclosing herewith an introductory letter which you can take with you when you go to see him. First of all try to invite him to come see our Mayapur establishment, give him nice reception, and then try to take his help in acquiring lands. He has personally promised to help me in every way, because he is impressed with my missionary activities all over the world. You can take help from him also about some of our disciples citizenship for which you have already applied.

I asked you to open a bank account for purchasing land, so did you open it? so why did you not let me know the account number etc.? So do the needful.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
