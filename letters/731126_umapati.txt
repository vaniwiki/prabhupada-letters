====== Umapati ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Umapati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 30, 1973 and I have noted its contents carefully.

As far as your grhastha community committee, I have no objection as it has the approval of Karandhara prabhu and he is there for you all to take advice from. One thing is though that we should not take such meetings and committees too seriously, as in the ultimate capacity our chanting is the only thing that will save us. However, if sometimes devotees should like to come together and chant Hare Krsna and discuss, just as we instituted our Istagosthi program, then this of course I have no objection to.

Please offer my blessings to my beloved disciples there, and please extend my well-wisher to your good wife. I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
