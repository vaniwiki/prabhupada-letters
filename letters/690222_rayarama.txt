====== Rayarama ======

My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 19, 1969 and I am so glad to learn that the New York temple will be able to meet the $750 monthly payments I requested. So far as Dai Nippon's quotation at $2,100 for 20,000 copies with a sixty day period before delivery, please send me the original letter if you have received anything. But I had understood that Brahmananda was negotiating to lessen the amount to $1,500. From your letter I see you did not understand that I meant the typesetting and layout work to be done by Dai Nippon within the quotation. But now I understand that they are going to charge more for this work. If we have to pay them more for the typesetting and layout, then there is no question of stopping our own men from doing this work. So it was clearly misunderstanding.

Now our policy should be as follows: 1. the layout should be done by us, 2. there should be no advertisements, 3. under different headings we shall publish articles from __Bhagavad-gita As It Is, Srimad-Bhagavatam, Brahma Samhita, Nectar of Devotion,__ Vedanta Philosophy, __Upanisads,__ etc. as well as comic pictures when possible. Besides that, if some of our students write as they have assimilated the philosophy, that also should be welcome. You say that Rohini Kumar is an artist, so he can do comic work. There are other girls there such as Indira who can also do this. So we shall fill up the pages simply with Vedic ideas. Now the policy should be straight that this Back to Godhead is completely different from all other magazines. As there are different magazines for different subject matters, this magazine will be simply devoted for Vaisnava philosophy, or Krishna Consciousness movement. That should be our policy. So immediately you can arrange for two months layout. How are you going to select the articles? I would like to know. We should lay out the subject matter as nicely as possible to our intelligence and capacity, and without any ambition that it must attract customers. They may attract or not attract, it doesn't matter. We are selling __Back To Godhead__ through the personal approach, through the Sankirtana Party, so I expect each center to sell 50 copies daily on the average as we have practical experience here. In this way, if four centers sell on an average 200 copies daily, then we come to the point of selling 6,000 copies directly which will cover the expense of printing and other charges. The balance 14,000 copies can be sold by the temples simply on profit. If they are not sold, then we distribute free to different societies, libraries, public institutions, respectable gentlemen, schools, etc. In this way we shall make propaganda. The idea is like that of a Bible society in India which distributes millions of dollars in the shape of biblical literature without any consideration of return. Similarly, we have to sacrifice each $750 on this principle. If there is return, that is alright, but still we have to do it on a missionary spirit. That is my idea. So try to think on this program and do the needful.

I have received the booklet known as __Paramahamsa Sarasvati Goswami__ issued by the Gaudiya Mission of London. I can understand that this brochure was written by my godbrother, Professor Sannyal, but the essay is not very practical. It contains some ideal discussions only, and I know that this Professor Sannyal is personally deviated from all of these ideas. So I don't think it is very much valuable for publishing in __Back To Godhead.__

So I hope the above has answered all of your questions. Please keep me informed how things are progressing, and also about your health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
