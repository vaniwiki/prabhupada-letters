====== Letter to: Hayagriva ======

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 7, 1969, and I have noted the contents. I am so glad to learn that Mr. Ginsberg is taking some serious interest in our Hare Krishna Movement. When he actually comes into Krishna Consciousness, which I expect will be in the very near future, at that time our movement will get a great impetus.

I understand that in New Vrindaban you have got electricity, and I shall be glad to know what is the condition of the atmosphere there. The other day, I saw in the paper that there was very strong snow-storms in New York and the airport service had stopped there completely. Is there any snow-storm in New Vrindaban also? If not, I can go whenever you call me there because here I have no serious business just now. In London, they have not yet been able to find out a suitable temple house, but their propaganda work is going on very nicely. They are attending almost every night somewhere in kirtana engagements, and five or six English boys have joined them already. So I was thinking of opening the London temple on the Birthday of Lord Caitanya which falls on March 4, 1969. I have already written to them about this, but if it doesn't take place, then why not make foundation stone ceremony on that date in New Vrindaban? If the climate is not too much obstructive, then we can hold a ceremony on that day on account of Lord Caitanya's Advent and lay down the foundation stone of our New Vrindaban construction work.

In the meantime, I am enclosing herewith some plans and a letter from Angelo Cummings who is in New York temple. He is also ready to help in the construction work. After examining the plans, you can return them to the boy in New York and open correspondence with him. If Nara Narayana and he conjointly work, then very quickly the construction will be finished. Please inform me what was the report of the press boys. Anyway, press or no press, we must have some houses there because many students are very much eager to go to New Vrindaban.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Syama Dasi. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
