====== Ramesvara Prabhu ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your letter dated December 15th, 1975. I have noted the contents carefully.

Regarding the suggestion for book selling, the point is that the Temples must pay the cost of printing. Then they may sell for whatever price they like.

The transcendental competition is nice. If Jayatirtha Prabhu defeats Tamala Krishna Maharaja, then Tamala will have heart failure. Go on selling books. My Guru Maharaja was very much anxious about selling books and preaching, so you are pleasing him by this bombastic flood of books all over the world. Thank you.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Your letter dated December 27, 1975 has been delivered by Tamala and I have noted the contents. In regard to sending money for the India projects, after covering the costs of printing, whatever balance is left should be sent. The printing cannot stop, it is the first consideration. But if there is more printing then there is more income, so what is the difficulty? One thing however, is that we have just engaged the best and most experienced construction company in India, Larson and Turbrow, to complete our Bombay project. We have had to guarantee them seven lacs Rupees per month for the next nine months. And thereafter we shall immediately begin the Mayapur temple. So I think $50,000 will not be sufficient. Gopala Krishna Prabhu suggests that in addition to sending this amount, if the Radha Damodara Party is given books at the printer's cost, then whatever else they collect they can send directly to me in India. In this way we shall be able to meet the Rs. 7 lacs per month. So please make this arrangement to send $50,000 per month as well as supplying Radha Damodara Party at cost. Begin this immediately.

The new Sixth Canto Bhagavatams are very nice. Yes, actually they are worshipable Deities. Be careful that our books do not appear like Bible printing. Sometimes the Christians also put gold guilding on their books, but people are adverse to purchasing Bibles. Neither our books should be given free, there must be some renumeration, otherwise it will be like Bible selling.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
