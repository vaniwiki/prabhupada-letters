====== Ramesvara ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 5th. and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very much pleased to hear of your increased book distribution and it gives me great pleasure to hear of your increased eagerness to distribute my literature. Through the distribution of this literature, we can completely annihilate all the bogus yogi groups in the world. Of this fact I am sure. Therefore there is no need for us to directly attack these charlatans but simply by this distribution of books the sunlight of Krishna consciousness will prevail. It has been brought to my attention that some of my students are not studying. I do not know if this applies to you or the devotees under your care, but I must stress again that we must have our classes one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening and the devotees must also chant regularly their sixteen rounds and follow the principles. The rest of the time they may go on distribution of my books. So I hope you will do the needful in this regard. Still again I must express my appreciation for Sriman Tripurari Prabhu's outstanding service, as well as all the devotees in your party. So my request to you is to go on in this way with more enthusiasm. This is the key. Always remain enthusiastic and inspire others and your life will be glorious and at the end you are sure to go back to Home, back to Godhead. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
