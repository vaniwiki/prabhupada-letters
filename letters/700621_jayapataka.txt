====== Jayapataka ======

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I sent you one letter dated 14th June, 1970, the copy of which is enclosed herewith. So I do not know if you have received this letter.

I am very anxious to hear from you how you are proceeding towards India. Whether you have obtained a visa, etc. Please inform me by return mail of your present position and plans.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
