My dear Woompati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 14th and 21st April, 1970, respectively, and I am very glad to receive good news that your Krishna work is going on nicely.

You have selected your bride, Ilavati, who I think is a French girl, so I think this marriage will be nice. But our all selection should be with a view to serve Krishna, that we must not forget in any circumstance!

The other point is that all my best students are now in Europe. Yourself, Tamala, Mukunda, Hansadutta, Syamasundara---all of you are in now double strength, so please do things very enthusiastically and organize the world Sankirtana Party because in India the people are already expecting us next year. Also open as many branches as possible.

So it is very good that now all the devotees can take Prasadam together. All the devotees must keep together, that will be an extra strength.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
