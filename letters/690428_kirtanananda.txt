====== Letter to: Kirtanananda ======

95 Glenville Avenue\\
Allston, Mass. 02134

My Dear Kirtanananda, 

Please accept my blessings. I am very happy to receive your letter dated 23 April, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I understand that due to rain New Vrindaban is not very dry now, but I hope it will be nice by the 18th of May when I wish to go there. Herewith you will find my program in this part of the country, and please do the needful. I have not as yet heard anything about if there were any tangible negotiations about the adjacent land with buildings. I have not heard anything from either Hayagriva or you. I hope it is going on, and it will be completed on my arrival there.

Please convey my blessings to the others there with you. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
