====== Letter to: Pusta Krsna ======

Johannesburg, South Africa

My dear Pusta Krishna Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 11, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am prepared to come to South Africa by the middle of July. I can come there from Brazil. We shall need at least one visa for Wayne Gunderson (Upendra) and if possible, one for Robert Campagnola (Harikesa). Please arrange for that.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. One travel agent in New Delhi has told us that two of her clients (American) were going to Johannesburg with visa, sufficient funds onward ticket, passport, etc., and due to some change all of the sudden in the Government, they were thrown into jail, and the next day, they were sent, at their own expense out of the country. The travel agent said that it could be even more severe for an Indian citizen, so, if there is any risk, it is not a very good idea. So, you should find out if there any risk at all and then let me know at my Los Angeles address. ACBS\\
