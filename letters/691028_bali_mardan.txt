====== Bali Mardan ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 15,1969, and it is very, very encouraging that you propose to go to Australia. Formerly I wanted to send Chidananda Brahmachari to Australia, and he attempted to take permission to go there. Somehow or other it was not fruitful. If you can now go there and start a center, it will be certainly all Glories to Sri Guru and Gouranga! So take information further in this connection, and as you say that you are in correspondence with some friends there, this is all right. In the meantime make the Kyoto center strong enough to stand up, and then you can immediately attempt this great adventure. Krishna will help you. I think when winter season will prevail very much on the Northern side of the world , the Southern side of the world will compensate the declining tendency of the __BTG__ sales. There is New Zealand, Fiji Islands, etc. So by the order of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu we shall not leave any place within this world at least without Krishna Consciousness. Gradually we are increasing the number of our books. In the meantime both yourself and Sudama may take quotation either from Dai Nippon or any other reliable printing company for a book of the style of __TLC__. There will be 10,000 copies, and 400 pages, including 50 pages of color pictures.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
