====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

Buffalo

My dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 12, 1970 and noted the content very carefully.

I think you will remember that I called you not Gargamuni but Gargamoney. So whenever I required some money I approached you and you were kind to pay me immediately. So please continue your capacity in this way to supply money to the Society. That will please Krsna. I am immediately in need of $250,000 somehow or other. Collect this money and both of you come here. We shall open a very gorgeous branch in Calcutta. Calcutta is my birth-place, so all of you as my disciples do something unique in Calcutta. That will be fitting service to your Spiritual Master.

I hope this will meet you in good health, and come here with the money as soon as possible.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
