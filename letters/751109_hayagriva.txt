My dear Hayagriva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 23, 1975 with the proposed Table of Contents for the philosophy book. By the grace of Krsna you have got a special capacity to do this work. I am very glad that you have revived your activities in the editorial work. So Krsna will certainly help. Do not neglect chanting 16 rounds at least. Yes, you can come and see me wherever I am, either at Mayapur in the spring of next year or it may be that I may go to Imphal in Manipur after the Vrndavana festival. The Table of Contents are nice and you can come and we shall discuss further. Yes, you have got a nice farm in New Vrndavana. If you are not there, then let others stay. That is all right.

Regarding the scientists, they will always find something new because their knowledge is not yet standardized. They will go on making new discoveries, on account of their imperfect knowledge. The modern scientists despite their experience of imperfectness, they take everything that they find out as the last word of perfection. Again they find out something which they find out as a further improvement and so they have to adjust everything new. They do not know that the senses are imperfect so any advancement of knowledge with imperfect senses must always remain imperfect.

Our process is different. We admit that we are in the conditional stage and our source of knowledge is not the senses because they are imperfect. We cannot find the right knowledge from the imperfect senses. We therefore take knowledge from the most perfect personality, Krsna, and His faithful servants and the result is that despite all of our imperfect senses, we have perfect knowledge. You have to keep this point of view in your front and pray to Krsna for enlightenment and then we shall be able to understand what is written in the Vedic literature. This is confirmed in the Vedic literatures:__ yasya deve para bhaktir, yasya deva yatha guru__ [ŚU 6.23].

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
