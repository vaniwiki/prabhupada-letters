My dear Nripen Babu,

Please accept my greetings. I hope you have duly received my previous postcards. The Calcutta situation having come down to normal conditions, I have now purchased my Ticket for Japan (Tokyo) on my way to San Francisco and New York (U.S.A). My disciples Sriman Achyutananda Brahmachary and Sriman Ramanuja Brahmachary both will start for Delhi via Kanpur after sending me off for Tokyo. They are starting on 15th night at 9/45 P.M by 39 Up Janata Express reaching Kanpur on the 16th night at 10 P.M. As they are new men, kindly receive them at the station. They can give lectures in Vaishnava cult and if possible you can arrange for their kirtan and lectures; otherwise they may go to Mathura after taking rest for a day or so. I hope this will find you in good health and I shall be glad to hear from you to my San Francisco address as follows: C/o ISKCON 518 Frederick Street San Francisco, California 94117, U.S.A.

Thanking you once more,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
