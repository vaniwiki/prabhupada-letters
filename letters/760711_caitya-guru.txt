My dear Caitya Guru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 5, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Very good. Every thing that you have stated sounds very nice. You are experienced man so do it very conscientiously. Your sign reads "The Perfection of Yoga," actually that is a fact. Bhaktiyoga is the best. Yoginam api sarvesam, madgatenantaratmana . . . [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]]. This Hari-kirtana is the best yoga bhakti-yoga. You just follow our regulative principles and teach others and you will be successful, without any doubt. You are trained up, and you speak the language of the local people, so do everything conscientiously and my blessings are always with you. However, don't create any awkward situation that may be criticized. Caesar's wife must be above criticism. Up to now as I have got respectable situation, I wish that all my disciples will have similar respectable position in society. That will keep my name good. Like father, like son.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
