====== Dr. Aggarwal ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Dr. Aggarwal,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Feb. 25, and I have examined the contents carefully. Thanks very much for the poem.

I am very pleased to hear that you are regularly visiting our Washington Temple, and seeing our Damodara Prabhu and the others.

Actually one can be perfectly Krishna-Conscious without being literate. Education is not necessary. Simply it is required to accept the fact, that we are the eternal servants of Krishna, and engage in some tangible service. Otherwise, there are so many convincing arguments, i.e. the __Bhagavad-Gita,__ to bring us to the right point of surrender. Even the __Karma-Kanda,__ and __Jnana-Kanda,__ sections of the Vedas are designed to bring to the proper __Sidhanta,__ conclusion. And that conclusion is made by Krishna in the __Gita,__ that one who knows the purpose behind the Vedas, surrenders unto Him.

Four things can be surrendered:---Our life, our words, our intelligence, and our money. So just try to gradually engage these things in Krishna's Service. One thing you can enquire from Damodara, is about our Life-Membership-Program. Here in India we have now over 2000 members, including may prominent men.

You are a learned gentleman, a medical doctor, so kindly apply your determination, to understand this Krishna-Conscious movement, and I am confident that Krishna will bless you more and more. Kindly just read our books, and help us as you are able.

I am going to Mayapur by the 15th, for the celebration of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's Appearance Day, and the opening of our new centre there.

Meanwhile I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
