====== Vaikunthanatha, Saradia ======

Trinidad

My dear Vaikunthanatha and Saradia, my beloved son and daughter,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated 4th July, 1971 from Trinidad and it has encouraged me so much that I am now confident that my missionary activities will go on even in my absence. You young husband and wife are so nice that Krishna will shower His blessings upon you both incessantly. Please keep up the spirit of preaching work and you will be victorious wherever you go.

I have received your press cuttings and they are very much encouraging. So you concentrate you energy for preaching in that part of the world. You are already popular there and you will become more and more popular.

Nara Narayana may be required for constructing a temple in Mayapur in India, but if he doesn't go to India then surely he will go to Trinidad to construct a new temple there.

So the public is in sympathy with our movement and I am sure that there will be no difficulty in extending your visas further. Work sincerely, keeping faith on Krishna and the Spiritual Master and everything will come out successful.

Thanking you once more for your noble activities. Hope this will find you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
