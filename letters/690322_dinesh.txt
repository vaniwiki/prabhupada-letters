====== Dinesh ======

My dear Dinesh,

Please accept my blessings. I am sorry that I could not acknowledge receipt of your albums which I duly received, although I could not play them for want of machine. But I have received Mukunda's opinion about it. He says that it is super excellent to say the least. They are going to have it played by the BBC in London. Similarly, Govinda dasi is going to play it here in such important station. We are going there this morning for about an hour of music and discussion on the station here. So I hope you will be successful in your adventure.

Regarding Syama's kirtana; it is also nice. But it does not behoove that I shall sing with her. Let us see how much she is advanced in Krishna Consciousness. And then we shall think of full cooperation.

Hope you are well, and convey my blessings to Krishna devi and your daughter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have also received on letter from Krishna devi and your picture of Birbhadra. It is very nicely posed. %%__%% great-grandchild of Srimad %%___%% Das Balaji. Thanks.

When Purusottama will go to S.F., you will send me the tape-recorder with him.
