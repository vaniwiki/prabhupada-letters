====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of you letter of January 26, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I am very pleased to understand that you are going to contribute $250.00 for murtis. I think that you can pay at the rate of $100.00 twice and $50.00 once. That will save much time, but if it is inconvenient, you can pay at the rate of $50.00 per month. As soon as I get $100.00 I shall immediately order the deities with this advance.

I am so glad to learn that you are chanting very regularly and trying to follow the four principels of restriction as far as possible. I have got an account with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Montreal, and, if you like, you may deposit the money there in my account. I can send you the name of the branch and my account number if you like. I think this will save time in your remitting your contribution.

Thanking you for your letter and for your sincere good will toward our mission of Krishna Consciousness. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
