====== Mr. Rameshchandra Lalidji ======

<card class="letter">
Dear Mr. Rameshchandra Lalidji:

Please accept my blessings. I have received a report of the progress of Hyderabad. I am pleased to note that the construction has already started and the columns have come up to beam level. I appreciate very much your interest in propagating the teaching of the Bhagavad-gita, and it is because of the assistance of men like you that we are constructing a temple in Hyderabad.

I am pleased that the work is proceeding now at good speed and request that you assist in completing the temple by next Janmastami, and I will come to inaugurate the opening ceremony.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
