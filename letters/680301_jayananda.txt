====== Jayananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated Feb. 23, 1968. The description of the house which you propose to purchase is very much attractive. And I think it is Krishna's arrangement by His inconceivable energy in exchange of your sincere service to the Lord. I have gone through the whole letter and it is all encouraging, and therefore I have full sympathy with the transaction, and I approve of your good attempts to purchase this house according to the right estimation; it appears to me all round good. The arrangement of payment is also very nice. I know that you haven't got to pay the house tax, as it is owned by ISKCON, which is tax free organization all round.

As you have desired to liquidate the loan in respect of this purchase, I am sure Krishna will help you in this direction.

We are starting for S.F. on the 8th, flight no. 977 at 10:10 a.m.; this information is already sent to Uddhava. I think you will do the needful. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
