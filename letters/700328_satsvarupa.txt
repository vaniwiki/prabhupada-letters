My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26th March, 1970, along with transcription of tape #23.

Regarding opening of a branch in Providence, Rhode Island, it is very encouraging. Both Nandakisora and Sri Dhama are nice devotees and I am sure they will be successful in conducting the new center. It is a good news for me. To open a center for us is not very difficult job. Simply the devotees who volunteer their service must be very serious and sincere.

Both Sri Dhama and Nandakisora are good administrators of Prasadam which is our peak medicine for driving away Maya; so I have all blessings for them. Let them chant Hare Krsna and distribute Prasadam, and things will come very quickly.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
