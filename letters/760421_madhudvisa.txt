====== Madhudvisa ======

New York

My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of April 11, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. I have sent you and I have experience that you have done nicely in Melbourne, and so you are the right one to organize the New York centre.

I am here in your temple, I'm feeling your separation. But, I'm seeing everything is going nicely, the same as when it was under your management. The devotees here, they are jumping and dancing very nicely. You can also establish the kirtana hall on the farm and install Gaura Nitai Deities. Gaura Nitai can be established anywhere, and it is simple to worship Them simply chant before Their Lordships. He doesn't mind that you have not decorated very nicely, but if you chant and dance He is very pleased. So you have my permission to take loan for this purpose, as you have mentioned for $25,000.

Rathayatra, that will be your achievement. Nobody has done it before. Rathayatra in New York should have been introduced long ago but there was no competent men to do it. So Krishna has sent you there and most likely I shall attend the New York Rathayatra. New York is the place where I first landed and now we have our own place and books, so if you do it very nicely it will be a great triumph.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
