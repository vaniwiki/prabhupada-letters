====== Letter to: Sri Debasis Bagahi ======

Sri Debasis Bagahi\\
New Delhi

Dear Sri Bagchi ji,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th December, 1976, which has only now just caught up with me as I was travelling.

Please go on with your translation work. When I see the translation, then we shall consider the honorarium. I am presently in Mayapur and will be remaining here until mid-March. I will be going to Vrindaban at that time.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
