====== Mahabuddhi, Library Party ======

My dear Mahabuddhi and Library Party,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 8, 1976, and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. Continue with this program of standing orders. It is very important preaching work. At least if they read our books they will not speak nonsense that kirtana is nuisance. I have asked Gopala Krsna and Tejyas das to keep sufficient stock of all of our books so that we can supply the standing orders immediately. They very much appreciate the fine printing and color illustrations which are not available in other Indian publications. So somehow or other introduce these books into the universities and libraries like that.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. what books do you give with a standing order? Please list them.\\
