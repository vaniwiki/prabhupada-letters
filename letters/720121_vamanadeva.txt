====== Vamanadeva ======

Dallas

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 1-3-72, and I am pleased to note that you are happy to be engaged in working on the new ISKCON school in Dallas as maintenance man and carpenter, I have no objection if GBC men have approved your closing of Oklahoma City center and moving to Dallas. Actually, I have appointed them to act on my behalf, so it is their responsibility now to sanction such matters and make decisions of management.

I hope this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
