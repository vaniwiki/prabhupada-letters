====== Letter to: Tirthapada ======

Sydney

My dear Tirthapada,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter undated and to know that you have gone to Sydney to execute Krsna consciousness there.

Now you three combined together are strong trio, so just push on Krsna consciousness movement in Australia. You have seen in London all kinds of fluctuation in establishing our temple there. You have got sufficient experience in this connection. Now you can utilize your talent and experience in establishing a very nice temple in Sydney.

Upendra has requested me to go there by January next year, so if you can make all arrangement complete by that time, certainly I shall go and install the Deity as I did in London.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
