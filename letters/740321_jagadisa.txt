Dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted those devotees who you have recommended for first initiation, and their spiritual names are as follows.

Keith Haslar---Kamsahanta dasa

Lorraine Haslar---Lokadrsti devi dasi

Drew---Duryodhana guru dasa

Be sure to carefully train them in offenseless chanting, by avoidance of the ten offenses to chanting. You may chant on their beads and hold a fire yajna. Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am also enclosing sacred thread and gayatri initiation for the following second initiate recommendations. Girijadhava das Brahmacari, Kasi ram das Brahmacari, Taraknath das Brahmacari, and Sukra das Brahmacari. Have them hear the tape of the mantra in the right ear. I think you are aware that this second initiation should be taken very gravely and not childishly, so please impress upon them their new obligations.

At this time I am also sending you two accepted initiates from the Regina, Canada center as follows:\\
Norman Allard---Nandikesvara dasa,\\
Linda Allard---Mandari devi dasi.
