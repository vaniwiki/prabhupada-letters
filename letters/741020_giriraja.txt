Bombay

My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen the BBT Memo to all centers dated October 16, 1974 together with the inventory of book stock prepared by Bhugarbha das. Now henceforward you make the following arrangement for getting payment from the temples for BBT. For all book orders the BBT will present the invoice and shipping documents to your bank a/c BBT for collection. The orders may be shipped by rail, so the temples will pay the invoice amount in order to receive the shipping documents from the Bank, and then collect the goods. Now that the inventory has been sent to all centers, there should be no complaint that there are no books being made available. Let them pay for what they order, and you fill the orders promptly, so there should be no difficulty.

Now I am sending Nayana Bhirama and his wife to Bombay for distributing books. They are enthusiastic for clearing up the book stock there. Give them all facilities for selling the books, as well as their maintenance and travel, and let us see how they can do.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
