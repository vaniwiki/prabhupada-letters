My dear Gurukrpa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 9, 1975 and have noted the contents carefully. I can understand that you are feeling something regarding your collecting program. These things can be decided by the GBC. One thing is that I may take up one project of constructing a Varna Ashrama College and Temple in Kuruksetra in India. I am presently negotiating for this, and if we get the opportunity, I shall spend the money here first. So in Japan you go on collecting, and I shall tell you how to spend.

Anyway you don't feel any botheration. Dai Nippon has agreed to take money in exchange of books. Whatever money you pay, you print books and send to India. You can also send to Australia or to USA if they want. You begin with Srimad-Bhagavatam and the small edition of Bhagavad-gita. Our work must go on. The world is suffering on account of not taking up Krishna consciousness, so we have to try to save them. You kindly help me to do this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
