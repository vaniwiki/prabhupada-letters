====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

Montreal

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your check of $100 for my book fund account and thank you very much for it.

I have received information from the Scindia Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. that the pair of Deities, 24 inches high, weighing about 50 kilograms the pair, will be arriving in Montreal sometimes by the end of May 1970. They will be delivered by the Montreal Agents of the company. The Deities will be carried by the vessel "Jaladhan." So you may note this, and you have to prepare a bigger throne for accommodating the larger Deities.

When the large Deities are installed, the small Deities should be worshiped as __Vijaya Vigraha__ which means this pair of Deities may go outside the Temple in a small car as they have made in L.A. This car was made by Nara Narayana, so he can give you the idea. This __Vijaya Vigraha__ may be taken out with Sankirtana Party, not always, but conveniently. In due course of time, I shall let you know the details.

Your Temple will save about $400, including the price and freight of the Deities from Vrindaban, India. This money may be contributed to my book fund.

I have just heard from Gargamuni that you would like to print future issues of French language BTG in a small size about the size of our "Two Essays." So if you think that this will help increase the sales, then do it with my approval.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
