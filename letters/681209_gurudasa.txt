====== Gurudasa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter of December 4, 1968 and I have noted the contents carefully. I have seen how you have planned the board meeting to be held and it is all very nice. I understand that the MacMillan Company is distributing our book, Bhagavad-gita As It Is, in London also, so if you can also retail this book to friends at the meeting it may prove very helpful in deepening their interest in this science of Krishna Consciousness. If we can present the people with our literature and with the process of kirtana then certainly many will be attracted and will come join us in our activities.

So please convey my blessings to Syamasundara and Malati to whom I am not enclosing a letter herein, and I hope that you are all very well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please let me know when you want the open letter or if possible you can send me the form of the letter which I shall edit & send you the fair copy.

The photos that you have sent are duly received. Just yesterday I have received another letter from Pitamber Dindayal of Guyana.
