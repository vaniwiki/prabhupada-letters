====== Karandhara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your special delivery letter dated May 9, 1972, and I have noted the contents. You may borrow the $15,000 from me, I have no objection. But now you have agreed to give Hayagriva $4000 per month, that was a great mistake. Now you have to rectify it. Now Hayagriva writes me that he is coming to Los Angeles, so we can discuss. Abruptly if we stop, that will not be good. So we have to rectify by arrangement and agreement. I am simply surprised how you all GBC men agreed to give him $4000 per month. So the mistake has been made, now it has to be corrected by other ways.

We shall arrive in LA on the 18th, as per your arrangement.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
