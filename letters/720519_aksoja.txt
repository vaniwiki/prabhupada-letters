<card class="letter">
My dear Aksoja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13 May 1972 and I have noted the contents. I have very much appreciated the enclosed photos of the Amsterdam activities. I am surely thinking to come to London for this year Rathayatra festival and if you like perhaps I can come to Amsterdam also if there is sufficient engagement there. At that time we can see about installing Lord Jagannatha in your temple. I was one time before in Amsterdam and I like that country very much. There are very many cows in that country and this especially is pleasing to me so if you can arrange some big engagement there then I shall gladly come.

I have met also your elder sister in Auckland, New Zealand and your mother also was there and they are both very nice and improving in their Krsna consciousness thanks to you.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
