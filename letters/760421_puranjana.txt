Dear Puranjana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8 April, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. Concerning the alternatives, it sounds like the printing cost of $1.25 is best as this will keep the price down and will also allow the full purport to be there. The general practice in deciding such matters shall be to have the BBT trustees discuss amongst themselves, and then they can submit their plan to me for final sanction.

I have noticed how you are producing so many of our books now in the Spanish and Portuguese language. This is very good. I shall be in Fiji by the 28th April, and shortly thereafter in Hawaii.

I hope that this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
