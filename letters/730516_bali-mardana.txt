====== Letter to: Bali-mardana ======

New York

My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 14, 1973 and have noted the contents.

So now my plans have changed. Karandhara has made arrangements for my physician to come here, thus saving much expense and time. So now I shall remain here in Los Angeles up to the 30th of May, then to New Vrindaban for a few days and then on to London. As soon as you have finished the synonym work on the third canto you can immediately join me wherever I am and we can finish it up in good time.

Regarding fourth canto, go on and prepare for publishing as quickly as possible. The first six volumes are selling very well so we may print more volumes and they will also sell.

If we can also keep up good pace with Caitanya-caritamrita then we may be able to print one 400 page book per month.

Thank you very much for your sincere effort in helping me carry out the directions of my Guru Maharaja.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
