====== Ranadhir ======

My Dear Ranadhir, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated November 23, 1969. I am so pleased to learn of the increased development of New Vrindaban. Please now try to organize a children's school. This is one of our programs in New Vrindaban, and there is Hayagriva, Kirtanananda, Satyabhama, Shama Dasi, Paramananda and yourself. You can form a school committee and get it recognized by the Education Board. Then more children will be sent. There is one small child in Berkeley, and if you so desire, you can ask Hansadutta to send the child in your care.

Your mother has very kindly spoken about me, and she is herself a good lady. Otherwise, how could she have a nice child like you? So please keep in touch with your good mother and try to bring in Krishna Consciousness gradually. That is also one of your duties. As your mother's duty was to raise you till you got strength, similarly when a child is grown up, it is his duty to see to the spiritual welfare of his mother. In the Srimad Bhagavatam the example is Devahuti and Lord Kapiladev. Lord Kapiladev appeared as the Son of Devahuti, and in the absence of Kardamuni, the father of Lord Kapiladev, the Divine Son instructed His mother, Devahuti, and she got elevated to the transcendental position.

Any boy who comes there, please take special care of them. As it generally said, the child is the father of the man. So if we can train little boys to Krishna Consciousness, it will be a great help to our future activities. I was fortunate to get birth in such family, and my father trained me in this line. I am reaping the fruit in this old age for that training. So let New Vrindaban be an ideal spot for Krishna Consciousness population; self-dependent on the local production and cow's milk. That is my ideal.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
