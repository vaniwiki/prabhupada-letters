Dear Mark Anson,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter undated and have heard the contents.

Your attraction to Krsna Consciousness is a very rare achievement for a human being, and you are right to think yourself fortunate to associate with the devotees, and to follow the instructions of a bonafide spiritual master who is following the parampara coming down from Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He has spoken in the Bhagavad-gita.

But I must say that regarding your vision of Lord Vishnu and your flying in the sky - do not be too much dreaming. It may or may not have happened. If you want to advance in a practical, tangible way, practice the rules and regulations, thoroughly read my books, assimilate, chant Hare Krishna mantra, and take the proper directions. I have no objection to your stay with Tusta Krishna Maharaja, but wherever you are follow these principles.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
