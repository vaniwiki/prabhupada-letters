====== Uddhava ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter along with the blueprint of the Almanac for Caitanya Era 484.

I have looked over this work very carefully and it is very intelligently done. This contains all relevant informations concerning our bona fide movement, so I think it will be of utmost use in the matter of approaching foundations and influential parties to understand and support this movement. Therefore, you should print up a large number of copies because we will distribute this booklet very widely for propaganda purposes.

I am so happy that our ISKCON press is now producing such several literatures consecutively like Srimad-Bhagavatam chapter by chapter. So now I am enlivened to write more and more. Thank you very much.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
