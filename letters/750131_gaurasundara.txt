<card class="letter">
Laupahoe hoe, Hawaii

My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I shall be very happy if you would kindly come and see me here. I am scheduled to leave Hawaii on the morning of Feb. 9th, so if you could possibly come before that time it would be very nice.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
