My dear Brother Gabu,

Please accept my blessings. I hope in the meantime you have received the reply of your letter dated 27th March, 1968. Since I wrote you last I have come to New York. Regarding Business: if you send goods on our order then just on presentation of the shipping documents and your bill, my banker, the Bank of America, will pay for it at once. The copy of the bank's letter is enclosed herewith; please find it. If you agree to do business in that way, you can send immediately 20 first class kholes, and immediately ship 10 kholes to New York, and 10 to San Francisco. There is a shipping line, American Mail Service, or there are many shipping lines regularly coming from Calcutta to San Francisco and New York, and you can take advantage of them. We have got some money, about 3000/ Rs., lying with United Shipping Corporation, at 14/2, Old China Bazar Street, Room No. 18, Calcutta. I have sent them several letters for statement of account and they are silent since a long time. I am also enclosing herewith the copy of their letter as enclosed herein.

So if you send the khole, then this shipping corporation will ship the kholes, freight paid, because our money is lying with them. Please see them why they have not replied my letters, submitting statement of account. I am very much ashamed for their behavior because here the people are surprised that they are not submitting the statement of accounts of the money lying with them. And please let me know if you can help us in this matter.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
