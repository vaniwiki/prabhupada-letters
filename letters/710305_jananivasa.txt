====== Jananivasa ======

Columbus, Ohio

My dear Jananivasa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your kind letter dated 13rd January, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear how everything has been improving there in our Columbus center, and how preaching is going on so nicely. Simply if you work with enthusiasm and patience and depend on Krishna, then He will give you all facility to make our Columbus center a grand success.

Our book distribution program is most important work. Anyone reading our KRSNA book, TLC, NOD, and Bhagavad As It Is, is sure to become a Krishna Conscious person. Therefore somehow or other we must push on this literature distribution program, either through schools, colleges, libraries, life membership program or ordinary sales. You are approaching so many groups, etc. inviting them to our feasts. Also you should try to arrange outside engagements with these groups. This will facilitate good opportunity for introducing our literatures especially through the life membership program. That has been our endeavor here in India and it has been most successful. Likewise, you can do the same there. So make your program in that way and let me know how you are doing and what progress you have made.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
