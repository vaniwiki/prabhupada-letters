====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of the painting you have sent. This is not a good style of painting. It is an artistic style for sense gratification only. I cannot encourage this style---it should be stopped immediately. Paintings should be like the Deities, formal and worshipful. This type of painting is sentimental and not authorized. Paintings should be as our artists in New York are doing. Do not introduce any new styles.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: The picture is good from artistic point but we want to worship the Lord.
