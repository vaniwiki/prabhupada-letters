====== Gargamuni ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 6, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I have advised Uddhava to inform you of what is decided regarding your business, and you may invite Kartikeya to come there to help you, as I have advised Uddhava to inform you. But your business must cooperate with the other departments, so that all departments can go on smoothly. Otherwise it is not a very good situation.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am going tomorrow to Columbus.
