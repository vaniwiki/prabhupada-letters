Re: Extension of the validity of my Alien Registration Receipt, Card No. A-17978480.

Dear Sir,

I left the United States of America in July of 1976. As I am planning to go to the United States shortly, and as over one year has passed since I was last there, I am requesting your good office to extend the validity of my Registration Card for another year.

Thanking you.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
