My dear Arjuna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 16, 1973, along with guru daksine. Thank you very much.

So far as your engagement is concerned, I am most satisfied to see that my books are being distributed profusely. Please always follow the four regulative principles and chant minimum sixteen rounds per day. Study my books very carefully and prepare yourself fully for going back to home, back to Godhead.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
