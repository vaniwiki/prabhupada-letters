My dear Jayadharma das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26 July 1976 with enclosed daksine of Rs. 2000/-and have noted the contents. I am pleased to accept on your recommendation the following as my disciples;

Mark Phillips---Mahotsaha dasa

Jane Phillips---Jagat-priya dasi

Greg Jay---Gaura Kesava dasa

You may hold a fire yajna and at that time the names of the initiates as well as their beads chanted on by Gurukrpa Maharaja may be given. Make sure that they are well aware of the four rules and regulations and that they are fixed in chanting the prescribed number of 16 rounds daily on the beads. Without these two principles no one can make advancement on the path of regulated bhakti. Teach them the science of the Bhagavad gita and train them to be first class representatives of Krsna. It is not very difficult, simply one has to hear from the perfect authority who is in disciplic succession from Krsna Himself, and then repeat the same message without any change. If one does this then he is qualified to become guru.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
