====== Nara-narayana ======

Boston

My dear Nara Narayana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter addressed to Gargamuni dated "nil," along with a new set of beads. I have conveyed the letter to Gargamuni after learning from it that you have lost your original set of japa beads and request me to chant on these.

So I have duly chanted them as you have desired, and they are returned herewith enclosed. However, in future, please be very careful to keep these sanctified beads. You should be more heedful. Now be sure to chant at least the prescribed sixteen rounds daily without fail, avoiding the ten offenses to the Holy Name, and thus advance in spiritual strength.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
