====== Letter to: Anandavardhana (Axel Anderson), Jogindra Vandana (John Berg) ======

New Orleans

My dear sons,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Nityananda, I have gladly consented to accept both of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

__Axel Anderson,__

Anandavardhana das (one who is always increasing in ecstasy)

__John Berg,__

Jogindra Vandana das (one who is worshiped by the great yogis)

I am so glad to learn that both of you have been such a great help to Nityananda there in our new Orleans center. I can understand that both of you are very sincere boys, and are very eligible candidates for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street sankirtana and book distribution, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end you will reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
