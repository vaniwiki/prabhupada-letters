====== Letter to: Uthal ======

West Germany

Dear Uthal dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 31st and have noted the contents. I do not think this ship will be successful. Getting and managing a farm is a good proposal. I am encouraging farm projects everywhere. That is a very important, solid program. So do this enthusiastically and Krsna will be pleased.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
