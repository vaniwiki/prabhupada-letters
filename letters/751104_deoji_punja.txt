My dear Deoji Punja:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 14, 1975 with enclosed altered plans for the temple. You are doing solid work, even alone, and I am very pleased. This is the test for a sincere devotee. Simply by depending on the mercy of the Lord and carrying out the order of the spiritual master, ones success in spiritual life is guaranteed. I thank you for your endeavor.

So far the plan is concerned, I shall consult with some of my experienced disciples in this matter and shall let you know. One thing is that the domes should be like the ones we have constructed on our Krishna Balarama Mandir in Vrindaban.

Yes, try to get the preaching permit, so that men can come and help you. Upendra das is in Vrindaban, and he is wanting to come and assist you.

It is good that you are taking the leading part in the raising of the funds. By your sincerity and determination, I do not think you will have any difficulty.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
