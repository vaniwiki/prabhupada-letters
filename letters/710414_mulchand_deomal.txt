My dear Sri Mulchand Deomal,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 1st April, 1971, addressed to Madhudvisa Swami, and I have noted the contents. I have been in extensive touring and then I came back to Bombay on the 16th March, 1971 and then on 24th March we held a very successful Hare Krishna Festival at Cross Maidan here in Bombay, and it lasted for eleven days. I was expecting you to join Sri Jariwalaji who was so kind to come here for a few days during the festival. So far as the Rs 5000- was concerned, it was transferred by mail to my account. It was received and credited in my bank account. I thank you very much.

The back issues of Back to Godhead magazine are not available here but I shall try to get them from USA and shall send you them in due course.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. You will be glad to know that I have been invited by some Russian University to deliver lecture. Most probably I shall be going there very soon. ACB\\
