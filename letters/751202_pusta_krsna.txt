====== Pusta Krsna ======

My dear Pusta Krishna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 17, 1975. Regarding the car, you just register it in your name in Germany. Hansadutta Prabhu has agreed to give the 11% tax until export. Then drive it here and when it is here we will see how to manage.

The list of devotees to be initiated have been named as follows;

Mike Harris---Pandavagrya Das\\
John Antonopaula---Nagendra Das\\
Gail Netherlands---Vimoha Devi Dasi\\
Martha Kriek---Venurati Devi Dasi

You may chant on their beads, and instruct them nicely in the regulative principles and philosophy of Krishna consciousness.

The Jehova's witnesses do not accept the fact of rebirth, and they claim "AWAKE" so this is nonsense. Your letter was very nice. The whole world is in darkness, we are bringing light by preaching Bhagavata Dharma. Thank you for helping me.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I just received you letter dated Nov. 20. Yes a roof carrier will be nice.\\
