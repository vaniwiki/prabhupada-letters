<card class="letter">
My dear Janardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am glad to learn that your good wife is now days taking interest in Krishna Consciousness. Please offer her my blessings. I think a good and sincere husband's influence is working in her. Be happy in family life and both of you become blessed by Krishna consciousness. What about my books.

Yours ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
