====== Syamasundara ======

Bombay

My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your tow letters dated 8th February, 1971 and nil, respectively.

From the beginning it was my program not to sell books but to make life members. The idea is that in India when we speak of price Rs. 64/ for KRSNA book or say Rs. 30/ for Bhagavad-Gita As It Is, practically their hearts begins to fade because in India most of them are not accustomed to pay so much price but when we speak of membership they agree to contribute very easily because Indian mentality is still charitable toward the cause of spiritual activities. So either reduce the price or not, if we endeavor to create life members it will be easier task. For example you are delivering a set of books; KRSNA, TLC, NOD, Handbook, one copy of BTG and you are taking favor for Rs. 101/ by reduction of price. If you take the real price of these books, it comes to somewhere near Rs. 220/ but if we make a member with the same delivery of books, we get the full membership fee.

Therefore we should contribute more energy for making life members than selling. When there will be no possibility of making members, at that time we can sell books at reduced price. Actually if it is possible to sell 100 sets of books per month, then you can do that. We will discuss the point further upon my arrival in Bombay. Most probably I'll be able to reach Bombay by March 1st. In my next letter I shall let you know.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please send at least 25 membership information pamphlets here immediately.\\
