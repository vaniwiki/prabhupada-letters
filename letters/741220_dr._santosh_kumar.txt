Dear Mr. Kumar,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18, November 1974. I thank you very much for your kind appreciations of our movement. Actually this Hare Krsna Movement is going all over the world, because the message of Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is spoken. I am just like a peon carrying the message of Lord Krsna and Lord Krsna's message, being perfect, it will be appreciated everywhere in any part of the universe. So far others are concerned, as you spoke of Satya Sai Baba, he wants to claim himself as Bhagavan, unfortunately. He can not give any faultless message. The definition of Bhagavan is given in the sastras as one who possesses six kinds of opulences. Nobody is greater than Bhagavan, Krsna. Therefore if we take Krsna's message we will actually be benefited, otherwise not. It will be partial and insufficient. In reply to the last part of your letter I request you to understand properly the message of __Bhagavad-gita__ and other Vedic literatures. You are an educated Indian. According to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhus order every Indian should learn properly the Vedic conclusion and preach all over the world. That is the best welfare activities. You can be very much help to our present activities, so you can be better than others invited from India. I request you to read our books and whenever you find difficulties you can ask me for clearance and it will be my duty to serve you. I thank you once again for your very kind appreciation of our Hare Krsna Movement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
