====== Angelo Cummings ======

My dear Angelo Cummings,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your recent letter (undated), and I was pleased to learn that you are able and willing to help us in our construction plans in New Vrindaban. The construction of the houses is already under way because Nara Narayana has already submitted to me some plans along with an estimate of the needed finances.* Hayagriva is ready to invest the required money, so your cooperation and help will further make easier our attempt. Please therefore cooperate in consultation with Hayagriva who is the chief man in this matter. I shall also be in New York as well as New Vrindaban in the month of April. So if I am present there, I think that your help will be of great value. Actually we want such houses as you have submitted plans for. Nara Narayana is in New York already, so you may consult with him and help him in this attempt by mutual cooperation.

Thanking you once again for your letter. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*I am forwarding your letter & plans to Hayagriva for necessary action
