====== Jadurani ======

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to receive your letter (undated). Yes I am feeling stronger. I always think of you because you are so nice in Krishna Consciousness. Several times I talk about your nice qualifications which you are employing amongst my visitors. Krishna Consciousness is always dormant in everyone's heart & it can be awakened simply by service attitude. You are already allotted a nice service & if you continue this reponsibility anywhere you live & at the same time chant at least 16 rounds a day you will do all right in any circumstances. You have written to say that I am "as hard as the thunderbolt & softer than a rose" is quite right in the line of Krishna Consciousness. I am very sorry to inform you that Kirtanananda is playing the part of a foolish man after his return to N.Y. & it is necessary for me to play the part of a thunderbolt for his nonsense activities. He has unnecessarily instructed something to Damodara which is not sanctioned by me. Since he has developed this nonsensical attitude so much so that he is dictating something which is not sanctioned by me, all his instructions should be neglected. Please inform this to all centers.

Krishna can be present simultaneously everywhere. He lives in His abode Vaikuntha & still he is all pervading. Krishna is never limited by space & time, therefore he can manifest Himself in Casual Ocean as well as in Vaikuntha.

I do no follow why you should feel uneasy in my presence. The easiest thing for you & for all others is to follow my instructions wherever you may be or I may be.

When Rayarama returns tell him that I have seen a copy of BTG. and that I am very pleased with it. Tell him to increase the quality and quantity of BTG. Also ask him to send me as many copies of BTG (at least 3) to this address.
