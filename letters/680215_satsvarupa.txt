====== Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of Feb. 10, 1968, and have noted the contents carefully. The article was very nice, as I have written in Jadurani's letter. And the radio show man is very intelligent, this is good publicity for our movement. And I am happy to hear you are holding Kirtana at so many places, and spreading Lord Caitanya's message.

I was very pleased to hear your statement about the tape, and about Brahmacari life. Yes, the anchor, as in the sketch-story "The Grand Procession" is sex life, and we are 50% liberated if we can make it nil. There isn't any difference between chanting the Holy Name at the same time washing the dishes of the Temple. So do not be worried when you are attracted for doing other work in the Temple. There is variegatedness in transcendental activities. Sometimes we like to chant, sometimes we like to wash dishes. There is no difference on the Absolute plane. I am sure Krishna will give you all intelligence to work transcendentally. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please inform Pradyumna that I shall reply his letter later on. I have received the things wanted by him.
