====== Kirtanananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 22, 1969, and because I went to San Francisco I could not reply earlier. You have suggested that people coming from various centers to New Vrindaban should have their expenses underwritten by the temples at the rate of $25 per person paid for one year. I think that will be a new introduction in our institution. In our so many centers the members go and come, but there was no such demand from any center, and if new Vrindaban demands like that, it will not sound very nice. But I can understand the financial position of New Vrindaban so the best thing will be to stop any more influx in New Vrindaban until the place is self-dependent. The whole idea of New Vrindaban is that men who are living there should produce their own food, of which milk is the principal thing. Unless that position is achieved it will not be advisable to ask anybody to go there. Better to ask them to go there if they are willing to work and produce their own food. Otherwise, nobody should be advised to go there. Besides that, I have received letters from the girls there that they are feeling inconvenience. Therefore, without having adequate place to live there, nobody should be advised at the present moment to go there. I am glad that the boys have been working for the house and the project will be completed satisfactorily. My advice is that you make the place very peaceful. You should admit only such persons who can work without any disturbance. For the time being you may not admit any more men and ask them to pay you $25 per month. That will not sound very nice.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Your last consignment of sandesh was very very nice. Keep this standard and try to make it whiter than this. I had a good taste of them at today's lunch. Thank you. ACB
