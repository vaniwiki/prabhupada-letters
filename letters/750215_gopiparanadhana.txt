My dear Gopiparanadhana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 6th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your problem of not being able to get married, this is not the proper type of question to place before your spiritual master. I think you should discuss this matter with Rupanuga das. Anyway, you should be sure to follow all the regulative principles without fail and to chant at least 16 rounds daily. If you do these things, then in any position of life you will be satisfied. Krishna is fully aware of your every necessity and he will surely provide everything that you need for your bodily maintenance. You should have this kind of faith.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
