====== Yamuna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Yamuna devi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your nice letter of report from Delhi dated November, 1970, and have noted the contents.

I have already written to Gurudasa to try for one very nice Temple in Vrndavana which is in good repair. If we can establish one center there it will be very, very nice. Our foreign devotees must have one very nice place in Vrndavana where they may stay while visiting there and I think this palace of the Maharaja of Bharatapur is just right for us. So you both together work very strenuously in Delhi for making Life Members. That will provide the means for establishing our branches.

Regarding Mr. Gupta, he is an old friend of mine. But I think if you can get him to become our Life Member, you should not expect more than that. That much will be satisfactory.

Regarding the Gaudiya Math, our position has nothing to do with them. They cannot do anything and if somebody does something, they will be envious. That is the nature of third class men. My Guru Maharaja once told this story; one friend informed another that one man has become the High-Court Judge. "Oh no," he replied, "No. That cannot be right." "Yes, he is now a Judge," said the first friend. "I have seen him sitting on the bench." The second man replied, "Maybe. But I don't think he is getting any salary." Such envious men will find out some fault anywhere. There is no fault, actually, but they will manufacture some fault. That is their business. So many persons were envious of my Guru Maharaja, but He was preaching and did not care for them.

Please offer my blessings to all the other devotees with you in Delhi. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
