====== Nitai ======

Vrindaban

My dear Nitai dasa,

Please accept my blessings. Herewith please find the copy of one letter received from Karunasindhu in the matter of asking my permission to allow Purusottama das Brahmacari to scrutinize final printing. The letter has come from Karunasindhu suggested by Kirtiraja. Did you suggest this proposal to Kirtiraja? If not, then please enquire __who__ suggested this proposal to Kirtiraja. I do not like that anyone should scrutinize our publications without my sanction. Kindly enquire into the matter and let me know the report to Bombay address. Also, send me a general report of Vrindaban affairs.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
