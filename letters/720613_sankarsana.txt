My dear Sankarsana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 6, 1972, and I have noted the contents. As for your question regarding the children, what can I do? I am not a teacher. You should ask Satsvarupa on all of these matters, he is the GBC, so everything small and big should be referred to Satsvarupa. First, you should ask the president in charge how to answer these questions. I am feeling the inclination for retiring into the background and simply translating my __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ therefore I have delegated this GBC to manage everything and give me relief. So they shall give you all good guidance, and if there is anything further to know, it is stated that if one is always fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord with full sincerity of attitude, beginning with the tongue, that Krishna will Himself appear to the devotee and all questions will be answered personally by Him. Of course, if there is some very urgent matter, I am always happy to hear from my beloved disciples.

So far your question about jealousy, spiritual jealousy means to think always that the service rendered by such and such devotee is so nice and pleasing to Krishna, so let me try harder to please Krishna than him and then Krishna will notice me also.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
