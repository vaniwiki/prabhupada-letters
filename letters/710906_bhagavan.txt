My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4th September, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far your proposal is concerned, when the vote has been tallied and is presented to me at that time I shall give my approval.

Enclosed herewith please find one letter addressed to me from Karunamoya Prabhu in Amherst. He is planning some college courses and one series of lectures. So you have got good experience in this connection. Give him all good advise on how to make these programs successful. That will be very nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
