====== Letter to: Sudama ======

Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings, and offer the same to your good wife Cintamani devi Dasi. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15th December, 1970---as well as the telegram sent on the 16th December. So far as the 10 copies of Japanese BTG sent by you is concerned, they were received by me some time ago and acknowledged in my letter to you dated 5th December, 1970. This letter was sent to your old address, so perhaps you have received it by now.

I am very glad to learn that Krishna has given you such a nice new temple with so many nice facilities. If you can get one cow that is very auspicious. Then you can have fresh milk and butter. Also the garden mentioned by you should be cultivated. In India the system is that no matter how poor a man is, still, if he has a little land, he can grow some flowers or vegetables and offer to the Deity. In this way take advantage of all that Krishna has so kindly provided. In addition if you can begin production of of spiritual sky incense there, that will be helpful. Your temple can be named as New Gaya.* Gaya is the province where Lord Buddha flourished. Japan is Buddhist country and we accept Lord Buddha as incarnation of God.

So far as Bruce Prabhu is concerned, he may return to Tokyo at any time if you feel that his service is required there. Presently he is in Bombay, so you can write him at our Bombay camp address given above.

I am pleased to learn that you and Bali Mardan are cooperating fully to make our Asian program a success. The two of you are a superexcellent team. I am also appreciating your wonderful enthusiasm for pushing on this movement. Simply be patient and continue in this way with confidence and Krishna will give you all facility.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
