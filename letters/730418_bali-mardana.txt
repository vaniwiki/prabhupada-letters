====== Bali-mardana ======

My dear Bali-mardana Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. For Caitanya-caritamrta 19 pages of manuscript were sent yesterday and today they are sending 30 pages. So you go on making Caitanya-caritamrta and print chapterwise, and that will be very nice.

I am still awaiting quotation from you for Bengali Caitanya-caritamrta and also Gitar Gan. We want to print 50,000 copies of each, in the size just above the smallest size book which you showed me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
