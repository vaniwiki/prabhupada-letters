====== Rupanuga ======

Washington D.C.

My dear Rupanuga das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated August 17 1974 and August 26, 1974 and have noted the contents. As you are appreciating my books, so if all educated people in your country also appreciate, that will expand our missionary activities.

One thing I received one letter from Gurukula regarding the Krsna Bowl contests, and I want you to know that nothing new should be added. Whatever I have introduced should remain. Nothing new should be added. New things means their brain is not clear. Carefully manage things what I have established.

I am glad to learn that in Philadelphia they are increasing Sankirtana. It is our life and soul. Sankirtana should be increased as much as possible. Side by side is book selling. Then our mission will be successful. It is also good that in Atlanta they are doing college courses. Similar attempts should be made in other places.

Regarding the Buffalo project, New Vrindaban is the example. You should develop in a similar way. Have milk, vegetables, simple living, and chanting Hare Krsna. The whole world is engaged in unnecessary hard labor with their factories. It is a brain killing civilization. Let them come to free life. Spend time chanting Hare Krsna, reading books and making their lives successful. This is very essential propaganda. People must be informed.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
