====== Damodara Pandita ======

New Delhi

My dear Damodara Pandita,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26/12/76 and have noted the contents carefully.

You have written that there is one man in Kathmandu who wants to become our devotee. So, take this man's cooperation and start a center. Then even if you are deported, if this couple's attempt is successful, things will go on. If you find him sincere, then we can immediately offer him initiation and he may start the center. Our men may come and go. The program should be the same. Invite persons to love feast, chant Hare Krsna, distribute prasadam. This couple may be in charge of the center. Start with local men, 2, 3, 4, then it will be successful. Take books as much as you like and with the local man's help immediately open a center and try to stay there as long as possible. In your absence the local man may manage. Train him in that way.

Thank you for your nice poem. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
