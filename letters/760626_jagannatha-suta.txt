My dear Jagannatha Suta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the most recent issue of BTG issue #7, and I thank you very much.

I very much like the idea, "Declaring our Dependence on God." The scientists can manufacture a big jet airplane 747, but they cannot manufacture a tiny mosquito, so what is their so-called declaration of independence. You can also run the quotes from the scholar's book reviews as mentioned.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
