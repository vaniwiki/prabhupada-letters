Bombay

My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 6th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the tax question, our Krishna consciousness movement is cultural. We are preaching Bhagavad-gita As It Is. Our mission is to spread the instructions of Krishna so that people may become happy, hopeful, and peaceful. The central point is to understand Krishna as the supreme proprietor, the supreme enjoyer and the best friend of all living beings. He is the best friend of the human society because He gives perfect social order, perfect economic development, perfect philosophy, perfect religion, and perfection of life.

Religion is described in the English dictionary as a kind of faith. Of course when we accept Krishna's instructions perfectly we become automatically perfectly religious person. Therefore Krishna consciousness movement is not a sentimental fanaticism of so-called religion. But, it is the perfect culture for peace and happiness of the whole human society.

I am glad that you had a nice Janmastami celebration in Bombay. Continue your dilligent work, and Krishna will give you all success.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
