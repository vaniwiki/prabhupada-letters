====== Raktaka ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Raktaka,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of September 1st, 1969, and I have noted the contents. For the time being there is no need of going to India. The first thing is that you do not know the Indian language. If you want to be really helpful to the society, at least for the time being you should remain in a place to take training to assist our society's work. I do not know what is the disadvantage for you in Montreal. If you feel some disadvantage, then come to Boston or Los Angeles for some time. In the meantime I am corresponding with Acyutananda in India. If he actually requires some assistance, I shall advise you later on. If you have got money, keep it carefully as it may be required later.

Regarding the two books you have mentioned, __Sri Ramacharitamanasa__ by Goswami Tulasi das is not very authorized, and __Ramayana__ is authorized. One thing is though, you have got enough other books to study. Did you appear in the examination held on Janmastami Day? Why should you go to __Ramayana__ when you have got __Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam__ and __Teachings of Lord Caitanya__? Don't divert your attention in that way. The author of __Ramacharitamanasa,__ Goswami Tulasi das, has a tint of Mayavadi philosophy. He belongs to the Ramananda Sampradaya. They are mixed up combination of personalist and impersonalist. Therefore, the author is not considered as pure Vaisnava. Pure Vaisnava is free from all material contamination of fruitive activities and mental speculation. The pure Vaisnava is simply, purely disposed to transcendental loving service to Krishna. The pure Vaisnava rejects anything which has no pure idea of serving the Personality of Godhead.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
