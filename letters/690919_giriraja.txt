====== Giriraja ======

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 13rd, 1969 along with your check for $20, and thank you very much. I am receiving very encouraging reports from all our centers, including yours, so we should know definitely that Krishna is giving us all opportunities to serve Him more enthusiastically. Actually, the whole universe is Krishna's property. Krishna's devotees are His bona fide officers or sons, so if He likes, He can entrust the whole charge to His devotees immediately. It is not difficult for Him, but He wants to see how His devotees are developing unalloyed Krishna Consciousness.

You are a very nice boy, and by Krishna's Grace you have captured the opportunity, and Satsvarupa is a very good associate for this purpose. So combinedly you try to spread this movement, follow the rules and regulations, chant Hare Krishna, and gradually you will see your life is perfect. So with all my good wishes, offer my blessings to the others. Here in London they had a very nice reception, and the press cutting in one of the papers is sent herewith. The BBC television station very much appreciated our movement, and we were interviewed on one very popular show last Tuesday evening. So things are progressing nicely, and our movement is gradually becoming popular. You will be also glad to know that we have recently opened centers in Tokyo, Denver, and Laguna Beach. Most probably very soon there will be another branch in Chicago. So let us work sincerely, and the requisite money and men will be supplied by Krishna for His service. I think Jadurani is very much busy in painting pictures, otherwise she should have written me some letter by this time.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
