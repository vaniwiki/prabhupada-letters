My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 5, 1975 and have noted the contents. Yes, when you go to the court in Mexico, show them a copy of Professor Stillson Judah's book, "Hare Krishna and the Counterculture", and a copy of the letter from him to me which I have enclosed. Our movement is a genuine movement and we are being accepted as such by the higher educational circles all over the world.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
