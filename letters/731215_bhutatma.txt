====== Bhutatma ======

My dear Bhutatma,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter sated December 11, 1973. I hereby accept the following devotees for first and second initiation as recommended by you:

John - Vatsara dasa

Elena - Kalakantha dasi

Peter - Vatsala dasa

Deborah - Sasikala dasi

Paul - Vatsi das

Cheryl - Kandarpa-sundari dasi

Naomi - Kamalalita dasi

Enclosed find three sacred threads and three gayatri mantras for the second initiates. Hold a fire yajna, after which they may listen to the mantra once through the right ear from from the cassette tape I have have made.

You may send the beads of the first initiates to Kirtanananda Maharaj and send it to me in Los Angeles.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
