Dear Mr. Svoboda:

Please accept my best wishes. Thank you for your letter dated July 25, 1974 and I am glad to know that you have come to appreciate our Krsna consciousness movement and the philosophy we are trying to spread throughout the world. I hope you will try to regularly visit our temple in Toronto and have association of the devotees and attend the classes on the Bhagavad-gita. So far as your translating the Gita, I suggest you write to Hansadutta dasa Adhikari who is in charge of this area of the world. You can get his address at our Toronto temple. He will be able to advise you further in translation work.

Actually not only the problem of nationalism, but every problem of the world is due to a lack of Krsna consciousness. That is the only scarcity. So try to learn this philosophy nicely in association with other devotees and certainly you will be able to do great benefit to your fellow countrymen.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
