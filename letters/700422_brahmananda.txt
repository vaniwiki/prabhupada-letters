====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. Regarding the __Topmost Yoga,__ in the blueprint there are many mistakes. I am pointing out some of them as follows:

Page 2 ". . . decided to kill his sister." not sisters, because only Devaki was there.

"The Lord's compromise was that He had Vasudeva propose to the brother-in-law . . ." This sentence is obscure. The actual fact is Vasudeva made a compromise and said to his brother-in-law, "such and such".

Then everywhere there is yogins, gosvamins, sannyasins, etc. in many places. The "n" is not required---that I have already informed Pradyumna.

On page 17 there is a word "enfuriated"; this is a spelling mistake, it should be "infuriated".

Then on page 48: "on the bank of the Ganges near Didbee". This is not "Didbee", it is "Delhi".

On page 49 there are so many "gosvamins," but there should be no "n."

In this way I have read the book sporadically, not very minutely. I think it should be gone through once more very carefully and all the mistakes that are still existing there should be corrected. If the books are printed with spelling mistakes and other mistakes, that will be a discredit for our publication. So please see that editorial work is done very nicely.

Have you got any information of the Prahlada pictures?* Purusottam got them here last year when I was living at Hayworth Avenue. I thought that the pictures were left here, but Dayananda has no information and nobody can tell where they are. So if you can say if it was returned to New York again, where is it now?

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*I want to publish our book on Prahlada Maharaja with these pictures. ACB
