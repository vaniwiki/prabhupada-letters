====== Letter to: Dayananda ======

My dear Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to have received your letter post-dated May 8th, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. There is a Bengali proverb that it is not wise to pick up quarrel with a crocodile while living in the jurisdiction of the water. Therefore we may agree to the desire of Mr. Spellman to keep peace with him so that in the future if required we may increase the term of lease. But as we are increasing in volume ourselves, it is better to find out a suitable place. We require nice compound around our temple. This will facilitate our work. So as soon as you find a suitable place through Mr. Leo Brown or any other Realtor, I shall return to Los Angeles. For the time being, I shall stay in New Vrindaban, and if I am not called for a London visit, surely I will return to Los Angeles as soon as possible, the latest by the end of June. One thing is though, I am wondering if in July it is very hot in Los Angeles. Please inform me on this point. I am enclosing the papers you sent to me, and you can hand them over to Mr. Spellman without any further delay.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Nandarani, and your nice little daughter. I hope this will find you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
