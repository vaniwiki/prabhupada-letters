====== Mrs. Perera ======

My dear Mrs. Perera,

Please accept my blessings. I wish to thank you for your kind offering which I have duly given to Srimati Radharani. This is the way, to give the very best thing to Radha-Krishna. Decorated with love, Krishna will accept even the humble offering of a leaf, fruit, flower or some water from His devotee. Anyone, anywhere in the world can worship Krishna following this simple formula.

Now you are placed in some awkward circumstances for rendering devotional service as you have mentioned in your letter to me. Devotional service is so powerful that it cannot be stopped in any circumstance. There are histories of many great devotees, like Prahlada Maharaja, who was living in the house of his demon father, Hiranyakasipu. Hiranyakasipu did not even like to hear the name of Krishna, but Prahlada had perfect faith in chanting the Holy Names of the Mahamantra, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, and in this way Krishna saved Prahlada in the end. So please be patient and go on chanting Hare Krishna and try to visit the temple as much as possible. Krishna will offer you all protection and make all suitable arrangements for His devotees to engage in His service. Thank you for your keen interest.

Hoping that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
