====== Syama Sundarji ======

My dear Syama Sundarji,

Please accept my humble obeisances. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 30/10/76 and have noted the contents.

You have given me the credit of being the best disciple of Prabhupada. That is very kind of you, but I am just trying to serve him. Whatever success there is is due to his mercy. In my last meeting with him in Radha Kunda he advised me to print some books if I get money. I took it very seriously and by His grace we have now published my translations of __Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam, Caitanya Caritamrta, Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Upadesamrta,__ etc. to the extent of 84 books. You'll be surprised to know that these books and my magazine __Back To Godhead__ are selling daily 5-6 lakhs of rupees in the foreign countries. Out of such proceeds I am bringing foreign exchange of not less than 10 lakhs per month for construction work in Bombay, Mayapur, Vrndavana, etc. So, this is all due to the blessings of Srila Prabhupada. I have no credit in this connection. These American boys are helping me in this endeavor, therefore, until they are admitted to the Jagannatha Puri temple I'm not inclined to go there.

My disciples are trying for this purpose. The government officials are in favor. Maybe it will be soon.

So far the magazine is concerned, in India it is very difficult to send attractive magazines by post. The peons take it away. I have seen this myself and others have also seen. Therefore, we are publishing one local magazine from Hyderabad. A copy is sent herewith. If you like I can advise the managers in Hyderabad to send you a regular complimentary copy.

By the middle or end of November I may be going to Hyderabad. There we have got 600 acres of land to develop a farm project. We have got one very nice temple in Hyderabad City. As we are doing in Mayapur and many other places, I want to develop self-sufficient centers with cloth and food production by the devotees locally and save time as much as possible to devote themselves to chant Hare Krishna.

I thank you very much for your kindly remembering me. Sometimes I wish to take Jagannatha prasada, because nowadays I have no appetite here. I went to Jagannatha Puri in 1958 during some special function. I was taking Lord Jagannatha prasada very sumptuously. I am praying to Lord Jagannatha to take me there again at His will and honor His remnants of food.

Hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
