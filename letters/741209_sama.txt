====== Letter to: Sama ======

Glyndon, Maryland

My dear Sama das Adhikari:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 9, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to know that you are preaching there in Baltimore, and there is no question of bigness or smallness of the center so far pleasing me is concerned. It is the sincerity of the attempt that is the important thing. Of course as Krsna sees the sincerity of our hearts, He supplies the facilities. Just like I came to your country with only Rs. 40/-, and now we have got this huge institution. So you can be sure that Krishna will supply you according to your capacity. So I think that if you continue working sincerely, you will get all facilities that you require for your purposes.

Upon your recommendation I have accepted the following as my disciples and their names are as follows: Tim---Tarakara dasa; Dorinda---Dainyahrt devi dasi. Their beads may be chanted upon by Kirtanananda Swami or Tamala Krishna Goswami.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
