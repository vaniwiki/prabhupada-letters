My dear Sat Krita dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated June 23, 1975 and have noted the contents. I have organized the GBC for the purpose of spreading Krsna consciousness all over the world. In this way I am trying to become free from the management in order to translate my books. Therefore there is no need to form a separate new committee of 64 members. Let each zone and center push on in their area of the world. If such an international committee is to be formed, it can be done by the GBC. You can make your further suggestions to Jagadisa.

I am glad your son is doing well in Gurukula.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
