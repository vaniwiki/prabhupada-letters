====== Letter to: Karunasindhu, Kirtiraja ======

My dear Karanasindhu and Kirtiraja das:

Please accept my blessings. you should immediately write one letter to Purusottam das in Vrindaban saying that you are not interested in his work nor do you require his help; and whatever books he has got of ours in his possession he may return to our Vrindaban center immediately.

A copy of your letter should be sent to me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
