====== Janardana ======

My dear Janardana,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter of April 27,1967 and have noted the contents carefully. My first instruction to you is that you must pass your M.A. Examination before any other consideration. Your degree will be a great asset for the society in the near future. So this is your first consideration. Regarding returning the money you do not bother much. Your good wife gave in loan to the society $300.00 and she must have the money returned. So do not bother about it. The society will return the money to N.Y. conveniently. There is no immediate necessity.

Regarding my Canadian Visa, I shall go to Montreal when you are confident of getting it there. Otherwise I shall lose the U.S.A. Visa also. So conveniently you try to get information from the right source and the best thing will be to get me as a teacher as you suggested in your previous letter. So far I am personally concerned either I remain here or there my business is to chant the glories of Lord Krishna. Wherever I get chance to chant is good for me. I have no idea for sight seeing in any country because I know that all land belong to Krishna and anywhere I remain I remain at His Lotus Feet. But if you think my presence in Montreal will be good for the Branch there I am prepared to go there any moment you ask me to go at all risk even if I am bereft of the U.S. visa. I do not mind it. Offer my blessing to all devotees there and your good wife.

Yours ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
