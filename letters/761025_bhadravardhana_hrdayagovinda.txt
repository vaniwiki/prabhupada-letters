====== Bhadravardhana, Hrdayagovinda ======

My dear Bhadravardhana and Hrdayagovinda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated October 1, 1976 along with a check for $350. Thank you very much.

Please perform your service of training up the new men very carefully. Present the philosophy of Krsna consciousness as it is. There is no need to add anything or take anything away. As it is. They must learn to strictly follow the four regulative principles and chant 16 rounds minimum every day, avoiding the 10 offenses. The new men should also go out for samkirtan, chanting or distributing my books. This will make them strong. Also, they must study my books at least three hours a day (including classes).

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
