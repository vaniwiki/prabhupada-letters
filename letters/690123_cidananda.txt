====== Cidananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 21, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. Since receiving this letter I have learned that you have decided that it is best that you do not leave your position in the San Francisco temple for the press department in New York. I think that this is the correct decision because your presence is very much needed in your temple. I am always glad to know that you are there to help manage the affairs of the San Francisco center so I am glad that you have decided to remain there as president. There are many places in San Francisco who will advertise in our __Back To Godhead,__ so as much as possible you may try for this. But one thing is that the brahmacaris who are there must help in supporting the temple so you will have adequate time for this added responsibility upon you. So those who are able to earn money for supporting the temple must assist you in this connection.

I am very happy to learn that you are seriously negotiating to purchase the new house. But one thing is that if for one year there are people having regular meeting in our temple room with all of their smoking and other nonsense, I do not think this will be very good. In the meantime, you may continue to make negotiations, but if this condition cannot be changed I do not think the arrangement will be very satisfactory. I am so pleased to learn that Mulji bhai is so enthusiastic to help us in purchasing the house, and he is anxious to go from door to door to raise the money for helping in this way. Please encourage him because even this one building is not suitable then surely Krishna will supply us with some other house for our temple activities.

So I am fully aware that you are working very sincerely in Krishna Consciousness, and when difficulties arise you must simply remember to continue to depend upon Krishna, and He will supply you with the intelligence to solve any problems. You have already proven yourself as a very nice servitor of Lord Caitanya and I am always praying to Him that He will allow you to advance more and more in His eternal service.

Please continue to keep me informed about the activities in your temple. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
