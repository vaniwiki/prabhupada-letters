My dear Satsvarupa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your GBC monthly report for August dated September 7, 1975 and have noted the contents. I have received a copy of the review written by the Cornell professor and it is very encouraging. I am having them reproduce it here for distribution to the libraries in India. I have also requested Ramesvara to make a booklet of all these reviews.

I'm glad to hear that Miami has got their new property and temple. I understand they have many mango trees there. When is the mango season there in Florida? I am very fond of mangoes and when they are produced on our own property, then they become more palatable. It is a fact that if you purchase fruit in the market, it is not as palatable as if it comes from your own tree. Even Caitanya Mahaprabhu's devotees were very fond of mangoes. Caitanya Mahaprabhu, He immediately produced one mango tree at the house of Srinivasa and He was daily distributing mangoes.

Regarding Houston temple, it is best thing if they recruit their own men as the other temples are doing. I find that in the United States and also in Europe there are many Indians in every city. Encourage them to take part in our programs.

Regarding St. Louis, I know that Makhanlal is a very good boy. Perhaps it is better for him not to have such a wife. I thank you very much for your report. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
