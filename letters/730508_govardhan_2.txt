====== Govardhan 2 ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Govardhan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 3, 1973.

Upon your recommendation I am glad to accept these devotees as my initiated disciples. So now you may hold a fire yajna and send their beads to Kirtanananda Swami for chanting. Also I give approval for the one brahminical initiation. Please find one Gayatri mantra enclosed. After the fire yajna you may play the tape of me chanting Gayatri mantra into the right ear in private. Teach how to count on the finger divisions.

I am enclosing a letter to all the new initiates.

Please preach this Krsna Consciousness very strongly so that we may give people real light for seeing the way out of the darkness of Kali Yuga. The modern scientists are confusing everyone with their false propaganda and it is our duty to expose them and kill the demoniac tendency to forget Krsna.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
