====== Gargamuni ======

Calcutta

My dear Gargamuni Svami

Please accept my blessings. I am writing you regarding 8,000 dollars that was sent from Ramesvara for the Mayapur Temple Kitchen. I received notice that the money was sent before December 15th, 1974. Have you not received it yet? When you had not received any money for the construction, you sent a threatening letter. Now money is there and you are silent. Why don't you inform us?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
