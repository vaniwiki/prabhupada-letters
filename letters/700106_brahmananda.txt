====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. Since I have come here, I have not heard anything from you. Hope you are doing well along with all other devotees. I heard from Gargamuni that you have received some letter from the draft board accepting our society as religious. I am anxious to see the letter.

In the meantime, I have received one letter from Syamasundara that the amount that George Harrison wants to donate for printing of my __Krishna__ (19,000 dollars) had some difficulty for paying directly cash. Therefore, his lawyer, Mr. Allen Klein, has advised him some device. I have already written him a letter in this connection, the copy of which is enclosed, please find. With this copy of this letter, in which you are authorized to represent me, you can see Mr. Allen Klein and do the needful.

I have also not heard anything about my bank balance in the F.N. City Bank. Please make my pass book up to date and let me know what is the balance. Also write to me all other interesting news which you may have by this time. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
