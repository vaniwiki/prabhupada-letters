====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

Montreal

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter dated 16th April, 1970, with an enclosed check for $15 on the temple account in India, Mayapur. Thank you very much for your first contribution.

I am very glad to learn that you are doing spiritual activities very nicely and you are always alert to see whether you are committing some offense. This is a very nice attitude. In rendering service to Lord Krsna and His representative the Spiritual Master, we should always maintain this fearful attitude which means careful attention. This attitude will advance you progressively in Krishna Consciousness.

Regarding the French edition BTG, your attempt is coming to be successful and the present copy looks very nice. Regarding Sanskrit, you can learn it in your leisure time. For Indians it is not difficult to learn Sanskrit.

So, whether you have decided to marry in this country or in India? I think you can marry some girl in the Western country who is in Krishna Consciousness, but if you want to marry in the presence of your parents in India, that is a different thing. In our Society there are many nice girls, so if you decide to marry here, then I can ask somebody to correspond with you. What is you age at present?

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
