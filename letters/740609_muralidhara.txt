My dear Muralidhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of May 16, received only now in Paris.

Regarding your questions for painting: The enclosed sketch of Lord Visnu visiting the sacrificial arena of Maharaja Prthu is all right as it is, the architecture is nice. Visnu should rest His left hand on Garuda's shoulder. But in the picture of the four kumaras visiting Prthu Maharaja, why are the Kumaras seen as if coming through the ceiling from above? I think it would be better if they were coming inside through the doorway.

I am sorry to hear of your wife's poor health. You have tried so many treatments, pills and better climates and visits to doctors, but there is no improvement. I think you can admit her to the hospital on a longer term basis for recooping her health. You should not expect to have children until she is in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
