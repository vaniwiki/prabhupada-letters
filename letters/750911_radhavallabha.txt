====== Radhavallabha ======

Los Angeles

My dear Radhavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter dated August 31, 1975 regarding the calculation of my birthday. The system for calculating is as follows: the first day of birth is the first birthday. The next year that day is the second birthday; i.e. the second birthday means that one year has been completed. So it is my 80th birthday, and I have completed 79 years.

According to the Hindu system, on the first birthday there is __jata karma__ ceremony and all big, big astrologers assemble and give the horoscope. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam the birthday of Maharaja Pariksit is there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
