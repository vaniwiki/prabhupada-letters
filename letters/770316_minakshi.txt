====== Letter to: Minakshi ======

Toronto

My dear Minakshi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your nice letter dated March 3, 1977. From your letter I can understand that you and your brother Indresh are both great devotees. You are very fortunate to have devotee parents and from your very childhood take to Krishna consciousness. I also had the good fortune to have a devotee father and mother and when I was young they gave me Radha Krishna to worship and I was also performing Rathayatra festival with my young friends. I am always thinking of you and your brother, what nice devotees you are. Please continue with your service to Srimate Tulsi devi and to Radha and Krishna and your life will be sublime.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
