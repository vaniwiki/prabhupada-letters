====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter dated February 10, 1969, and I am very glad to learn that your Sankirtana Party is taking shape, and you hope to inaugurate the on the streets program in a few weeks. Now you should also start program for selling our __Back To Godheads__ along with the Sankirtana as Tamala Krishna is doing here. Along with Sankirtana Party, they are selling daily not less than 100 copies. Sometimes the sale is 120-30 copies. Besides that, Purusottama is distributing __Back To Godhead__ to some distributer in Los Angeles. My next program is to distribute at least 20,000 copies of Back To Godhead from four centers, namely New York, London, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. So each of these centers will contribute $750 and they will get 5,000 copies free delivery to destination. That means they will get the copies at 15 cents each, and the price fixed up will be 50 cents. So even by wholesale distribution the centers will get at least 30 cents per copy, and that means a 15 cents profit. If all the 5,000 copies are not sold, then we shall distribute the remaining copies to schools, colleges, libraries, institutions, etc. free of charges. This propaganda has to begin __immediately.__ Please let me know your opinion. Los Angeles has already agreed, and I am very much encouraged. I hope you will also agree and encourage me. So on receipt of your confirmation, I shall immediately arrange for printing 20,000 copies beginning from the latest April, 1969.

Regarding publication of __Easy Journey To Other Planets,__ I can __immediately__ give you a lengthy introduction essay addressed to the sympathetic nondevotee, or for that matter, even for the unsympathetic nondevotee. I shall add two or three essays like "Krishna Consciousness, the Genuine Yoga System," and "An Introduction to Krishna." In so many ways I can fill up the required necessary pages. Just today I have received from Hayagriva one nicely edited copy of __Easy Journey.__ It is about 50 type-written pages, double-spaced. If Mr. Maschler is serious, then let me know, and I will send this manuscript along with essays to fill up the required number of extra pages. Similarly, Purusottama has learned of some big publishers in New York who may be interested in publishing some yoga cook books, so if you will __immediately__ send him a description of the cook book you have there, he will contact these publishers to see if they are interested.

It is very nice that you have already filled application to be company, and the office bearers mentioned there is all right. So I shall be glad to know when you open a bank account. You can register three signatures, and out of the three, two have to sign. You wrote to say that you can show Mr. Maschler our essays in __Back To Godhead,__ so you can __immediately__ show him __Isopanisad__ which is published in issue #22. I am encouraged that Mr. Maschler has become friend of our movement, and if we get a sympathetic English publisher, we can publish so many small booklets through him. I am also pleased that Mr. Parikh is taking active interest, and I am simply anxious when you will have nice premises for our temple. Please let me know what is the result of the Camden Borough Council negotiations. Regarding the picture you have sent, I am so pleased to see it, because our little Sarasvati is also taking part in our transcendental movement. That is the practical proof how great is this movement. In any other movement, one has to learn something, one has to be trained to do something, but here is a movement where there is no necessity of any previous qualifications. That is the proof this movement is based on the spiritual platform. The __Bhagavata__ says that system of religion is the first class wherein love of Godhead is aroused spontaneously without any material impediment. So our movement gives practical proof that there is no impediment of body or mind. That is the proof it is enacted from the spiritual platform wherein there is no distinction of material higher or lower gradation. So we have to push our philosophy very nicely. This means we shall simply become sincere to Krishna and the teachings of the disciplic succession. Then everything will be all right. There is no doubt about it. So please keep yourself in your present standard, and I am sure you will come out successfully. I have learnt that in San Francisco there was an article published with the title, "Krishna Chant Startles London." You may ask Aniruddha to send you a copy of this.

Please offer my blessings to the other boys and girls there. I am awaiting your early reply.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have just received one letter from Gurudasa but have received no copy of the Police order.
