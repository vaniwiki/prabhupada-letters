====== Krsna dasa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 25, 1969, and I beg to inform you that both Saradia and Vaikunthanatha are doing well in Boston. I hope you have sent her a letter of congratulations by now. When I was in Montreal Saradia expressed her desire to marry Vaikunthanatha, and immediately I asked that he would remain reserved for her. He is a very nice boy, and I hope they will be happy in their future homely life in Krishna Consciousness. I have received also news from Mandali Bhadra and Vrndavanesvari that they have already purchased their tickets and are going on the 27th of June, so when they arrive, please cooperate with them nicely. You are all sincere workers, and they also are very sincere souls. So cooperate together nicely, and I hope our Hamburg center will very soon become the important center in Europe. In London they have not yet been able to find out a suitable place, but still they are prepared to celebrate the Rathayatra Festival there. But so far I have received no definite information on this festival. Under the circumstances I am not yet certain whether or not I shall go to London, but in your letter under reply you have expressed the desire of my going to Germany, so do you think you are able to receive me there at the present stage? My going to Germany means lots of expenditures, including travel fare, etc. If you think that you will be able to meet these expenditures, then I have no objection for going there directly.

From your report of sales of the __Peace Formula__ it appears that when you get __Back To Godhead__ printed in German language it will be very nicely distributed. I can see that Jaya Govinda is a great asset to your center and there will be no difficulties for printing matter. He is expert in that line, and he and Rayarama worked for many months in connection with __Back To Godhead__ here in New York.

In hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
