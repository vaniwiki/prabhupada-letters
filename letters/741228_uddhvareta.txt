====== Uddhvareta ======

Los Angeles

My dear Uddhvareta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents carefully.

Regarding your proposal, I shall have to consult the GBC men first before making that decision. I have sent your proposal to Jayatirtha Prabhu and have asked him to make copies and send it to the GBC men and have them give opinions. Then send these opinions to myself. Then I will give my judgement, after hearing those opinions. I am always praying to Krsna that my disciples will not fall away from the path of Krsna Consciousness. In the Bhagavad-gita it says; __bahunam janmanam ante__ [[books:bg:7:19|(Bg. 7.19)]]. After many many births one finally comes unto Me. Sa mahatma sudurlabhah, such a great soul is very rare. My simple request is that you very strictly follow all of our regulative principles without any deviation whatsoever. And thus by example show others how to do the same. Engage in devotional service according to your propensity and the direction of my appointed authorities. Always pray to Krsna so that He may keep you engaged in His transcendental service. Avoid the service of Maya like poison.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
