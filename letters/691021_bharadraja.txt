====== Bharadraja ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bharadraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 4, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. I hope by now your bodily ailment is subsiding. Regarding the diet which the doctors are giving you, it is all right if you do not take milk for some time. Vegetables will do. Regarding your going to Santa Barbara to help open a center there, this idea is all right. Consult with Tamala Krishna in this matter. You have got good ideas, you are intelligent and have got qualifications, but you must learn to be more responsible. I was not very happy when I saw your wife last. She is so nice girl. You are married; you must be responsible for the maintenance of your wife. As you are qualified, you can work as a musician; but you must maintain her nicely and help her to progress in Krishna Consciousness. So far as the musical group you have described in your letter, you may consult with Tamala Krishna and see what his idea is in this connection. I cannot advise in this matter.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
