My Dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings. Since you have gone I have not heard from you, neither do I know whether the property is purchased. I have not heard anything from Kirtanananda also. So I am anxious to know whether the festival in New Vrndavana will take place.

It is already announced in the circular letter regarding the Constitution that the meeting will take place in New Vrndavana. I have also promised that I shall go to New Vrndavana. So if everything is fixed up, then you can send me the travelling tickets.

Further, if I go to New Vrndavana I wish to go via Boston so that I may be able to see the temple and the press while going on the East side.

So kindly treat this as urgent and let me know your decision.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
