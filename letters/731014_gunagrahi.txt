====== Letter to: Gunagrahi ======

Buffalo

My dear Gunagrahi Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 29, 1973 and have noted the contents. I thank you for your very nice report. I am glad that you held very nice Rathayatra in Buffalo and have donated one calf to New Vrindaban.

Krsna has given you nice opportunity to preach the philosophy so you must be sure to understand it rightly. Everything is given in my books for you. So go on with your travelling and preaching program and you can count on it that Krsna will give you all facility.

Regarding the initiations, I am pleased to accept on your recommendation the following devotees as my disciples:

Bhavanasini dasi---Donna\\
Bhaktanidhi dasi---Lindsay

See to it that they are engaged in Krsna's service, following the rules and regulations, and always chanting Hare Krsna. You can have Rupanuga das Goswami chant on their beads. .

I hope this meets you in good health.
