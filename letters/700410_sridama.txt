My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings. I am so pleased to receive your letter dated 4th April, 1970, and I am very glad to read the contents.

I am very glad that you are going to marry Manmohini Dasi and I have got my full sanction and blessings for this unity. Nanda Kisora and his wife and yourself and your wife, four together, organize the center in Providence which is already wonderful and by your propaganda of Krsna Consciousness it will be heavenly.

As soon as a center is open and my disciples conduct it nicely, it gives me Vaikuntha bliss. Vamanadeva is doing very nicely in St. Louis, and I am sending herewith some pictures of his activities. So Bali Mardan and Upendra are doing in Sydney also. All these newses are to me life-giving ambrosia, so the more you open branches, the more I increase my duration of life. Therefore, if you all my students want me to live for some days more, go on opening nice branches as many as possible.

Be happy in Krsna Consciousness and keep me informed about your activities. Thanking you once more. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
