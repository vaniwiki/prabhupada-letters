====== Letter to: Kirtanananda ======

Dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your requests for initiations of devotees at New Vrindaban, contained in your letter of December 30, 1973.

Upon your recommendation I am glad to accept the disciples for first initiation, and their spiritual names are as follows:

Susan Burchell---Madanalasa dasi

Jim Newsham---Jayanta dasa

Evelyn Newsham---Candrarekhika dasi

Sandra Chiefa---Kunjari dasi

Haynes Busby---Hari-dhama dasa

You may chant on their beads and instruct them seriously to always chant at least 16 rounds daily and obey the regulative principles. Only in this way is spiritual advancement possible.

Your recommendations for second initiation, Taru das, Radhanath das and Parambrahma das are accepted by me and their sacred threads and gayatri mantras are enclosed. See that they hear the mantra from the tape I have made, and have them hear it in their right ear. Give them further instructions on standards of a Brahman. Thank you for the daksina check for one hundred dollars.

Go on developing New Vrindaban: next month I am coming there. Is my apartment completed?

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
