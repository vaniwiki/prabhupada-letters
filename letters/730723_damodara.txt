====== Damodara ======

<card class="letter">
Dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of you letter dated July 19, 1973 and I have carefully considered the contents.

Yes, I have recently received a full report from Rupanuga Maharaja on the activities of the Washington D.C. and especially how you are most enthusiastic about book distribution and that you are fixing to purchase the house. I am very glad that you are taking so seriously your duty as president of our D.C. center, so certainly Krsna will give you all assistance in your preaching mission.

On your recommendation, I have chanted on the threads enclosed for second initiation of Dharmapada and Varuna das, and I have enclosed gayatri mantras as well for Rupa Manjari, Rambhavati and Vilasi as well. You may play the tape of my speaking the gayatri mantra into their right ear and instruct them in the principles of brahminical culture.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
