====== Charles (Krsna Balarama) ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Charles, (Krishna Balarama das)

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your very nice letter dated 18th April, 1977.\\
We are not concerned with the skin but with the soul. As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita As It Is:

> "vidya-vinyaya-sampanne
> brahmane gavi hastini
> suni caiva svapake ca
> panditah sama-darsinah"
> [[books:bg:5:18|(Bg. 5.18)]]

"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater (outcaste)."

So Krsna consciousness means not to make any distinctions of black or white, Christian or Muslim or Hindu, African, American or Indian. Krsna claims everyone as His son. This movement of Krsna consciousness is an attempt to enlighten the whole world on the spiritual platform. We are trying to do this. Please try to help us. By your letter, you appear to be a very intelligent young man. Try to understand this whole philosophy and work cooperatively with Brahmananda Swami to spread Krsna consciousness to all of your countrymen.\\
Your letter is so nice that I have asked that it be published in our Back to Godhead magazine. Thank you very much for your nice sentiments. I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
