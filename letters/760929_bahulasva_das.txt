My dear Bahulasva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3rd inst. and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for the check of $2500.00. Yes, farm-opening, that is good idea. Apart from my Krishna Consciousness spiritual movement I want this--that people may not move from the villages to the town. Krishna Himself was a villager-He did not move to the town. He went to Dvaraka, but Vasudeva is everywhere; Krishna and Balaram like Vrindaban, so Vrindaban means village. Vasudeva is everywhere, but Krishna personally is in Vrindaban.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your every well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
