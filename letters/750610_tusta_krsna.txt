====== Letter to: Tusta Krsna ======

Auckland, New Zealand

My dear Tusta Krishna Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. I accept Kerry Welsh for 1st initiation. His name is Krodhaha dasa. You can give him the name at his ceremony. Keep on preaching. Preaching is our life. Introduce our books, then everyone can understand, if he has good brain. I shall be leaving Hawaii on the 20th of June for LA.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
