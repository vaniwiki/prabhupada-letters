====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am pleased to inform you that our journey from New York to Hamburg was very comfortable, and we safely arrived at the scheduled time. The boys were present to receive us, and the apartment they have selected is very nice. I am sending herewith a letter addressed to Hayagriva. The second part of the Ginsberg conversation article should not be published, and our policy should be to only publish our Krishna Consciousness articles in various forms. We are not concerned with any other movement save and except Krishna Consciousness in its pure form. In India it is said that a little bit of a pure thing is much better than huge volumes of impure, adulterated things. So please try to follow this policy and publish in __BTG__ only pure Krishna Conscious articles.

Regarding press starting, I have already given you necessary instructions, and again I say that you complete it as soon as possible. I wish to see the press is started when I go back to USA after my European tour, probably in the beginning of November. I received a note from one girl, Gita Rajput, and I am enclosing it herewith for your reference. If she comes to decorate in the temple, encourage her because a little service to Lord Krishna will protect one from the greatest calamity. That is the version of __Bhagavad-gita.__

I think establishment of the Deities here will not be possible because the place is not very settled up. There is objection by the health department for performing kirtana. Anyway, they are doing very nicely, and in Monday's meeting one Dr. Franz Bernhard, a learned scholar in Indology, was there, and he is very interested in our movement. Yesterday I had discussion with him for about two hours and he is impressed, as you will find I have explained to Hayagriva in his letter. Please note also the items I have requested Hayagriva to bring here when he comes.

I hope you are doing well, and I shall be glad to hear good news from you by return of post.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have got now connection with a firm dealing in musical instruments in Delhi. I think they are better than Dwarkin and Sons\\
P.S. Hand over to Hayagriva the enclosed letter. I didn't know where else to send it to him.
