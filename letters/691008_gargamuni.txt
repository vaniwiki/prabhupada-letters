====== Gargamuni ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated September 24th, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to learn that you liked that picture which was printed in the London newspaper, and I have got the original of this picture, given to me by the reporter. If there is somebody there who could paint it, then it may be sent to Los Angeles. Regarding MacMillan, I have already asked Brahmananda to make the arrangements complete for publishing the First Canto of __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ So far as supplies from India are concerned, Ranjit Mullick will be able to supply you with these. You may open correspondence with him, and the copy of his letter along with my reply is enclosed herewith for your reference. It is settled up that he will purchase from the best sources and charge 10% on the purchase price. So you can ask him for the purchase invoice, and that will be nice. First of all ask him to send samples. Then begin business. Unless you are satisfied with the price and sample, don't put any order. Acyutananda is very simpleton, and it is very easy to cheat him. That is the past experience. I have seen the label for The Spiritual Sky and it is very nice.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
