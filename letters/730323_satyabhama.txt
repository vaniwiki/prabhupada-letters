====== Letter to: Satyabhama ======

My dear Satyabhama:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 20, 1973 and I am replying late because of so much recent travelling. I am here for a few days only, then to Bombay and on the 1st to London for a few days before going on to L.A. via New York.

Actually, I don't want our energy spent in that way, to develop a school at New Vrndavana. Rather, all of our children should go to Dallas when they are four and begin their training program there. In Dallas, they have full facility approved by me, I have personally seen that they are doing very nicely there. So, for the younger children to be at New Vrndavana that is alright, but when they are a little older, at four, they should go on to our Dallas facility.

Why should the parents not feel attachment for their children, that is natural. But our affection is not simply sentimental, we offer our children the highest opportunity to become trained up in Krsna consciousness very early so as to assure their success in this life to go back to Godhead for sure. That is real affection, to make sure my child gets back to Godhead, that is my real responsibility as a parent. And I have seen that Gurukula offers this opportunity more than any other place anywhere. So I think that you are intelligent girl, and you can explain it to others in this way.
