====== Smaranananda (Von Paul Read), Samsara-mocana (Barbara Read), Bhubhrta (Bob Quirk), Pavana (Jeffrey Spicher), Devadeva (Royal Frank Affrisco), Daivata (Anthony Burt Alves), Parayana (Laurel Alves) ======

My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Makhanlal I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Von Paul Read/SMARANANANDA DAS\\
Barbara Read/SAMSARAMOCHAN DASI\\
Bob Quirk/BHUBHRTA DAS\\
Jeffrey Spicher/PAVANA DAS\\
Royal Frank Affrisco/DEVADEVA DAS\\
Anthony Burt Alves/DAIVATA DAS\\
Laurel Alves/PARAYANA DASI

I am so glad to learn that all of you have been such a great help to Makhanlal there in our Seattle center. I can understand that all of you are very sincere boys and girls and are very eligible candidates for going back to Home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet all of you in good health and determined spirits.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
