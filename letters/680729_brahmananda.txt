====== Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. Krishna will save you do not worry. Let us forget about our past incidents with Hayagriva and Kirtanananda. Treat Kirtanananda as bona fide and address him as Kirtanananda Maharaja. He should be first offered obeisances and he will return the respect to his Godbrothers. I am expecting you here as Vamana das has informed me. The strike is still going on. If you do not come then talk with me by phone. Please be brotherly with Hayagriva and Kirtanananda. They have come back with sincerity. Hope you are all well. I am fit.
