My dear Sriman Pranava das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 28th March and I have noted the contents.

Last time when I was in Vrindaban I saw both the lands and we decided that we shall take both of them. The first land which is front side four bighas on the road and six bighas behind, if they are prepared to give us the land for payment of Rs 28,000.00 or less we can take. That we settled up last time. And in between the two lands, the two bighas that also we can take never mind the land is rough, still we are prepared to take it.

The other land, twenty bighas, ten bighas in front and ten bighas at the rear can be taken at a total price of Rs 70,000.00 or utmost, Rs 75,000.00. In this way, if the land is available we are prepared to pay immediately. You have suggested it will cost Rs 90,000.00 but that is too much. The front portion at Rs 4,000 and the rear at 3,000, so 70,000 or utmost 75,000. So if they are prepared, arrange for the purchase of the land. My money will be ready the second of May. You can do the needful.

In Bombay we are meeting the opposition peacefully and I hope things will come out successfully. Kindly ask Tejyas to send me a statement of account of Delhi, in the name of Vrindaban Construction Fund, Punjab National Bank.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
