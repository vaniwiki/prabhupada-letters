My dear Mahamsa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9 December 1975.

I am pleased to note that everything is progressing nicely. Regarding the loan you do not have to repay it immediately, but as soon as possible.

Naturally the sankirtana men traveling with the bullock carts are blissful. It is Lord Caitanya's engagement. Lord Caitanya personally traveled all over India for 6 years. His program was simply kirtana and prasadam distribution. Lord Caitanya never spoke philosophy in public. When he met big scholars like Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya he spoke philosophy, otherwise for the mass of people, kirtana and prasadam distribution. So continue this program, it is very pleasing to Lord Caitanya.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
