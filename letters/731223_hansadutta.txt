====== Hansadutta ======

Heidelberg, West Germany

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 15, 1973. Previously I have seen copy of German Easy Journey to Other Planets. It is very nice. The printing is very good and I am quite pleased. Thank you very much for helping me spread this transcendental knowledge to the Germanic peoples. It is a great credit for you and all the German devotees and Lord Caitanya will bless you with devotion to His lotus feet. I am very anxious to see our Bhagavad-gita in German so as soon as it is completed, kindly send me a copy. Regarding the Volkswagen bus, if it is not possible to bring in March to India then it can be brought at a later date. Yes, you should go to London and give me a report on the progress there. Mukunda and Madhavananda are sincere workers and are trying to organize things there. So you may go and help them, not interrupt but help.

I gladly accept the devotees you have recommended for initiations and enclosed find their names, threads and gayatri mantra sheets. You may chant on the beads of the first initiates and hold a fire sacrifice amongst our members. After that the second initiates may listen to the gayatri tape I have made through the right ear once only. Hare Krsna.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
