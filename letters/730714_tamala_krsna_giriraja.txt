Bombay

Dear Tamala Krsna Maharaja and Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. When I was leaving Calcutta I received your phone call mentioning that Mrs. Nair was eager to settle up the Juhu affair but since then I have not heard anything from you whether she is actually serious or whether she has given anything in writing. If she has not given anything in writing there is no value of her verbal statements. All settlement must be made very carefully. In the meantime, I have sent one letter to the Central Bank of India regarding our Bhaktivedanta Book Trust account. A copy of that letter is enclosed. Please do the needful.

Since I have come here to Letchmore Heath, I am improved in my health more than in India. The place is very calm and quiet. It is sufficiently spacious also. I walk within the village daily in the morning along with devotees and it is very pleasant. I am holding morning class from 7-8 A.M. So things are going on nicely. . There are about 40 devotees living with me, similarly there are 30 devotees in 7 Bury Place. Sometimes I go there. Things are being managed there nicely. So I shall be glad to hear about Bombay affairs and as you send me every month statements of Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, kindly send me that also. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
