My dear Atreya Rsi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far your service is concerned, you should understand that Krishna's service is absolute. Anything you do for Krishna in the standard of Krishna's service is Krishna also. So cleansing Krishna's temple and working on the altar of Krishna, etc. there is no difference. So don't consider in Krishna's service that something is higher and something is lower. Neither Krishna's servants are materially superior or inferior. So you should stick to your present service. That will be very nice.

Now immediately we have got a very big project to construct a temple at Mayapur, the birth site of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. So you can contribute the sums for our Mayapur construction scheme. Sannyasis should not be given any money. They should manage themselves and maintain themselves by taking small alms from different persons---not a lump sum from one person.

It is very much pleasing to me that you are so much sacrificing everything for Krishna. Krishna will surely bless you. You can open better a Mayapur construction scheme fund and deposit as much money as possible there and in due course we shall withdraw it. The estimate for the project is Rupees 40 lakhs (Rs. 4,000,000) which in ordinary exchange comes to $500,000. So you can deposit in this fund as much as possible. That will be very nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
