====== Prabhavisnu ======

London

My dear Prabhavisnu das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and accept upon your recommendation the following as my initiated disciples. For first initiation, their spiritual names are as follows: Martin Webster---Akhandadhi; Gordon Stocker---Prithvipati; John Morgan---Dharanidhara; Frank Jokson---Yajnanga; Terry Maloncis---Ādi Kurma; Lynn Avionis---Sri Kama dasi. I also accept the following as twice-born brahmanas and their threads and mantra sheets are enclosed: Krpamoya das, Yasodadulal das, Sarvasagara das, Gokulananda das; Ragudvaha das, Cittavinodama das, Vamsivadana das, Anjana devi dasi. You should have a fire sacrifice and the second initiates should hear through the right ear the mantra on my recorded tape. The beads may be chanted upon by Hansadutta. It is your responsibility to see that these devotees that you have recommended strictly follow the rules and regulations, chanting 16 rounds, attending the classes and the mangala aroti and refraining from the four prohibitions. You should lecture on these points at the initiation ceremony so that everyone understands fully. And by your own example you should teach.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
