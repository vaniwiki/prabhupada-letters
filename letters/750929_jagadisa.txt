My dear Jagadisa das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 19, 1975 with enclosed photographs and map. The property is very nice. You should take it immediately. Make some bargain as far as possible to get the best price, and take it. We shall try to get the money. Ask Ramesvara. He is now getting money from book distribution, so money is coming. I do not know if the centers can contribute. 40 centers would have to contribute U.S. 5,000 each to raise U.S. 200,000. As far as taxing the centers for the maintenance, that should be considered amongst the GBC.

It is a good idea to also have the Vedic Institute there also on this property. So negotiate and develop it cojointly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. What will you do with the old building?\\
