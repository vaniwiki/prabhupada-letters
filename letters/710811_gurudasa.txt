Calcutta

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to draw your attention to my last letter to you dated 28th July in which I pointed out that so many things are undone in India. Therefore it is not advisable that you go outside India at this time. So many matters are pending and how to get our books and BTG printed in Hindi also. I understand that sometimes you are going to Delhi with Tamala in a plane for visiting some officers but that is of no use.

So my request to you now is that yourself and Tamala Krishna go to Delhi to organize a center there and make arrangements for printing our books and magazine in Hindi and recruit life members there also.

I understand that you have been invited by Syama Dasi in Africa. I don't advise that you associate with her because she is __sahajiya.__ To associate with her will hamper pure devotional service. Besides that you are going there for only one month after taking so much labor. What will be the profit? Will they contribute money for our Mayapur project? Unless our Mayapur project is finalized, I don't think any one of you can go outside of India. My advise is that Tamala and yourself immediately make arrangements for going to Delhi and organize that center nicely.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
