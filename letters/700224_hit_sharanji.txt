====== Hit Sharanji ======

Scindia House\\
New Delhi

My dear Hit Sharanji,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to remind herewith of my letter dated February 2, 1970, in which everything was clearly described. In your letter dated January 24, you informed me that two pairs of Murtis were to be received by the 5th of February, but I have not heard anything whether any one of the pairs has already been dispatched.

Along with my reply I forwarded a copy of the letter to Srimati Sumati Morarji, and I do not know what is the result. Anyway, if you have not received any reply from Scindia Navigation, there is no need of waiting.

So kindly enlighten me what is the situation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
