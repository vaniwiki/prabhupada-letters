====== Amarendra ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Amarendra Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4.17.73. You are asking me to advise what should be your program, but now I wanting to leave these matters in the hands of my disciples. I have created GBC specifically for this purpose. If you the elder disciples cannot manage things, then what is the future of the society? My business now is to sit down and write my books, and I am requesting you all to please cooperate with me in this endeavor. So I think you can take advice from Rupanuga Maharaja, as he is my authorized agent. So I am sending him your letter and a copy of this letter in this regard.

Both you and your wife are nice Krishna conscious devotees. You have all good talents to use in Krishna's service. My request is that you simply remember Krishna always and I will pray for your ever increasing advancement in Krishna consciousness.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
