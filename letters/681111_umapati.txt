====== Umapati ======

My dear Umapati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Nov. 1, 1968, and with pleasure I have noted the contents. When you were in Montreal I told you that you continue to work at present and give me $400.00 per month for my literary propaganda work. I require so much money for purchasing a printing press as well as paying the bill of Dai Nippon. So do not quit your job, but try to earn some money for feeding our missionary activities.

Regarding your proposal to open a center in Paris, it is very very nice idea. But for the present until we have opened two centers, one in Hamburg and one in London, I think it will be premature to think of opening a branch in Paris. So you can accumulate some money for this idea, or keep the money with me as I have already proposed, and as soon as there will be opportunity I shall ask you to go to Paris and open a center there.

It takes a little time to understand the philosophy of Krishna Consciousness but I am glad that now you are prepared to do anything for Krishna's sake, this is a great causeless mercy of Krishna upon you. Please continue your present attitude of serving Krishna and His cause, and certainly you will be successful in the matter of Krishna Consciousness even in this life. You know that your intimate friend, Hayagriva, is devoting his whole energy and money now. Similarly other students they are also doing that and the more we do so, it is better for us. Exactly if we supply nice nutritious foodstuff to the stomach, it is better for all the senses. Similarly, to serve Krishna more nicely is better for our own interests. Krishna is not in need of our service but if we sacrifice everything for Krishna, that is for our good. You should always remember this maxim.

Hope you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
