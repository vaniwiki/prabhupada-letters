My dear Sriman O.P. Goelji,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 1st, 1975. Please excuse me for my late reply, as I was very very busy in Vrindavan for the opening ceremony of our Krishna Balarama Temple. As I was scheduled to come to Bombay after the ceremony, I thought I shall call you at my Bombay residence, (Hare Krishna Land, Juhu, Bombay) and talk with you in detail. But circumstantially, I stayed in Bombay for a few hours only because from Vrndavana, I went to Delhi, then to Kuruksetra as I was invited by Sri G.L. Nanda in a big meeting, and again I came back to Delhi, then to Bombay and on the same night, to Perth, Australia, where I am now staying.

Your proposal for co-operation with ISKCON is welcome. I very much appreciate your proposal. The mass problem at the present moment in India is actually a food problem. I have therefore decided to start some village organization program---namely, people should be invited to live in the village, produce their own foodstuff (grains, fruits, and vegetables), maintain a sufficient number of cows to get a large quantity of milk, produce their own cloth, eat sumptuously for keeping fit in health, and then they can regularly sit down and chant the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra. I shall arrange for the irrigation of the land and the people living there should give their labor for their own food and clothing, and then chant Hare Krishna Maha-mantra and cultivate Krishna Consciousness. Besides that, our men should go from village to village with Sankirtana party, hold festival, namely distribution of Bhagavat prasadam and induce them chant and join with us in vibrating the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra. In India, they are not less than 95% villagers and Mahatma Gandhi wanted this village organization. I think this is a solid program. The people must eat sumptuously---not voraciously and make them fit for working and chanting. In this way, they will be purified and everything will be nicely organized. We require some men only like your good self to co-operate with this movement. The necessary things in this connection will surely be supplied by Krishna. Simply we want some sincere worker like your honor. Up to date, I am working chiefly with my foreign assistants and disciples. In India, for them there is the language difficulty, otherwise they are ready to work in Indian villages also. Besides that, they have visa problems. Under the circumstances, I require immediately some willing, educated worker for this purpose. So, kindly reply this letter to my Honolulu center. The address is as follow: 51 Coelho Way, Honolulu Hawaii, USA.

By the by, I be to request you to see His Excellency, Sri Aliyavar Jung, the governor of Maharashtra in connection with our temple construction, the sanction for which is pending in his hand. The Governor of U.P., Dr. Channa Reddy, approached him on my behalf on December 18th, 1974, the copy of the letter is enclosed herein. The Governor of Maharashtra acknowledges

which is giving me too much anxiety. I have established about 100 big big temples all over the world. Unfortunately, I am getting too much anxiety in my country and I do not know why. If you kindly solve this problem, it will be a great relief for me and a great service to Krishna.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
