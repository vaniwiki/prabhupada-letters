====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

New York

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 7, 1968, and I thank you very much for your encouraging news of the Sankirtana party. Please confer my blessings upon your very good wife, Himavati, and I am so pleased that she can sew nicely, and make the costumes for the Sankirtana party. It is very wonderful that you have secured already some engagements for our party, and it is indication that it will be great success. It has just begun, and already there are so many engagements. I am so glad that you have organized the Sankirtana party, and it is very satisfactorily progressing. And at present, I am counting upon you more than anything else, because my program is, after going to New York for some days, then I shall go to Boston, to Buffalo, and to Montreal, and I shall take the Sankirtana party with me, and make an experiment how we get response. I shall then proceed with Sankirtana party to England, then to Holland, to Germany, and to any other countries, and/or directly to Bombay. One of my Bombay friends has written me as following: "I am pleased to receive your letter dated 3rd March, 1968, and have noted the contents. We are already doing Kirtana on Sundays and that is a part of our curriculum. This can be made extensive by your team of followers from America arriving in India. The best place for continuous Sankirtana is Vrndavana. __Please let me know when you would come to India, with the devotees, so that we may arrange a reception and have a suitable program.__ Yours sincerely, Hari Krsna dasa Aggarwal." So, if we can reach Bombay with our Sankirtana party, and as promised by my friend, some Indians join us, then we shall make an extensive tour of India with the party, and we shall invite all kinds of religionists to join us. The Indian government is particularly secular government, and if we can present unified form of Krishna Consciousness---one God, Krishna; one scripture, Bhagavad-gita; one mantra, Hare Krishna; and one work, His service, then certainly we shall get very good encouragement from Indians also. My future contemplation is to have tours all over the world for 6 months, and sit down in a nice place for the balance 6 months, for training boys and girls as well as editing our publications. You consult with Brahmananda and he may consult with Mr. Kallman how this program may be given real shape. But I think this program will be solid one for propagating our Krishna Consciousness all over the world. And in spite of New York City's so many faults, I have got a natural inclination to make my headquarters in N.Y.C. Most probably I am going to get my permanent visa, from your government, and in that case, I want a very nice place to stay in N.Y., and make it my permanent headquarters for editorial office, as well as training Sankirtana party and preachers.

So far the advertising is concerned, you can follow the example of the enclosed advertisement, which is very nice. I hope you are both well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
