====== Jayapataka ======

Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1/9/74 and have noted the contents. By the grace of Lord Nrsimhadeva I am improving in my health.

Regarding the citizenship, you should apply as many as possible. You can read, write, and speak Bengali. So take citizenship. The local officers are in favor, so they will grant.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
