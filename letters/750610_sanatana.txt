My dear Sanatana dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. No, you should not bother with all this nonsense. Astrology will not save you at the time of death. My Guru Maharaja was a great astrologer and astronomer, but he gave it all up. It is meant for the karmis. We have no interest in such things.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
