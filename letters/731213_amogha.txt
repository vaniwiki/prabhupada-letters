My dear Amogha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated November 30, 1973. Thank you for understanding this Krsna Consciousness philosophy more and more. Now that you have a little taste, kindly keep it as the most valuable asset of life.

Take care of the devotees under your charge by maintaining our standards and always setting the proper example. Krsna will certainly give you all guidance. Please offer my grateful blessings to all the devotees there.

Go on with our devotional practices and preach this Krsna Consciousness very boldly and enthusiastically to whomever you meet.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
