My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated July 12, 1968 with the notes of your successful performances of city Kirtana movement and it is a very good plan. I think we should not be worried about our expenditure, Krishna has given us good opportunity of service, and if we simply execute the service, by such performances of Kirtana and practice ourselves the rules and regulations rigidly and with faith in Krishna and service to the orders of the bona fide Spiritual Master, then there will be no scarcity of our necessities of life, and very pleasantly we will be able to execute our Krishna conscious activities without any anxiety for financial difficulties.

Actually everything belongs to Krishna, and if He likes, He can immediately give us the whole U.S.A., but He is very cautious because we are prone to the allurement of maya, so He does not give us all of a sudden all the facilities, lest we may fall prey to the illusory presentations of maya. Just like a physician does not give delicacies to a suffering patient, but as he recovers from the disease, the physician allows him to accept palatable dishes. So we have to wait for the cure of our material diseases, and proportionately as we become recovered from the disease, the supplies of pleasant things will automatically come. But we must always know that there is nothing more pleasant than Hare Krishna. When we will be able to relish the transcendental pleasure, in chanting Hare Krishna, that will be the sign of our recovery from material diseases. Please continue the method in cooperation, very faithfully and diligently, and Krishna will help you more and more.

Hope you all are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
