====== Kirtanananda ======

My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21st July, 1973. I have noted the contents with great pleasure.

Yes! Go on acquiring the surrounding lands and in this way we will establish a local self governing village and show all the world a practical example of spiritual life as Krishna Himself exhibited in Vrindaban. Agriculture and protecting the cow, this is the main business of the residents of Vrindaban, and above all simply loving Krishna. The cows, the trees, the cowherd men and Gopis, their chief engagement was loving Krishna, and in New Vrindaban we want to create this atmosphere and thereby show the whole world how practical and sublime our movement is.

I shall go to New Vrindaban as soon as your palace is finished. Jaya!

For the small cottages I suggest to construct as the diagram below---wooden beams and between the beams fill with gravel cement. The roof may be tile. The size may be 12' x 15'. This design is especially suitable for grhasthas, who can feel very comfortable there, and you may house four brahmacaris in such place. Every day you can build one such house, ten may be required, and in one month you will have 30 such nice shelters.

Regarding Janmastami. Why not continue your festival up to the end of the month as I have suggested. I will be finished here 22nd August. So on 23rd I can start for New Vrindaban.

Why do you say "little sannyasi", you are Maharaja---Great King. Like Yudhisthira Maharaja and Pariksit Maharaja---Emperor. Actually you are doing something very, very big---so you are Maharaja. Krishna will bless you. Therefore you are Kirtanananda, one who take pleasure in Kirtana.

I hope you are well.
