====== Yamuna ======

My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 17 February, 1970, and have read the contents with great interest. We are not impersonalists, under the circumstances we have got varieties of perception in the matter of discharging devotional service. In Rupa Goswami's "Siksamrta" it is stated that advanced life in Krsna Consciousness means one should be always very much anxious to calculate whether every moment of his life has not been utilized in devotional service. This is called feeling of being afraid for misusing time.

One should be very careful to estimate how every moment of his life is being utilized in the service of the Lord. The Goswamis were very much advanced in this line of action, and therefore about them it is said "__nidra hara bihara vijito__" that means one who has conquered over eating, sleeping, and mating. The idea is to save more time from this materialistic business and utilize it for Krsna's service. When our anxieties are how to utilize life in that way, that stage is abyarthya kalatvam "utilizing life without spoiling it." The next stage is __namagane sada ruci__ "attraction for chanting the Holy Name always" and __priti tad basati sthale__ "feeling of pleasure in living in the Temple or in the place of pilgrimage." So I am very glad that you are gradually coming to that stage; continue it carefully. Try to realize it yourself and teach the method to all your younger brothers and sisters.

Krsna Consciousness means full cooperation with Krsna, and Krsna means with all His entourage. We should always remember this. Just like when we speak of a tree, it includes the root, the trunk, the branches, the leaves, the flowers---everything. Therefore to love Krsna means to love Him along with all His Name, His fame, His qualities, His entourage, His abode, His devotees, etc.

Now I have sent you one copy of all celebrations in the current year of Caitanya Era 484. I hope you have received it through Syamasundara by this time. It will be published in calendar form, but I have sent you one copy in advance.

You must all find time to write some articles for publishing in "Back to Godhead." That is culture. Regarding the devotees, I am very very pleased to learn of their sincere and enthusiastic endeavors in Krsna Consciousness, this is most encouraging to me. Now guide them carefully so that they may be engaged further in our program of Krsna Consciousness movement activities. So far management is concerned, you have to do it amongst yourselves because it is not always possible for me to give direction from such distant place.

Regarding an assistant Pujari, Ilavati may be trained to assist you, but she may not conduct __Arcana__ without being __dvija.__ The system is that only one who is qualified with Gayatri initiation may directly worship the Deities (i.e. bathing, offering bhoga and aratrik, cooking for the Deities, etc.). But she may assist you by helping in all other respects. If for some reason you are unable to perform aratrik, there are other devotees, initiated brahmanas, who can make the offerings there.

Please offer my blessings to all the new devotees and all the other boys and girls at London Temple. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
