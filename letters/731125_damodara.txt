====== Damodara ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Damodara Das Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings.

I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 31, 1973, and I have acknowledge its contents carefully. I have also received the new copy in which you have enclosed; it is very nice.

I am always very much encouraged when senior devotees like yourself and Rupanuga Maharaja are tending to their Lordships. This gives me assurity that our high standard will continue. Thank you very much for this, I am sure that Krishna will give you all intelligence in how you can improve your service to Krishna.

Regarding the second initiation of Antardyana Dasi you may hold a fire yajna and play the Gayatri mantra tape for her to hear through the right ear.

Thank you very much for your kind words regarding my books. Yes, more and more persons as they are exposed to my Krishna Conscious literatures are appreciating their value, and your greatest manner of showing your appreciation is by your constant increase in distributing them everywhere.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
