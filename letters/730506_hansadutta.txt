====== Hansadutta ======

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 2, 1973.

I am very glad to hear how our festival program is going on so nicely in Germany. These festivals will be successful all over the world. As GBC member it is your duty to carefully make a broad program for implementing Krsna Consciousness in every sphere of life, in this way we will become respected as the most important members of human society.

Regarding the special preface for German __Bhagavad-Gita,__ yes I will do that.

You have got the right idea when you say that, "I am always very anxious to know if I am pleasing you or not." Lord Caitanya set the example when he said that "I don't have any love for Krsna. If I had any love for Krsna, I would have died long ago from the separation." So one should always think of himself as unqualified.

That you have opened one branch in Stockholm, Sweden is very good to hear. Please continue to send men out in the interior, village to village and town to town.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
