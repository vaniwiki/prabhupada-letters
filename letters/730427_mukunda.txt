====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

Kelso, Washington

My dear Mukunda Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am very pleased to receive your letter dated 4.26.73 and the steps which you have taken is worthy of one who is my disciple. So please revive your old Krishna conscious activities and make your life successful. Do not spoil your life for a woman. According to Vedic culture one must give up association of woman which is known as renunciation or sannyasa. For Krishna's sake Lord Caitanya gave up the association of his wife, although she was never against Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. According to Canakya Pandita one who has no mother and the wife is not obedient, such a home is as good as living in the desert.

So you immediately go to London and help in organizing the great temple which we have already purchased. It is understood by telephone conversation that George has already paid the full amount for the new house and Syamasundara is going to take possession of the house by May 1. When it is actually in our possession, it can be made into a great attraction especially for the tourists. Practically Syamasundara, yourself, and Gurudasa started the London yatra together with your wives. Now Gurudasa is in charge of Vrindaban construction, so you and Syamasundara can take charge of the London affairs.

I shall be going to New Vrindaban by June 1 and if in the meantime the London temple is taken possession of then I can go there by that time. Anyway I am very pleased by your noble action. Now you do the needful and be happy in Krishna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
