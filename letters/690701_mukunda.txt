====== Mukunda ======

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter to Dinesh, dated 26th June, 1969, and I am little bit disturbed in my mind. This recording business is not our line, so you should not divert your attention for the time being for such things. After a great struggle, you have got now a nice place for the London temple, and if you leave now, your other co-workers, Godbrothers and Godsisters, will be discouraged. So I request you not to leave London at the present moment at any cost. I have already sent you a note for the Archibishop of Canterbury as per your letter of June 19th, and you have so many things to do now. So I request you not to divert your attention to this musical side. I know you are a musician, and naturally you have got a tendency for musical entertainment, but at the present moment our main business is to push the Sankirtana Movement. So, as you are doing, take the Sankirtana Party to various places, and this will be the most appreciated. If you adulterate our Sankirtana Movement with some business motive, then it will be spoiled immediately. Be careful in that way.

Dinesh wanted to print some records, so we have given him two, three recordings. Let him do business in his own way. Why he should drag our men for doing his own business? So I repeatedly request you not to divert your attention to this matter at the present moment.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I don't think Dinesh is doing nice so far Govinda record; practically he has not paid me any money out of this enterprise although he has made a legal document signed by me with very great hope. I don't mind for this let him have something out of it.
