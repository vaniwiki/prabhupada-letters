====== My dear daughters, ======

My dear daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Jagadisha I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. I have chanted your beads and they have been sent by separate post. I have given you spiritual names as follows:

Patricia Bebelman%%------------%%Pasupati dasi

Valerie Cormier%%----------------%%Varuni dasi

Pamela McFarlane%%------------%%Praharana dasi

Now please continue to follow strictly the regulative principles, and observe especially rigidly the four principle restrictions, and without fail always chant at least sixteen rounds on your beads daily, and be happy.

If you follow these principles with determination, you will be freed from all attachment to __māyā__, by Krishna’s grace. The example is that when the sun is in the sky, then where is the question of darkness? Similarly, when the Hare Krishna __mantra__ is vibrating on your tongue, and you are hearing attentively, then your consciousness becomes pure, or Krishna consciousness, and there is no question of __māyā__, or hazy consciousness. Just as when the darkness and the light come together, the darkness cannot stand before the light, so __māyā__ cannot remain in the presence of Krishna. Always remember therefore to chant Hare Krishna, and that will save you in all circumstances without any doubt.

Hoping this meets you all in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
