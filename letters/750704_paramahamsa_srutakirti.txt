====== Paramahamsa, Srutakirti ======

My dear Paramahamsa Swami and Srutakirti das:

Please accept my blessings. Now we have a plan for expanding our Sankirtana and we will be needing so many hundreds of mrdangas. So you have got the fiberglass shells there, so I am informing Jayapataka Swami to arrange for one or two Bengali craftsmen to come and stay with you for at least one year to make the skins. Then our men can learn from him. We will pay the transportation and some salary.

Please let me know what you think of this idea.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
