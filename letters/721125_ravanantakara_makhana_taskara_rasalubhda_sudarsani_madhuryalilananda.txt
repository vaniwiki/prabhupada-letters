My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Kurusrestha I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciples. I have chanted on your beads and they are enclosed herewith. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Rick Knickerbocker/RAVANANTAKARA DAS B.\\
Martin Framson/MAKHANA TASKARA DAS B.\\
Lynn MacDonald/RASALUBHDA DASI\\
Cynthia Greene/SUDARSANI DASI\\
Elizabeth Hanks/MADHURYALILANANDA DASI

Now please continue to follow strictly the regulative principles and rigidly observe the four principle restrictions and without fail always chant at least 16 rounds on your beads daily and be happy.

If you stick to these principles with determination, you will be freed from all attachment to maya, by Krishna's grace. The example is that when the sun is in the sky, then where is the question of darkness? Similarly, when Hare Krishna mantra is vibrating on your tongue, and you are hearing attentively, then your consciousness becomes clear or Krishna Consciousness, and there is no question of maya or hazy consciousness. Just as when the darkness and the light come together, the darkness cannot stand before the light, so maya cannot remain in the presence of Krishna. Always remember therefore to chant Hare Krishna and that will save you in all circumstances, without any doubt.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
