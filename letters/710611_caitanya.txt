====== Caitanya ======

My dear Caitanya Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of your good husband Kanupriya Prabhu, I have gladly accepted you as my duly initiated disciple. I have given you the spiritual name Caitanya Devi Dasi. Please find your beads, enclosed herewith and duly changed on by me.

I am so pleased to hear how you, husband and wife, are doing so nicely in Trinidad. I can see that the response to your preaching work has been very good. You will be glad to know that I have told Kanupriya that if they are willing to make a donation of that house and land, then I'm prepared to go there with Deity and make the installation.

So you should see to it that the trinidad center becomes a grand success. So you must give your good husband all assistance so that he can do things nicely. that is you duty. As his wife, you are his better half and it is your duty to help him in every way possible. So first of all you must keep yourself fit in Krishna Consciousness. the means are simple. Strictly follow the regulative principles, regularly chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, and without fail; read all our books and discuss them with your husband; go out for preaching regularly. In this way always keep engaged in Krishna's service with enthusiasm and faith in Krishna, and He will give you all facility for developing Trinidad center very nicely.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
