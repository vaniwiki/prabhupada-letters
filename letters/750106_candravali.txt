====== Letter to: Candravali ======

Miami

My dear Candravali devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 25th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Your husband will be consulting with Gurukrpa Swami as to what his next engagement shall be.

Your son's name can be Virat das.

Wherever you are, you should always be sure to chant at least 16 good rounds daily and to read my books very carefully, as well as following all the rules and regulations strictly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
