====== Prabhas Babu ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Prabhas Babu;

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, F-54/286, dated July 22, 1969. I have noted that you are going to send the mrdangas more carefully. Yes, I am advising to retire your bill of shipping charges for Rs. 101.50 as soon as we receive instruction from the bank. Yes the books may be gunny packed in cases, and try to charge as low as possible. I understand The Punjab National Bank from Vrindaban has already issued a letter to you so there is no need of sending the document to them. You send the documents directly to New York.

Most probably I shall be going to German and England very soon, and I shall send you some big orders from there. Also I have advised my Seattle branch to send you an order soon, so you will please do the needful in this connection. In the meantime, whatever pending goods are there may be dispatched without delay. I think there are some pending orders sent from New York.

Sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
