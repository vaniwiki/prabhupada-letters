<card class="letter">
My dear Palika,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 4th April, 1971. Please excuse this late reply. Due to my touring program, I have only just recently received your letter.

Yes, very soon I am going to New York. Presently I am in Bombay. From here I shall be going to London and possibly to Moscow also. After that I shall be going on to N.Y. without a doubt.

I am very glad to learn that you are organizing your press work more cooperatively. That gives me so much pleasure. When I go there I shall give you so much work that it will be an over-burden, so that you will be so much engaged. All my senior disciples are requesting me to revive my translating work and I would like to do so for the remaining days of my life. So you have to help me to get Srimad-Bhagavatam and the other translating work done as quickly as possible.

I have not received your handkerchief as of yet. Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
