My dear Hansadutta Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 20, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

You were there in Kuruksetra when Mr. Gupta, the Chief Minister verbally agreed to grant us land and support. You should personally negotiate with Mr. Gupta as Caitya Guru is not so important to deal with him. I wrote one letter to Gopala Krishna dated May 20, 1976, wherein I mentioned that we must have the land all in one piece, not some on this side of the canal, and some on the other side. If the government gives us 30 acres (which was proposed to me by Gopala Krishna) in one piece, then we can attempt. If the land next to the Bengali temple is too small, we are not particularly anxious to construct next to the Bengali temple. But we must have the land in one piece sufficient for our purposes. Also, I will require a sketch of the available land, giving length and breadth. But you should personally do the transaction with the Chief Minister, don't depend on Caitya Guru.

Caitya Guru can remain on in Chandigarh for now. Was the house there given to us or simply given for our use? In any case, you should guide him as he requires guidance and vigilance. I know that Lokanatha Swami is very nice. I am glad to know that he is doing nicely. So far your program is concerned, do not worry that Gargamuni Maharaja's party is doing more books and collecting more money. Both of you are doing very nicely.

In Solan, if possible take the offer by the Babaji. Land in that part of the country is very nice, with nice climate also. Yes, it will be a good idea if he can give over the asrama to us.

How will you keep the buses in India? Please let me know. As sannyasi, you are competent to spend the rest of your life travelling and preaching. Continue in this way with determination. I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
