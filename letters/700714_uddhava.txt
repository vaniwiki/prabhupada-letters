====== Letter to: Uddhava ======

Boston

My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12th July, 1970, along with the blueprint for the third chapter of Srimad-Bhagavatam Second Canto, entitled "Pure Devotional Service: the Change in Heart."

I have looked over the blueprint and noted a few points to be corrected, so I am sending back the blueprint to you for seeing the necessary changes as they are in the text.

I have also corrected the points sent by Pradyumna and the sheet is also sent back herewith.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
