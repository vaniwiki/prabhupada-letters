====== Letter to: Sri P. L. Khanna ======

Sri P.L. Khanna\\
Calcutta

Dear Sri Khanna ji,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th January, 1976, and I have noted the contents. Regarding the person in question, I have no such news so far. Be assured, my devotees in foreign countries do not admit unauthorized persons without first getting my permission.

Thank you for your concern. I hope this meets you well.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
