====== Rupanuga ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 12, 1969, and I am so glad to note the report of your very nice activities. The fact that 72 regular students are attending your class plus visitors means it is a great success. May Krishna bless you more and more for your sincere service. I am sure that your little son, Eric, will come out a great preacher of this Krishna Consciousness movement because he is trained by an expert father and mother, and this will not go in vain. If you can contribute this one son to Krishna for preaching His Glories, you will be doing the greatest service to your family, to your country, and to the people in general.

Regarding your desire to take me there for some time, it is long overdue, and if the climate is suitable, I can go now even, if you think it is necessary. For installation of the Deities, it is better to do this when I go there. Besides that, the Deity is too small for temple installation. But anyway, Krishna and Radha have come to you, and we should welcome Them and let working on the altar go on. I am glad to learn that Bhurijana is preparing to leave for North Carolina tomorrow. It is a very good attempt. I want to open hundreds of centers for preaching this Krishna Consciousness, and one who helps me in this endeavor is certainly very dear to Krishna and all of the acaryas. You have nicely written "All Glories to Lord Caitanyas Merciful Sankirtana Invasion of Europe", and you will be pleased to know that there is a newspaper article in a San Francisco paper which has the heading "Krishna Chant Startles London". So I hope that this Krishna chanting will startle the whole Western Hemisphere.

Please offer my blessings to everyone at your temple. Hoping this will meet you in the very best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
