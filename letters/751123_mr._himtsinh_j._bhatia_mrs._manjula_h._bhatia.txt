Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bhatia,

Please accept my blessings. I have understood from Sripada Nava Yogendra Swami that you have taken keen interest in our Krsna Consciousness Movement. So I am very pleased to hear this and I thank you for your service in helping to push on this mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Our mission is that especially those who have taken their birth in India that it is their responsibility to become perfect in the science of Krsna Consciousness and to deliver everyone in the world. In this way everyone is expected to become guru. But how to be a guru? It is said that one simply has to repeat the instructions that Krsna has given. If he repeats without adding or subtracting anything, then he is qualified as guru. Actually there is only one guru---Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So those who simply repeat His words, they also become guru. But of course a guru never thinks himself as being God. He only thinks himself as the servant of the servant of the servant: __gopi bhrtya pada-kamalayo das dasanudasa__ [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|(Cc. Madhya 13.80)]].

Recently I visited Africa and I could see that the management was not going on properly. So now I have given Nava Yogendra sannyasa order and am sending him back to Africa. He will be the president of the Mombassa temple, so please help him to make our mission there very solid.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
