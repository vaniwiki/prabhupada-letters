====== Letter to: Sudama ======

My dear Sudama,

Please accept by blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your latter dated May 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very glad to hear that there is an increase in classes and that the mantra class is being held daily twice. In this way if we always concentrate on reading our literature then there will be no difficulty to preach. Nor will the mind wander to other subjects. By reading these books regularly we become more and more convinced in Krishna Consciousness. And if we become more convinced, that will spread the potency of Lord Caitanya's sankirtana movement with great strength.

I have received one letter from the boy Satyadeva and I think he is doing very nicely there as president. I think it is a good idea for you to start your center in the city of Tokyo and also to keep the asrama where I was staying. The Indians there in Tokyo will help you. You can first of all solicit their help in this matter by first making them life members, just as we have done in London. I am also glad to hear that Trivikrama has become enthusiastic for helping you in this way.
