====== Letter to: Bhakta dasa ======

San Diego

My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 14, 1973, and I have noted the contents with pleasure.

It is very pleasing to me that you have distributed so many of my books and preached to the students. This is our mission of life, to somehow turn the minds of the conditioned souls to Krsna consciousness and thus give them the highest perfection of life. So you are a very sincere soul and Krsna will give you intelligence how to do this more and more.

As far as your questions on management, you may please consult with Karandhara, who is my GBC man for the Western Zone, and work out some practical program for seeing that temple management and outside preaching work both go on nicely, not that I shall leave the temple and let all nonsense go on, nor shall we sit down all day in the temple and stop our preaching. Please continue in your sincere attitude and Krsna shall bless you more and more along with the others who are assisting. Always consult with your GBC man and manage things very nicely.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
