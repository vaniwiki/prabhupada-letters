Mayapur

My dear Pancaratna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26th inst. and have noted the contents. I have not received the Bengali Bhagavata Darsana yet. We want first class printing---offset method is cheaper and good. You may use Srila Bhaktivinode Thakura's translation of the Siksastakam. Also, Bhakti-Katha is alright for the title of compilation of my articles from the Gaudiya Math magazine. Sri Isopanisad is being translated by one of my friends here, and as soon as it is ready we can send you a copy. Regarding help, you may negotiate for Jayasacinandana to come from Los Angeles center.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
