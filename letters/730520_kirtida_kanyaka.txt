====== Letter to: Kirtida Kanyaka ======

Los Angeles

My dear Kirtida Kanyaka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your short note and $15. Thank you very much.

My request is that you please take this Krsna Consciousness Movement very seriously. It is a great opportunity to become free once and for all from the clutches of Maya. Maya is very strong, but by taking shelter of Krsna, Maya cannot reach us.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
