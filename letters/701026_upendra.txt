====== Upendra ======

Suva, Fiji

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter from Fiji Islands dated October 4th, 1970, and noted the contents. I am very glad that you are preaching steadily our Krishna Conscious philosophy and this should be done in defiance of all the atheistic propagandas which are so much current.

Regarding the impersonalist swamis, don't try to mix with any Swami who has no knowledge of Krsna Consciousness. So their speaking is simply maya, therefore they are called Mayavadis. Lord Caitanya has warned us that anyone who listens to or tries to understand the impersonalist philosophy is doomed, his devotion will become dried up.

Regarding worship of demigods, the whole Hindu society is absorbed in this business, so unless our preaching work is very vigorous it is very difficult to stop them.

As soon as I return to Bombay I shall send you the tape as you desire. I shall be returning to Bombay by the 31st October. So far the literatures in Hindi, Gugrati and Tamil are concerned, it shall take some time because we have no ready made such literatures. But we are getting Hindi "Back to Godhead" very soon as Tamala has informed me.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
