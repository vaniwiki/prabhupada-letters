====== Letter to: Sharma ======

Nairobi

My dear Sharma,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. So, why did you leave Mayapur if you are so expert in chanting? Read my books and do some menial service, but why you have left Mayapur? You are restless, so what can be done. You were chanting in Mayapur. Wherever you may live, you have to abide by the order of the authority. Because you are restless you are not fit for chanting absolutely.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
