My dear Mr. Sauvageau,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 17, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am very pleased to know that you have taken such a great interest in our Hare Krishna Movement. You are an educated man and you can use your education very nicely in the service of Krishna. I like the idea of yours to continue on for PHD presenting our books and philosophy in your thesis. This will be a great service for you to perform and I shall be very grateful to you if you can do it. Please therefore go ahead with obtaining PHD and become a learned scholar in the science of loving Krishna.* This will be a wonderful credit for you and you will surely get recognition from Krishna for such an attempt.

Keep in touch with Jagadisa dasa and he can give you all assistance.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
