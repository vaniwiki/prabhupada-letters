====== Karandhara ======

Tokyo

Dear Karandhara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 12, 1972 and have noted the contents carefully.

I am answering your letter from an air ship going to Nairobi, Kenya. Where I will speak from Jan. 26 - Jan 30 to the Africans and Asians alike.

I do not know how and why these transparencies were sent to India but Tamala Krishna Das has received your cable and is doing the needful.

Your proposal to move Tokyo Temple back to the center of Tokyo is very good. This was my Guru Maharaja's policy that we should remain in the big cities in order that the maximum amount of people could take advantage of our preaching.

In all printing matter I am completely in agreement with you, therefore you can determine when and if ISKCON press can do BTGs.

The reports of increased book sales all over the world gives me so much pleasure. I thank you very much for your very determined efforts to push on this movement of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
