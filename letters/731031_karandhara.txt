====== Karandhara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara Das:

Please accept my blessings. With regard to my letter dated 23/10/73, you may postpone sending Nitai Das here, because my program for Africa and Australia is not yet fixed up. So I may be returning to Los Angeles sooner, so it will not be necessary to go to the expense of sending him here. He can meet me in Los Angeles. Anyway, I will inform you of my program as it is fixed.

Tomorrow I start for Delhi. The new address there is ISKCON, G 12 Anand Niketan Extension, New Delhi 110023.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
