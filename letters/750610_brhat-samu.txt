My dear Brhat-samu dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6-7-75 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the pecans. I shall be coming to L.A. on the 20th of June for one week and then I shall go to Denver for one week. You can see me in L.A., if you like. Please continue to follow all of the rules and regulations carefully, and chant or read always.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
