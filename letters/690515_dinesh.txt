====== Letter to: Dinesh ======

My dear Dinesh,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 11, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. Regarding your idea of pressing a 10" record, if you can sell these in ordinary stores, that's all right, but don't depend simply on temple sales. Depending on temple sales is not businesslike. You must plan your work in a businessman's way, so you cannot depend upon our centers for all sales. In the temple there are devotees, there are not businessmen, so you cannot depend on them for doing business; neither can you expect advice about business dealings from me. I have given you a department to manage nicely, and if there is some profit, you may give some for my book fund, but I cannot be consulted for advice in how you should manage the particulars of your business.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Krishna Devi, and to your daughter, Visnuarati. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
