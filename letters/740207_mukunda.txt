Bhaktivedanta Manor

Dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 23, 1974.

I am glad to hear that you are now concentrating on improving the regulative life of the temple rather than so much advertising with brochures. This is very nice; this is what I want. A good example is better than precept. The pamphlet is precept, but if we don't follow the precepts ourselves then such advertisement is not good.

That Pusta Krsna Maharaja is assisting you in raising the standard at Bhaktivedanta Manor is also good news. He has written me that he is needing English boys to join him in South Africa as the English of all nations have free entry there. He is very hopeful of preaching and distributing books in Capetown. So if possible, help him by offering some English boys, and after some time he may go to South Africa with the boys.

I am already trying from here for my entry visa to the British Isles. Next time I come I shall enter with entry visa.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
