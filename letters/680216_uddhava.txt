====== Uddhava ======

My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter, and have noted the contents. I have already sent copy of the instructions for celebrating my Guru Maharaja's Advent Day, to Syamasundara, as of yesterday, and you can read it to all the devotees at Istagosthi. Similarly, Malati has just recently asked about the 8 witnesses, and I have replied in her letter the question you may ask of Rayarama. I have written Upendra recently regarding the Sampradaya, and disciplic succession, and you may have gotten the information from him by now.

After killing the demon Hiranyakasipu, the Lord Nrsimhadeva was pacified by Prahlada Maharaja, who offered prayers in hymns which are very instructive. I shall be preparing these for you in my Srimad-Bhagavatam. I will simply cite one nice verse: "Oh Benevolent Lord! Friend of the fallen! Oh the Tender-Hearted! Bound by my own Karma I have been thrown into the midst of these demons who are destroying every thing of Your devotees! I am therefore extremely averse to the unbearable and terrible miseries of this cycle of birth and death in this world devoid of service and devotion to You. Oh Lord! When will You be pleased with me and call me to the shelter of Your Lotus Feet which are soothing like the smiling beams of ten million autumnal moons?"

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
