My dear Govinda Dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 17, 1973 and I thank you for so promptly sending the dried banana. You are always seeing to my comforts and your service in this regard is much appreciated by me. I also thank you for the nice shirts you have made. I am especially pleased to learn that Gaurasundara is opening two centers in Brazil. That is good work.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
