My dear Deben,

My last letter was addressed to you about 10 days before but I have received no reply from you. I asked you in that letter to help me in getting some supporters (supperters) of my paper “Back To Godhead”. So I am anxious to know about it. If you cannot help there is no harm. It was a suggestion only. But why you are silent. Please be in touch with me by correspondence. I hope you will reply this p.c. as early as possible. Don’t be silent. Hope you are well.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
