====== Letter to: Nandakisora, Jahnava ======

Detroit

My dear Nandakisora and Jahnava,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your very thoughtful letters dated 21st April and 6th March, 1971 respectively. They were so much pleasing to me. I have just now received them, so there must have been some delay in the mail. Anyway, your kindly sentiments are very much appreciated. You are such a nice couple. I am always remembering how nicely you are preaching and helping me to fulfill the order of my Guru Maharaja. Thank you very much. May Krishna bless you both.

I have received your gifts also and they are so very nice. Especially the bookmarks are such wonderful craftsmanship. The Deities jewelry is also very nice, and I can always use new sacred thread.

Presently I am in Calcutta where we have just completed a huge "Hare Krishna Festival" in which 35,000 people gathered daily to hear discourses on Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita to see arati ceremony and to take prasadam also. Such festivals are proving very successful, and so we are thinking of extending such programs. From here I shall be going to London via Bombay, or perhaps I may be going to Moscow if visas can be secured. From there certainly I shall be returning to U.S.A. and will be glad to see you both at that time.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
