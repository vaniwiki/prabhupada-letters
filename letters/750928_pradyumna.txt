====== Pradyumna ======

Mayapur

My dear Pradyumna das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 11, 1975 and have noted the contents. It is nice that you have started the Sri Rupanuga Vidyapitha Library and that you are teaching the boys at the Gurukula Sanskrit. You can do it. You have got the capacity. Now do it. You may send me a copy of the examination and what were the results.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
