====== Letter to: Ranadhir ======

My dear Ranadhir das,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your long letter of Nov. 15, and I have noted the contents with great care. Yes, I have duly chanted on your beads, and they are sent herewith, and your spiritual name is now Sriman Ranadhir das Brahmachary. Ranadhir is name of Krishna, meaning One Who is very sober, very undisturbed and cool-headed in executing fighting, warfare. You can see from Bhagavad Gita how Krishna is very undisturbed in the midst of the fighting, simply giving instructions do this or do that, but not affected by the clamor of the warfare.

I understand from your said letter that you are recovering from drug addiction, and you are weak and sick somewhat. So long you are feeling weakness, you simply chant Hare Krishna more and more, and gradually you will get strength. So far as your marriage is concerned, first consideration is that the girl must also be very seriously interested in Krishna Consciousness, and must promise to help you and cooperate with you, then you can think of marriage. Marriage is not so important a thing, the important thing is executing Krishna Consciousness. If later on she becomes initiated in Krishna Consciousness, and seriously engaged, then you can consider it. But for now, best thing is you save your money, $100.00 per month, deposited in a bank. Don’t waste it, and I shall advise you duly in this matter. Immediately I think there is no need of a storefront in Columbus, but later on we may consider. *

No, you should never live with non-devotees. That is the first precaution. You should not have illicit sex life and you should not live with non-devotees. By following these 2 principles, you make immediately a great stride in Krishna Consciousness.

Yes, you can study Sanskrit conjointly with Pradyumna if you want; we require a few students to learn Sanskrit. And for now, remain there at New Vrindaban, and regain your health fully, and chant Hare Krishna as you are doing, and shall instruct you further in the future.

I hope you are feeling better day by day,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Consult with Hayagriva in this matter & do the needful.
