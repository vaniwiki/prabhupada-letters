My dear Mathura Prasad,

Please accept my greetings. I have heard from Gopinatha Mahesawari that you came here to see me, but that due to the Governor's coming there was some confusion and you were not able to see me. I am extremely sorry for this. I wish to invite you to come and take lunch with me on the 26th of April at about 11:00 AM if it is convenient for you. I will be awaiting your arrival.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
