====== Daniel ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Daniel,

Please accept my blessings. I am so much thankful to you for your good wishes, and your realization that you are the eternal servant of Krishna. It is the primary understanding of our constitutional position. Actually, we are servant, but in the conditioned state, every one of us posing as the master. The sooner we forget that we are not master, we are servant; and if even though we are not inclined to serve Krishna, we have to become the servant of our senses. So the sooner we realize this fact, that our constitutional position is servant, that means we are liberated. Liberation means to be situated in one's original position. Just like a man suffering from fever, so relief from fever means to be situated in normal condition. So service is our normal condition, but this service being misplaced, we are not happy but as soon as the service is placed to the right person, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, everything becomes happy and successful.

Please go on chanting "Govinda Jaya Jaya, Govinda Jaya Jaya, Radha Ramana Hari, Govinda Jaya Jaya", along with "Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama, Rama, Hare Hare." And in any condition you shall be happy without any doubt. Thanking you once more for your postcard, and I beg to remain

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
