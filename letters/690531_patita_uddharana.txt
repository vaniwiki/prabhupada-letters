====== Letter to: Patita Uddharana ======

My dear Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter post-dated May 27, 1969, and I have noted the contents with pleasure. I am pleased to note that through your influence your family is gradually taking to this sublime process of Krishna Consciousness. This is the proof of how the presence of one devotee will have an uplifting effect upon all of the people he comes in contact with, whether family members or acquaintances. I am very pleased also to note your appreciation for our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ and I want that all of my students will understand this book very nicely. This will be a great asset to our preaching activities.

I am sending along with Candanacarya some old editions of our __Back To Godhead Magazine__ for you to bind. I wish to have bound each year's editions of BTG. Thus, there should be one book with all the 1966 issues, one book with the 1967 issues, and one book with the 1968 issues. If possible, please have these books sent along with Brahmananda when he comes here to see me in New Vrindaban. I understand that you have bound two of my __Srimad-Bhagavatam's,__ but there is no necessity of sending them here immediately. When I need them I will call for them.

Please convey my blessings to the other devotees there with you. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
