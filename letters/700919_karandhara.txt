====== Letter to: Karandhara ======

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated Sept. 13, 1970, and I congratulate you on the good news of opening the Portland center so successfully, and I am very pleased that things are going on nicely. I received your telegram, and also receipts for three deposits to the BBT at Dai Nippon; and I received your other letters, but on account of Devananda's disposition, I have not been able to reply them. Today I am taking the help of Kirtanananda. Please go on sending the reports.

On the whole I am very pleased with your management. The Ekadasi program is very nice. Krishna is giving you good sense and intelligence. Take care of your godbrothers and godsisters very carefully.

Regarding Deity worship, Silavati and Yamuna Devi may be considered expert, so if some new hands come and take their help, that is a good proposition. Once established, however, Deities should not be removed. We should treat the Deities as the Personality of Godhead, and to invite Him to come to your home you must worship regularly. You cannot remove. If there is scarcity of pujaris, then Deities should not be installed, only pictures of Guru and Gauranga should be worshiped. Irregularity in worshiping Guru and Gauranga can be tolerated, as they are always kind and forgiving, but irregularity in worshiping Lord Jagannatha and Sri Sri Radha Krishna is not good.

It is very good news that library distribution is going on nicely, and I am very much pleased that Dayananda is helping you. I know he is a very sincere devotee.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
