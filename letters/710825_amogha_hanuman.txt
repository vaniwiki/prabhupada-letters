====== Amogha, Hanuman ======

My dear Amogha and Hanuman,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated 20th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear now nicely your travelling and preaching program is going on so you continue with it as far as possible in that area. This touring program will create an atmosphere of Krishna Consciousness everywhere, so go on. And introduce these classes wherever possible. The response is so good. I am also glad to note that you have received $1000.00 for magazines. If you want you can keep it for your touring program expenses but if possible you can send it to Karandhara in L.A. or to me for Dai Nippon. We just paid them $20,000. for back BTG debts and we still owe them $27,000. more. So if you can send it for that purpose it will be nice unless you require it for your travelling expenses.

Yes, even the Buddhists will come forward gradually and inquire into this Krishna Consciousness. Everyone is sophisticated by their so called religion but chanting Hare Krishna Mantra will attract everyone all over the world.

The temple plan enclosed is approved by me, but we must have full control over the temple, otherwise we are not going to take charge. We cannot make any compromise on this point. Unless we have full charge we are not interested. It must be a branch of our ISKCON and run by us. We cannot take responsibility if others are controlling the temple, otherwise we are not going to take charge. That is not possible. We have got our own principles and they must be followed as they are in all our branches all over the world. We cannot make any change in Kuala Lumpur.

You can tell Kamala Devi that in the first week of October I will be in Madras because we are arranging to hold a Hare Krishna festival there in a pandal at least for ten days and maybe we will open one center there. From Madras I shall go to Calcutta.

Upon your recommendation I have gladly accepted Neo Che Wee as my duly initiated disciple and his letter and beads are enclosed herewith.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
