====== Syamasundara ======

New York

My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 25, 1974 and I have carefully noted the extensive contents.

You have taken the right decision. For the time being you suspend your GBC responsibilities and let Hansadutta manage as he is doing nicely. Hansadutta saw me recently, however, and was complaining that he is meeting with an opposing party there, although he is working as authorized GBC. I think if you ask all of them to cooperate with him while you stry to improve your business separately that will pacify things. I am hopeful and praying to Krsna that you become successful.

The difficulty is you didn't know about the business and you believed everyone. I have a report even from Bal Krsna that you have been cheated. If you have sufficient experience and are careful then you can do the business. I think it requires great experience, otherwise you will be cheated.

For the time being do your business and wherever you stay follow the regulative principles. Always chant and follow the regulative principles. Then you can see me in India during the installation ceremony in Vrindaban. I shall advise you further. There are so many things which happened in your absence which I do not wish to discuss now. But everything can be rectified if you follow my instructions. If you have actually sold jewels that is encouraging and we can discuss further about it when we meet next.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
