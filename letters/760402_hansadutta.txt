====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

Mayapur

My dear Hansadutta Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated March 29 and March 30, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. Concerning your need for some competent Hindi speaking devotees to assist the village program, I am authorizing that Lokanatha Swami can go with the buses. Also, I am aware of the shortage of manpower at Mayapur and I am sanctioning Bhavananda Maharaja to do the needful and also for some men to go from here, but whether they actually are being sent?

If it is not possible for you to come to Vrindaban immediately, that is alright. You can manage conjointly with Gopala Krishna by correspondence. So far Himavati's engagement is concerned, she is organizing the nursery here in Vrindaban for the young children. There is a meeting with one minister of Haryana and if it is favorable we may be given some land in Kuruksetra area. It may then be necessary for me to attend one large function there in late April if we are given the land, anyway, however, nothing is fixed up yet. Otherwise, if my presence in Kuruksetra is not needed, I will be flying to Bombay the morning of April 12, and then leaving for Australia, Fiji, and Hawaii about the 18th of April.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
