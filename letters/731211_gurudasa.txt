My dear Guru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 3, 1973. You report that although construction has temporarily stopped the expenditure is still Rs. 100 per day. I do not think four masons require so much. Please explain what is the Rs. 100 per day expenditure.

Tamala Krsna Goswami has reported that he recently sent you Rs. 25,000 for our Vrindaban project. We are presently making arrangements for a special transfer of funds to India through the U.S.A. State Department. So if possible carry on with the Rs. 25,000 until that can be completed.

There is no need for you to come to the U.S.A. Stay there and work on.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have written two letters one to Dr. Kapoor and the other Hari Goswami for starting an adult school for learning Hindi & Sanskrit. Please see them in this connection. We want this school in Vrindaban.
