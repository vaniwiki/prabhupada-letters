Dear Sri Mody:

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due receipt of a copy of your letter addressed to Sriman Madhavananda das dated November 1, 1974. I did not know anything about this incident. I am very sorry for it however, and I am inquiring into the matter further.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
