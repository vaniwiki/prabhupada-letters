====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

Alexandria, Australia

My dear Madhudvisa Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 4th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for settling things up nicely in Fiji. Enclosed, please find one copy of a letter to Vijoya das requesting him to work co-operatively with Asta Siddhi das.

Try to get some nice farm. That will be very good. If we can produce milk products and grain, there will be grand success. I was so much pleased with your book distribution there. I am sure that the coming year will be even better. I am very much encouraged by big book distribution. I have received information from Ramesvara that 50,000 big books will be distributed every month in 1975. Introduce the books as far as possible. That is the success of our mission.

Please send the next shipment of ghee immediately, as it takes quite a while for it to reach India. Shipments should be sent regularly every six months. The amount that you sent last shipment was good, send that much twice a year.

You are so humble and so sincere, this is a sign of your success. May Krishna bless you more and more. Krishna has placed you in that position. Now, you should always be fully conscious of your great responsibility.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
