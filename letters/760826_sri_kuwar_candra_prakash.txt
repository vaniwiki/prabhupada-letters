Dear Sir,

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letter dated 29 July 1976 and have noted the contents with care. Thank you very much for it. Just now I am in New Delhi at the above address and am going to Vrndavana by the 2nd or 3rd of September.

It will be a great pleasure for me to see you personally and if possible we may talk about a program how you may be engaged in the service of Krishna Balarama. You are a very qualified person and can render many valuable services to the Lord.

Please excuse me that my secretary could not write in Hindi, therefore the reply is sent in English. Please accept my good wishes and more when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
