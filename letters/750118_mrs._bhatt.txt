====== Letter to: Mrs. Bhatt ======

Ontario

My dear Mrs. Bhatt,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 29th of October, 1974 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for your kind donation of 2500 Rupees for our food distribution program. It will be very helpful in endeavors.

I hope that by now, you have had the opportunity to come and visit our center in Toronto. You are cordially invited to visit there anytime. The address is: 187 Gerrard St., East, Ontario M5A 2E5. We have very nice Radha-Krishna murtis there and there are many devotees there also. Please visit at your convenience.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
