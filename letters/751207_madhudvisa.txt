My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter with the recommendations for first and second initiation, their names are as follows;

Steve---Visvahetu Das

Dave---Dustamohana Das

Grant---Jitagarisa Das

Rodney---Usapati Das

Peter---Adhipurusa Das

Samjata Das Brahmacari

Lugudi Das Brahmacari

Veno Gopala Das Brahmacari

Krpa Kara Das Brahmacari

Jagatvira Das Brahmacari

Asta Siddhi Das Brahmacari

I have chanted on the sacred threads and they are enclosed herewith, now hold a fire ceremony and have the students hear the Gayatri mantra chanted by me and the tape recording through the right ear. Instruct the newly initiated Brahmins about cleanliness, taking bath three time daily, taking bath each time after passing stool. Cleanliness within and without, that is very important for brahminical life. The qualifications of the Brahmanans are described in the 18th Chapter 42nd verse of the Bhagavad gita. You may chant on the beads of the first initiates, and they must chant at least 16 rounds daily, that will keep them strong.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
