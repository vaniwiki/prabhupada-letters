====== Ramakrishna Bajaj ======

Bombay

My dear Ramakrishna Bajaj,

I have received your letter dated October 21, 1976. In that connection, whatever Giriraja will accept, arrange and I'll do.

One thing has developed now in the Western countries. They are feeling the weight of our movement. Therefore, an attempt is being made to suppress or stop the movement in Europe and America. In America the parents of my disciples are combining together.

On account of the Hare Krsna Movement people in the Western countries are being attracted. There is now counter-propaganda by the enemies. They are now organizing opposition. Will Gita Pratisthan help this Hare Krsna Movement to face the cultural fighting between East and West?

The idea is, that the rapid advancement of the Hare Krsna Movement has threatened the foundation of Western Civilization. One American politician has remarked in this connection, that the Hare Krsna Movement is spreading like an epidemic. If we do not take steps to stop it, it may one day capture the government. This is a good certification for our success, but the time has come now when we have to meet strong opposition. After all this Hare Krsna Movement is Indian culture. If the leaders of Indian culture will take it seriously, then certainly India's glories will be magnified.

In the foreign countries India is much advertised as a poverty stricken country. But, if India can give Her spiritual culture, Krsna consciousness, she will be glorified everywhere. This should be the aim of Gita Pratisthan.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
