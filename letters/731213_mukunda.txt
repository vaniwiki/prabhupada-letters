====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

London

My dear Mukunda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 6, 1973. Regarding the type of paper for India, we want the same type as we have already used for Srimad-Bhagavatam and Krsna Book. Karandhara has advised me that Dai Nippon purchases most of their paper in Sweden so you may check there. The size will depend on the presses used in India so you may contact Tamala Krsna Goswami in Bombay about this.

A letter has just been received here from Syamasundara about selling jewels. I do not approve of our Temples purchasing jewels. I have instructed Karandhara to issue a newsletter to all our Centers to this effect. It is not a good program.

Kindly keep me informed of all developments there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
