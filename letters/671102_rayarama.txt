====== Letter to: Rayarama ======

My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated 24 & 25 Oct. respectively. I may say that in reply to your letter of Oct 24, you may go to England around the first of Dec. or whenever you find it convenient. There is no hurrying the attempt. In the meantime go on improving the condition of BTG which you are doing very nicely with the cooperation of your very respectable God-brothers. Regarding Kirtanananda, I cannot allow him to become Keith again. He is my spiritual son and I shall never allow him to fall down. When I return I shall drag him forcibly and make all right again. Anyone who has once come to me has become my beloved son; temporarily one may display some Mayic affliction, but that can not prolong. I thank Lord Krishna for Satyavrata (Moskowitz) and Woompati and I hope sincerely that Kirtanananda will also come back again with renewed energy. I am glad that Hayagriva has returned the manuscript of Gita and I understand from Brahmananda's letter that they are being made ready by professional typist. From Madhusudana's letter it is understood that MacMillan has agreed for paper back printing. Anyway get it ready and print it immediately anywhere you like without delay. I requested Satyavrata (Moskowitz) to publish __Lord Caitanya's teachings__ which is ready with Satsvarupa. Thakura Bhaktivinode's book Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu may be printed in thousands and distributed. If Isopanisad is also printed it will be very nice. I shall take one copy of Brahma Samhita and I shall try to print it. I have decided to return back with visitors visa as advised by you. Therefore I am returning to Calcutta tomorrow and my next address will be as it is in the return address. You can send by surface mail our latest BTG copies to (copies #14, 15 & onward)
