My dear Ambarish,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very encouraging letter dated 31st May, 1977 and thank you very much for it.

Your name is as Ambarish, worthy, because Ambarish Maharaja was the greatest emperor in his time, and at the same time the greatest devotee. Even by being challenged by a great yogi, Durvasa Muni, he came out triumphant. Durvasa Muni was such a great yogi that he could travel all over the material and spiritual worlds within a year and he could go personally to see Lord Visnu for protection of his life. But Lord Visnu was unable to save him because he was an offender at the feet of Maharaja Ambarish. So this is the history of Emperor Ambarish. He was so kind and benevolent a devotee and thus all success of life was due to him. I am very glad that you are following the footsteps of Maharaja Ambarish. Your life is sure to be successful and triumphant in the devotional service of the Lord.

Many thanks for your encouraging letter. I am improving and hope to see you all again in due course of time. My habit is not to remain stationary. I want to move still, but my physical condition does not allow me at present. Please pray to Krsna.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
