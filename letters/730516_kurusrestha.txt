====== Letter to: Kurusrestha ======

Denver

My dear Kurusrestha,

Please accept my blessings.

Upon your recommendation I am happy to accept the devotees you have mentioned, Dattatreya das and Rama Tulasi dasi, for second initiation. Now hold a fire yajna for devotees only. Afterwards, in private, play into the right ear, of the initiates, the tape of me reciting gayatri mantra. Teach them how to count on the finger divisions.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
