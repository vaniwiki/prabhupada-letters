My dear Gurukrpa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 30, 1974 with enclosed Credit Note No. 125 from Dai Nippon for Dollars 39,474.73. I am very glad to receive it, and I thank you very much. My blessings are there for you in your collecting program. After all you are already Gurukrpa.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
