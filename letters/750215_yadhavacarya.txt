====== Letter to: Yadhavacarya ======

San Pedro, California

My dear Yadhavacarya das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 6th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I think in connection with film making, you should contact Yadubara das adhikari in Los Angeles temple. He can help you and give you advice as to how is the best way to work in this way. He is experienced in this field.

I understand from your letter that you are now in prison. Anyway, you can use such a situation as an opportunity for preaching Krishna Consciousness. I am very glad to hear that you have already distributed some books in prison. Please try to keep yourself fixed in Krishna Consciousness by chanting 16 rounds daily and following the four regulative principles strictly and reading my books very carefully. These things will keep you nicely in Krishna Consciousness so that wherever you are you will remain strongly fixed in the service of the Lord.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
