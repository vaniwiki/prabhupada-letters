====== Letter to: Gaura Govinda ======

Bhuvaneśvara

My dear Gaura Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2/1/77 and have noted the contents carefully.

We shall arrange for one man to oversee the construction. That will be supplied. You have got all blessings of Krsna. You are so nice faithful servant of Krsna, surely you will be successful.

Come to the Kumbha Mela where I am going on the 11th instant and we shall talk in detail. Then with you I shall return to Bhuvaneśvara and start immediately the work. You can stay with us for four or five days at Kumbha Mela, then we shall go with you. Arrange for that. You can book one first class compartment for four of us from Allahabad to Bhuvaneśvara for the 17th or 18th.

Before coming to Allahabad you can go to see one professor. His name is Dr. Banshidhar Mohanty. He is in the department of Oriya at Utkal University in Bhuvaneśvara. He has got one manuscript of Srimad-Bhagavatam that he wants to show me. You can see him and see also this manuscript. You can inform him of my coming there and ask him to come to see me at that time. When you come to Allahabad you can inform me about the manuscript.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
