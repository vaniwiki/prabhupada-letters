====== Jayapataka ======

Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th July, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to learn that you are again president of our Calcutta center. In the beginning also I did not want the change. Anyway, let there be no change anymore.

So far account keeping is concerned, are you taking assistance of a professional accountant? At the end of one year you will have to make a balance sheet and trial balance. That takes good experience. Tamala is going to audit the accounts by somebody else, but how can they be audited in the absence of trial balance? So if you have actually made a trial balance and balance sheet please send me a copy before it is audited. On the whole our account should be kept very nicely because we are dealing with the public's money.

In Calcutta there is no International Society Book fund a/c. So all book fund money may be directly transferred by mail to Gowalia Tank Road Branch of Central Bank of India to account number 14876. Central Bank will dispatch free of charges. Gowalia Branch has already issued a letter in this connection that all mail transfer will be free of charges.

Regarding exporting of mrdangas, I am very glad that you are in charge of this department. It is so nice that you are taking care of temple affairs and exporting of instruments, beads, etc.

I am very glad to know that Yasodanandana has arrived there from Berkeley. I shall be glad to know how he is engaged in Calcutta activities.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
