====== Hayagriva ======

New Vrindaban

Dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. Since a long time I did not hear from you, but I am very anxious to see you.

Here in Bombay we have a nice spot. We are now in possession. It is just like a garden house. I shall be glad if you come here and live with me for some time. With my love for your wife and children, I beg to remain,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
