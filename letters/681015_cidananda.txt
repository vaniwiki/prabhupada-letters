====== Cidananda ======

My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 11, 1968, and I have noted the contents carefully. I also thank you for sending my passport along with the two certificates which I have duly received yesterday and I am utilizing it for my medical examination, and other activities in connection with my permanent visa in USA. It is so much encouraging that your Sankirtana party is going everyday collecting some money and encouraging also that you are selling Back To Godhead. Similarly the Sankirtana party here also led by Tamala Krishna is doing very nicely. I understand that the son of Tulasi devi, Karnapura, has chosen coins in his Annaprashan ceremony. It is very nice. I think this boy will earn enough money for spreading Krishna Consciousness.

Hope this will meet you in good health, I am

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
