My dear Sevananda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 9, 1976, with the enclosed 3 copies of the Chinese edition of the Bhagavad-gita As It Is. It is a great triumph, and now you should see that this work continues. It is very important, and Krsna will bless you all for your sincere determination.

Regarding the two initiations, on your recommendation I agree to accept Yasomatisuta das for second initiation. Enclosed you will find his brahmana thread, and a copy of the gayatri mantra. After the fire sacrifice, you should play a tape of the gayatri mantra into his right ear, teaching him how to count on the fingers the prescribed number of times. The brahmana should remain clean outside and inside by regular bathing and chanting of the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Also, I agree to accept Bhakta Richard as my disciple. A disciple promises to refraim from the four pillars of sinful life: no illicit sex-life, no intoxication, no gambling, and no meat-eating. In addition, one must chant at least 16 rounds of japa daily and in this way progress in Krsna Consciousness. One promises before the spiritual master, the Deity, the fire, the devotees, the Supersoul, so it should very strictly be followed. You can have Gurukrpa Maharaja chant on his beads before the Fire Sacrifice, and present his beads to him at the time of the sacrifice. His spiritual name is Satyasena das. See that everyone is strictly following by presenting an ideal example yourself, and try to distribute these new Chinese Bhagavad-gita as much as you can.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
