====== Gopala Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
Bombay

My dear Gopala Krishna das:

Please accept my blessings. I have read your letter addressed to Pancadravida Swami dated July 23, 1975. So a temple may not be wanted there now. But, someone must stay there and print literature. Keep Guru Gauranga altar. But there is no good preacher. Even Pancadravida fails. Trivikrama failed. You should simply print literature and distribute. Get the smallest rental place. Let Yasomatisuta do it. Give up the present flat if necessary.

Bhurijana wanted to go there, but if he is spiritually weak, then there is no need. Print literature and distribute, or if it is impossible, then close it. Yasomatisuta should be assisted by somebody. He is a good boy. Therefore I do not like to close it.

Why you have not mentioned anything about Bombay?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
