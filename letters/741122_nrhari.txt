====== Nrhari ======

My dear Nrhari Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated September 27th, 1974 from San Diego. I have also received the photograph of your new son Mahaprabhu Das and he appears to be very nice so keep him carefully and raise him in Krishna Consciousness and your life will be successful. I am forwarding your letter to Hrdayananda Swami. The contents of your letter are very complicated and I hope that he can settle this matter peacefully. It appears that you do not have to pay back these debts, anyway you should all work this out amongst yourselves.

Although there may be some difficulties within our Society, these things are not very important. What is important is that we should simply fix our mind on Krishna's Lotus Feet. This is His instruction in the Bhagavad-gita. So we associate with one-another so that we can assist each other in hearing and chanting about Krishna. That is the purpose of our Society. This you will not find in the materialistic society where all hearing and chanting is simply concerned with sense gratification. So our desire is Krishna and we want to go back home---Back to Godhead where Krishna lives eternally. So you simply follow my instructions as I have given to you and surely your life will be a success.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I understand that you are translating "Bhagavad-gita As it Is". Please continue this work and Krishna will bless you. I want to see that my literature is widely distributed. In Spanish language there is great scope for distributing our literature and preaching to the people of South America\\
