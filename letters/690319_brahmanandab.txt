====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated March 15, 1969, with enclosures. Regarding L.A. consignment:* It has nothing to do with your business. I have already advised them to send their bill separately and the payment also will be made separately. It has nothing to do with your transaction. You just complete your transaction with them about balance money due from them. This is the idea.

The application which you have sent for filling up appears to be little puzzling for me. So far I understand from the statement, I shall have to stay there in N.Y. but I do not know whether I shall be able to stay for such long time as 7 or 15 weeks.

Therefore, I think the best thing will be if you take up this class---that will be nice---because you are residing there.

Regarding MacMillan Company, if they have not replied your letter, then forget. We shall publish our own books. You organize the sales promotion. Neither I want to shorten the Srimad-Bhagavatam. We should not count on them---let us try for our own publications.

I have received the dust cover of Teachings of Lord Caitanya, but I think the paper is not as polished, as shiny, as the first one was.

Hoping you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*through the United Shipping Corporation.

If Dai Nippon is not very definite about printing my books neither it is possible for being published by MacMillan Co., then the next alternative is to start our own Press. And you organize the sales.

Enclosed one letter for %%__%% Please hand it over to her. By the end of the month I shall go to S.F. & by the 7th of next month I shall go to N.Y.
