====== Letter to: Jadurani ======

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far as black and white photographs of paintings, I don't like that idea. How expensive they are doesn't matter but colored photographs should be there only.

The picture of Sadbhuja, 6-handed Lord Caitanya, anyone can paint, it doesn't matter, but it must be done very nicely.

Bhisma was lying on the bed of arrows on one side of the battlefield. There was trees and grass, but no dead men were around. Only there was the Pandavas. Krishna and great sages such as Vyasa---big, big men. Krishna was in the forefront in His royal dress. Bhisma was a stout and strong old man. The arrows were piercing his body only. They did not go all the way through. The arrows piercing his back were supporting his body and there were many arrows piercing his chest. There were no arrows in his head. A sunset scene is all right.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
