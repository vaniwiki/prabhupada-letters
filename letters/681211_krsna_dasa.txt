====== Krsna dasa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very nice letter dated November 5, 1968 and I thank you very much for the kind sentiments that you have expressed therein. Because you are very nice, sincere boy so Krishna is now giving you very good facilities by which you can serve Him and at the same time perfect yourself for going back to Godhead. So if you try to continue in the humble attitude you have now, with little time you will have wonderful success in further developing your Krishna Consciousness. Actually the Krishna Consciousness is already there, but it is now covered up so we must wipe away the dirt of maya from our consciousness so the pure essence of consciousness, or love for Krishna, may once again shine forth. I am always praying to Krishna to help you more and more so if you remember to always increase your efforts to make progress in spreading this movement, then Krishna will certainly save you, rest assured.

I have noted with much pleasure that you are planning to mimeograph our essays in the German language. This is good news and please do it nicely. These literatures must be made available to all peoples so they may take interest in Krishna and seek to learn more. This will attract many people to begin chanting and learning this philosophy. So try in this way, it is very important endeavor. In the United States we have now published Bhagavad-gita As It Is and by next month we should receive the Teachings of Lord Caitanya. So if you can also present our literatures in the German language it will be very successful.

You will be glad to learn that we are having very good success in improving our temples here because Los Angeles has acquired an excellent, large chapel suitable for living quarters and kirtana and New York has also acquired a grand three story building for a five year lease and this building is being described to us as being a palace. So with our new books this is all very encouraging and I am always thankful to all of my students for their sincere endeavors in this mission.

So please convey my blessings to Uttama Sloka and Sivananda. I have not heard from Uttama Sloka so if he will have time, please ask him to write. I hope this letter finds all of you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
