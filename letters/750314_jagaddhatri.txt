My dear Jagaddhatri devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 4, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your kind sentiments. From your letter I can understand that you are advancing very nicely in Krishna Consciousness. Yes, you are right---all qualifications come if you simply surrender to a bona fide Guru. Please follow all of our rules very careful and your life will be perfect.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
