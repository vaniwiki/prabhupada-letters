My dear Dr. Mohan Singh,

It was a great pleasure to meet you this evening. You are a devotee of Krishna and a learned scholar. Meditation is meant for yogis, it is said in the Vedic literature, __Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah__ [SB 12.13.1] a yogi is one who always meditates on the Lotus Feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who meditates on Krishna is the topmost yogi of all. We have explained this fact in our book "Topmost Yoga." I request you to read this book and meditate on Krishna, then you and your followers will be first class yogis performing the best meditation. __Yoginam api sarvesam mad-gatenantaratmana__ [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]].

I thank you once again for coming here. If possible you may come to Vrindaban. I invite you to stay with me for some time so we can discuss more on this subject matter. I am returning to Vrindaban by 20th October.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
