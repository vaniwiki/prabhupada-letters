Dear Mr. Nyamiaka,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 18, 1975, delivered to me by my disciple Jnana das Adhikari. I had requested Jnana das for you to come and see me in Nairobi and he said you were to come, but unfortunately I did not meet you. Anyway I am glad that you are appreciating this Krsna consciousness movement which is meant for the welfare of all living entities in the universe. Our philosophy is that there cannot be happiness or peace unless everyone serves the Supreme Lord. Just like the body cannot be nourished unless food is supplied to the stomach. When the food is supplied to the stomach, then the entire body becomes nourished very nicely. But if I foolishly think let me put the food not in the mouth hole but in the ear hole or the eye hole, then that is simply foolishness and there will be no good result. So at the present moment, we are thinking let us serve this "ism" or that "ism" or so on, but actually we should serve God and then everything will be taken care of. This is not some sectarian faith but it is eternal truth.

I am glad that you are reading __Bhagavad-gita.__ Try to do this regularly. Chapter 2 is very important because it explains that we are not this body, that we are spirit soul, part and parcel of God. One has to have this preliminary understanding if he is to advance in spiritual life.

We want very much to spread this highest welfare activity there amongst the Kenyan people and we are very thankful for your cooperation. Please try to give us more and more facility. We want the people to live simply but to think highly. We want to make projects whereby the people produce their own food, food for themselves and also for the animals. In this way they can produce their own necessities and not live on any artificial standard. My disciple Jnana das Adhikari is there for this purpose of establishing our program. The main thing is to chant Hare Krsna and take the remnants of foodstuffs that have been offered to the Lord. This is our main program and please encourage him for this program within the village people. Everyone will like to sing and dance and to eat nice foodstuffs. This is our simple process for God realization. I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
