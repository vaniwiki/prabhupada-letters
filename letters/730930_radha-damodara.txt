====== Radha-Damodara ======

My dear Radha Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for the very nice button you have sent me. Preaching work is our main business as this picture on the button shows. I pray that Krsna blesses you with all strength and intelligence to guide the Sankirtana movement ahead in Denver.

I hope this finds you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
