Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Vijoyadhvaja das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 30, 1974 and have noted the contents. What is the difficulty if Subala das Goswami comes there. Sudama Vipra Maharaja is already engaged in the Philippines. I have no objection to Sudama Vipra going there, but he is already engaged. Better you continue there and let Subala come and organize in Fiji and get men from Australia.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
