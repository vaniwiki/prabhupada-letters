====== Letter to: Areya ======

Spanga, Sweden

My dear Areya Devi Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated October 13rd, 1974 in which you request to become married. You can consult this matter with Hansadutta who is my representative. He is Grhastha and he can advise you in this matter. Please go on regularly chanting your rounds and pushing on Krishna Consciousness philosophy to everyone you meet. This will help you remain fixed in devotional service.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
