====== Krsnakanti ======

My dear Krsnakanti,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated 7th and 21st February, 1971 respectively and have noted the contents carefully. You ask that you become strong enough to fearlessly preach Krishna Consciousness. Yes, I know that you have got Krishna's blessings. Therefore you are strong enough to go on preaching and as you do so your strength will increase more and more. I am very pleased with your service from the very beginning. Please go on in this way and push on the cause of our mission.

Yes, Krishna is providing everything. Krishna is so kind. As you require something for His service, he provides it. And Tulasi Devi is growing so nicely there. Tend Tulasi very nicely and your devotion towards Krishna will increase. In the evening a lamp should be offered to the Tulasi plant and in the morning each devotee should offer a little water and offer obeisances.

Push on your program at schools and colleges, vigorously, as you have been doing, and try to teach classes there also. That affords the ideal opportunity for introducing our books. Try and get KRSNA book and Bhagavad-gita AS IT IS recommended by the professors. Door to door Sankirtana is very nice program also, and a very nice means for distributing the books, so increase it more and more. And incense business is also picking up. These are all different opportunities to render service to the Lord. From now on all BTG and book fund collections should be remitted to Karandhara in L.A.

Yes, when I return to L.A., I shall be glad to visit Seattle. Radha Krishna Deities may be installed at that time also, provided there are at least four doubly initiated devotees present who can take proper care of them.

Jambavati should try to avoid any more marriage. Once she has been forlorn by her husband and who knows that a second husband might do the same? Let her forget her marriage and be fixed up in the service of the Lord. Simply she should concentrate her mind on the Lotus Feet of Krishna and she will be happy.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
