====== Devananda ======

My dear Devananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am so pleased to learn that you are lecturing in the Boston University class in mysticism, and they are appreciating your versions. Please always remain submissive in spirit to Krishna and Spiritual Master, and by their Grace you will get all strength to speak and satisfy your audience. I remember when you were walking with me on the New York street, you were proposing me to become lecturer in some University. And your honest desire has been fulfilled by Krishna, that He has given sufficient strength unto you, that instead of me, you are speaking there as my representative. This is all Krishna's Grace. But one thing I may inform you, that the three books which I have already prepared, namely, the Bhagavad-gita As It Is, Teachings of Lord Caitanya, and Srimad-Bhagavatam, all these books are the ultimate source of knowledge. If you simply reproduce what I have tried to explain in those books, surely you will come out victorious, even in the midst of so many great mundane scholars. The description given in these books, are not mundane speculations, but they are authorized versions of liberated souls, presented by our humble self. So the strength is not in us, but the strength is in the Supreme Lord. And we have simply to present them without any adulteration, in humble service spirit. That is the secret of success. Hoping you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
