====== Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have arrived safely in Los Angeles by Krsna's Grace and everything here is going nicely.

Now, as you know, we require some men for India. Karandhara informs me that you have declined to send any. Our programs there are important and there is a great need. We have not captured many first class men there so we must import. I am requesting therefore that you send at least one or two first class men from your zone. Men from Australia do not require visas so they may go directly. Kindly make arrangements for this.

My program is to visit some of our U.S.A. branches for some time, keeping Los Angeles as my home base and then to return to India by Lord Caitanya's Appearance Day.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
