Bombay

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 19/4/72, and I have noted the contents. I think as you have described everything is going nicely in Bombay, and I have no objection if you feel like going to Australia for heading up the Sankirtana party there and managing things in general.

One thing, what happened to that insurance for Rs. 5000/-? So far "Akash Ganga" is concerned, forget about paying them---let them try to get money from the courts. Why there is talk of two months for renting the pandal? We have rented that pandal for one month only, so we shall not pay for more than that.

Karandhara has sent many books there from Japan, so you can encourage them there to sell as many books as possible, and __all__ the money can go towards building, there will be no division of Book Fund/Building Fund for the time being.

You can go to Australia, there you have got enough field for your dancing. Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland are very good field and you will have very good assistance from Mohanananda. In New Zealand we have already got one land of 3 acres. You are now a veteran devotee and very sincere, so you organize everything in Australia and New Zealand. Here, Sudama is taking sannyasa to overhaul the whole of Japan. I see these Japanese as better than the Americans, they offered me their obeisances immediately.

One thing, if you take any kholes to Australia, be sure the heads are of special pre-tanned leather, not rawhide, or they will be not allowed entry. There is only one khole in Australia, so these are very much needed, but how to get them past the customs? Correspond with Mohanananda on this point.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
