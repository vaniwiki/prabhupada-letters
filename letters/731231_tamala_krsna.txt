====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

Bombay

My dear Tamala Krsna Goswami,

Please accept my blessings. I have recently received one letter from Sridhara das Brahmacari who has left Bombay and gone to Vrindaban. He reports he is disappointed having been removed from his job of managing construction in Bombay. Sridhara is a very good boy and a hard worker. While I was there it was fixed up that he should take the responsibility for construction work. Why was he removed? Now Yasomatinandana is coming to join you and he is a qualified engineer. Between he and Sridhara they can, I think, manage construction affairs without your having to put a karmi professional in charge.

We have to manage our men in such a way that they may bend to our will but not break. After all, our work is purely voluntary. If they become angry and leave then our work is defeated. I have directed Sridhara to return to Bombay and work with Giriraja. Please give him some facility so he may work happily. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
