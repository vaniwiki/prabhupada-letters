Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter on November 12, 1971, and I have appreciated the contents with great pleasure. Radha and Krishna have been so much merciful upon me to have given me so many nice spiritual sons and daughters as yourselves. I can see by the photos of your Los Angeles Temple that you are all very good servants of Radha and Krishna, and that They are very much pleased by your service. Thank you very much for assisting me in this way.

Now my one request to you all is that you become fully happy by conducting your lives in Krishna Consciousness, and you can know it for sure that in this way you will come with me back to Home, back to Godhead.

I hope this meets you all in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
