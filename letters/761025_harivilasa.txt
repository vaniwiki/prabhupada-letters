====== Harivilasa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Harivilasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 19/10/76.

Let this couple first of all legally marry. After that we bless them by observing a fire ceremony. It is not necessary to burden me with these matters. Please consult with the local GBC.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
