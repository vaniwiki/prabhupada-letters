====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 6, 1968. Also I have received the duplicate copy of the letter of credit which you have returned.

So far as dealing with Mr. Kallman, I think that you should have no more business dealings with this man. At every turn he tried to cheat us so we must consider him as very dangerous cheater and avoid any future business dealing. We shall continue to be polite with him but this is far as it is to go because his only thought for us is how to exploit. You must remember this in any future contact with him. He now owes me $15,000 for the record album royalty that I recorded and yet he claims that our society owes him so much money for incense and records. This is all a bluff because unless he pays me how can he insist we owe to him. So it is best that we have no more schemes with this Mr. Kallman. Not even should we buy records from him. We shall rather make our own records.

I have seen the recent dummy you have sent of Teachings of Lord Caitanya and it is very much approved by me. I think that all of the devotees should purchase one copy of all of our books for study and future preaching activities.

I have also heard from Purusottama that you have now obtained one beautiful temple on Second Avenue that can very nicely be compared with a palace. So this is all Krishna's Grace. You have tried so hard to find a new temple there but Krishna did not approve so there was no temple. But now that Krishna wills it with simply a flick of the eye a temple has come to us, better even than we were hoping for. So this is what is meant that Krishna is Controller and we are controlled. When we simply remember to accept the control of Krishna and not to act independently then all fortune is automatically present. We have received from Yamuna Devi in London some completed certificates so please send a list of all initiated devotees in New York so we can send out. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
