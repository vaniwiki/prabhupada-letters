====== Gaurachand Goswami ======

<card class="letter">
Dear Gaurachand Goswamiji,

Please accept my dandabats. Enclosed please find one copy of advise to the Punjab National Bank, Kunjhaba-Balarama Temple branch, to pay you Rs 50 (fifty rupees) per month. I shall arrange that you get this money so long as you live. When I was in your temple both you and your wife took very much care for me, so kindly accept this little help. This is apart from my temple contribution; this is for your personal expenditure. Thank you very much.

Yours Sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
