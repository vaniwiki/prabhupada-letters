My dear Raktaka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge I am in due receipt of your letters dated 24th and 31st of December 1969. So, I am very glad that you are determined to go ahead in Krishna Consciousness and, if you remain serious and steady, certainly you will make infallible progress. Of course, Maya is very strong, there is a chance of our falling down at any moment, but if we are able to catch hold of Krishna's lotus feet by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, then Krishna gives us all protection from the onslaught attack by Maya. Remember this principle always and follow the footsteps of Jayapataka, he is very good example, and, even there is some misunderstanding, try to tolerate and don't be agitated. I am very glad to learn that you appreciate the activities of our Boston Temple, and I was also very pleased to see their routine work.

Regarding your marriage, I have all sanction for it, but I do not know what is the legal implication. Besides, that, the girl is not initiated. But if she is working very obediently in the Temple, there is no impediment in your being married with her and she may be initiated later on. I am sending herewith back the beads of Labangalatika duly chanted by me. Please offer my blessings to the twelve inmates who are living in the Temple at present and especially to the newcomers. Please try to convince them to take part in the Sankirtana Party either within or outside the Temple. So, on the whole, you have got my approval for the marriage and you can do the needful.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
