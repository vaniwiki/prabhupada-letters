My dear Citsukhananda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 26th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding your new engagement, you can consult with Gurukrpa Maharaja and decide which engagement will be best for you.

Your new son's name can be Virat das.

Always continue chanting 16 rounds and reading my books, observing all the rules and regulations and you will be strong in Krishna's service.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
