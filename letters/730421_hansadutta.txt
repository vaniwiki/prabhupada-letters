====== Hansadutta ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Hansadutta Das Adhikari:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 7, 1973 and am pleased to accept the following boys and girls as my initiated disciples: Ram Mohan Das (Reiner); Jnanavigraha Das (Joachim); Tirthada Das (Thomas); Hrimati Dasi (Helga); Santimati Dasi (Ulla); Durgama Das (Dario); Premchand Das (Werner); Kamaksi Dasi (Karin); Uktal Das (Ulfert); Atmavidya Das (Axel); Gobhata Das (Gerhart); Ama Das (Amin); Ramgati Das (Ronald);---and Nikhilananda Das (Niko); and Vaidyanath Das (Erland), these two boys I have already informed their names in reply to a letter from the Hamburg temple. Beads may be sent to Revatinandana Swami.

I am also enclosing Gayatri Mantras for the 14 disciples and 10 sacred threads duly chanted upon by me for the men disciples. You show them how to count on the fingers, and let them hear the mantra chanted by me on the tape through the right ear. .

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
