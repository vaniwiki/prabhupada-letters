====== Citsukhananda ======

<card class="letter">
Dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessing. On your recommendation I am accepting the following devotees as my initiated disciples and there Spiritual names are as follows:

__1st Initiation__\\
Wilfredo---Varesa\\
Ricardo---Urdhvabhaga\\
Pedro---Puruji\\
Harry---Tarksya\\
Carlos---Durantavira\\
Steve---Siddhajana\\
Salvador---Gopesa\\
Jorje---Kavi\\
Teo---Krato\\
Solvai---Subhanana Dasi\\
Bula---Tilakaini Dasi\\
Maria---Modani Dasi\\
Anthony Velasquez---Pitamvara\\
Lenox---Vasuki\\

Reinaldo---(now here in Los Angeles) Simhadasa

__2nd Initiation__\\
Viraha dasa\\
Pramona dasa\\
Tamoha dasa\\
Vara devi dasi

I have duly chanted on the threads of the three men recommended by you for Second initiation, Viraha, Pramona, and Tamoha, and you may also distribute gayatri mantra to Vara devi dasi. Play the tape of gayatri mantra in their right ear and instruct them regarding Brahminical principles. For those receiving first initiation impress on them the importance of chanting at least sixteen rounds daily without fail and always observe the regulative principles. You may hold fire yajna for the initiates and instruct them on the ten offenses to chanting.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
