My dear Giridhari,

Please accept my blessings. I bet to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil. I have noted the contents carefully.

I am very glad to hear that you are distributing my books more and more. All over the society they are distributing nicely, to my great satisfaction. You are right when you say that “Krsna Consciousness is not a matter of over endeavoring for Krsna.” Work in Krsna Consciousness must be executed quickly, carefully and with attention to detail. The first principle is that one must himself be steady in Krsna Consciousness.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept those devotees whom you recommended as my initiated disciples. Their new names are: Steve Soholof- Siddhavidya Das; Kirk Hampton- Kirticandra Das. Now hold a fire yajna and send their beads for chanting to Kirtanananda Swami in New Vrindavan.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
