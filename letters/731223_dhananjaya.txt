====== Letter to: Dhananjaya ======

Rome

My dear Dhananjaya,

Please accept my blessings. Karandhara has informed me of the receipt of the letter from you reporting the establishment of an ISKCON Center in Rome, Italy. The transcendental bliss I have derived from hearing the news is not measurable within the three dimensions. I thank you very much for your humble service and I pray to Krsna to always protect and bless you. I will look forward to seeing the first Italian Back to Godhead which I understand you are printing at present. We shall try and locate some Italian speaking devotees to send there to assist you. Kindly offer my blessings to your good wife Bala Gopala dasi.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
