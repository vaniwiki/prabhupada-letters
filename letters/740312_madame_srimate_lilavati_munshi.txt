====== Madame Srimate Lilavati Munshi ======

<card class="letter">
Dear Madame Srimate Lilavati Munshi;

Kindly accept my greetings. When I was in Mayapur I received your invitation letter dated February 26; I received your letter on March 3rd, and was not able to attend, but I thank you very much.

I am returning to Bombay by the end of March. If at that time you are there I shall be very glad to meet you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
