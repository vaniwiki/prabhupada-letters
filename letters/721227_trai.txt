Iskcon Boston

My dear Trai das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated december 7, 1972, and I am so much pleased to hear from you that the book distribution has increased five times than before! Similarly, I have heard from Chicago and other places also that they are increasing five times than before. That is very encouraging to me. You are, I can understand, very much enthusiastic to endeavour big things on Krishna's behalf, and all of the new students there at boston centre are also feeling enthusiasm from your example. That is the business of leader: He must be himself always enthusiastic and inspire others to be always enthusiastic.

Then he is real leader. And that enthusiastic mood is maintained when everyone is always without fail chanting 16 rounds daily, rising early for mangal arati, reading books, preaching---in this way, by observing strictly the regulative principles of devotional life, that enthusiasm or great eagerness to have Krishna will come out. So if you are very serious to remain tightly there in Boston centre and develop it fully, I am very much pleased upon you for this. That is advancement in Krishna consciousness, to stick tightly to the desires or orders of the spiritual master; because my Guru Maharaja ordered it, and I am also ordering it: Go on preaching, spread this Krishna consciousness all over the world, then if you are taking up the responsibility for that, to work very cool-headedly in this way, then you are understanding rightly what is the point of giving our energy without any personal considerations to Krishna. So try to develop Boston temple to be the first-class temple in your country---why your country, in the world.

Recruit some educated men from the colleges, schools in Boston, train them up for preaching mission, in this way develop the quality of your men to be the most surrendered servants of Krishna. That will please Krishna, and you will feel also yourself becoming more and more happy in perfecting your life.

Upon you recommendation I am glad to accept the three new devotees as my duly initiated disciples. Their letter and beads are enclosed herewith.

Hoping this meets you in good health

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
