====== Letter to: Bhavananda, Jayapataka ======

Mayapur

My dear Bhavananda and Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 4, 1973 and I have noted the contents carefully.

From your report it appears that everything is progressing very nicely. What can I say? I am so much indebted to all you nice American boys and girls for helping me to execute the order of my Guru Maharaja, may Krishna bless you.

I hope this letter meets you both well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Please send me regular reports fortnightly. You have not written anything about Sanitary & electricity accomplishment. I guess everything is stopped for want of cement.\\
