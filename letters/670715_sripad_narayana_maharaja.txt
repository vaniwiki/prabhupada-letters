Sri Sri Vaisnava Carana Dandavat Purvikiyam\\
I am offering my dandavat pranaamas to the Vaisnavas lotus feet and then I am writing.

Sripad Narayana Maharaja,\\
If Krsna desires I will reach Delhi or Calcutta next week, so you have no need to spend any money. If Vinoda Kumara gets his passport, he must wait for my letter. Only one disciple will come with me. The cost for one ticket is Rs 50000/- (fifty thousand rupees), so I am now a little bit worried. For now don't spend whatever rupees you have left. Wait for my letter.

Vasamvad\\
(Gratefully),\\
