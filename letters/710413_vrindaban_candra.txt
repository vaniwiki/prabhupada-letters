====== Letter to: Vrindaban Candra ======

Philadelphia

My dear Vrindaban Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18th February, 1971 and have noted the contents. You write to say that this Hare Krishna Movement is perfect in all respects. Thank you very much. And it is a fact that "Sankirtana will keep you happy and the books will keep you convinced", so make your program in that way and become fixed up in Krishna Consciousness.

So you have got some talent for writing and producing dramas and now Krishna has given you the opportunity for dovetailing your talents in His service. Very good. When I go there I shall be very glad to see these dramas enacted. Yes, I acted the part of Advaita Prabhu in one such drama. I organized that theater performance in my youthhood. My friends were trained up and we performed and it was very much appreciated by the highest class of men in Calcutta. We were invited to many places to perform the drama. Lord Caitanya inaugurated these Vaisnava dramas, it is true, but where to obtain such copies of these plays I do not know.* While performing such dramas, always the actors must be Vaisnavas. Outsiders may help but devotees should have all the major roles. So you may perform such plays conveniently. It is a very nice program, but do not sacrifice other programs on account of it.

No, there is no need for worshiping Ganapati, and the facility for such worship is not available in your country. Worshiping Krishna is sufficient.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*I shall try to find out in Calcutta when I go there.
