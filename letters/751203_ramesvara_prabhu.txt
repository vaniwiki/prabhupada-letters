====== Ramesvara Prabhu ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your very encouraging letter dated November 27, 1975.

Your report of book sales is over encouraging. You are all becoming very very dear to my Guru Maharaja. I started this movement by book selling. I was never a beggar for money, but I was writing books and selling. My Guru Maharaja very much liked my writing and he used to show others in my absence "Just see how nicely he has written, how he has appreciated." He encouraged me, and my Godbrothers, they also like my writing. After I wrote that poem for Vyasa Puja of my Guru Maharaja they used to call me Poet.

Anyway, I was working writing books and publishing BTG alone, but I could not give the thing shape, so I decided to go to U.S.A. and now you all nice boys and girls have helped me so much, it is all the mercy of Krishna. Thank you very much.

You can send one full ticket for Gopala Krishna's wife E. Khanna and one ticket (If necessary) for his son 2 1/2 years old D. Khanna to Gopijanavallabha in New York. The money many be taken from Gurukrpa's money. New York, Bombay, Delhi, immediately.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. For the child a half fare will be required.\\
