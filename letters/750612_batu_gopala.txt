My dear Batu Gopala dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 9, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for selling so many books there. This is very much wanted. Try to sell again more and more each day. Regarding naming your Cleveland center, New Govardhana Hill is a very nice name. But as far as worshiping a Govardhana Sila from Govardhana hill, that we shall see later on.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
