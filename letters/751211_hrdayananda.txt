====== Hrdayananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Hrdayananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 25, 1975, I have noted the contents carefully.

The deities in the picture you sent appear nice. Also the article, Visa to the Kingdom of the spirit looks favorable, although I cannot read the language.

Your idea of printing a deluxe edition and an ordinary edition is all right, everyone should get a book that is the idea, so do it.

The idea of GBC changing zones for 2-3 months of the year is also good. Bring up this point at the Mayapur meeting and vote on it.

I accept the below listed students as my initiated disciples their new names are given and you may hold a fire ceremony and chant on their beads. Instruct them to chant 16 rounds daily and refrain from the four sinful habits of material life. The second initiates should hear the Mantra from the tape recording through the right ear, instruct them in habits of cleanliness, and brahminical qualifications and behavior.\\
