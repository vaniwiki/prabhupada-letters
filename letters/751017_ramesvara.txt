My dear Ramesvara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 19, 1975, and I have noted the contents carefully. If Dr. Wolf has become envious then we must simply avoid him. What is his complaint? The idea of the nursery school is very good idea.

I have instructed Pusta Krishna Swami to issue one newsletter to the temple presidents, GBC, and sannyasis concerning the nefarious activities of Swami Bon. Kindly copy this and send out to all the temples accordingly that they should have no dealings with Swami Bon or others who are envious. You will find this letter enclosed.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
