====== Bhakta dasa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bhakta das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your encouraging letter dated the 20th February. Just yesterday I have arrived here in Calcutta, and by the end of the week expect to go to Mayapur where are having a grand celebration on the Appearance Day of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Yes, you have my sanction for installing the new Deities with the cooperation of Karandhara and/or Sudama Maharaja (I think he is there on the West coast). They know how to do it. The more you can decorate the Deities soberly, not fanatically, the more you become decorated with all honors. At the present moment, civilized man has forgotten how to decorate, therefore this mini-skirt---the business of the trees---to remain naked. Human being means to be decorated, like Krsna is decorated, not naked.

You say that you have eight brahmanas, that is very good, now engage all of them so that everyone becomes expert. By nicely worshiping the Deities we can be so pure in condition of health, mind and intelligence. Yes, all blessings of Krsna upon Saranam dasi, for her loyal book distribution. I am very pleased, and you can give both her and Satyaki dasi second initiation. So now you can have ten brahmanas, yes? I have also received your $100.00 daksina and I thank you very much for it.

Regarding Nanda Kumar, try to help him. He is a good boy and he will come out again very nicely. But he must marry that girl, we cannot play with sex-life, that is not our business. If he shows he is faithful for three months, then he again can take care of Radha-Krsna.

Your book distribution, that is very nice. Our books are unique, all this distribution means that they are being appreciated. There is no such literature throughout the whole world.

Now keep yourself pure and Krsna will help you. Krsna has become merciful upon you. I am only the agent. He has special favor upon Americans, so tell your countrymen to take advantage and spread our teaching all over the world. I hope this meets you in good health. Hare Krsna.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
