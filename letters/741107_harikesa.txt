====== Letter to: Harikesa ======

Vrindaban

My dear Harikesa das:

Pleaser accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 31, 1974 and have noted the contents. Thank you for giving me the account of Gurudasa. What is that hotel bill for Rs. 1200/-?

I have already written you one letter of thanks for your taking care of the Vrindaban temple.

I note that you are reducing the expenses, but why did the Treasurer leave? Even if you restricted the spending, then why did he leave?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
