====== Bhavananda ======

Mayapur

My dear Bhavananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one telegram from Gargamuni reading as follows; Ras purnima over five thousand books sold four lakhs visit temple Bhavananda signs twenty thousand autographs awaiting your arrival 15th or after please reply.

This means that by the grace of Krishna, not only our Mayapur Candrodaya Mandir has become very popular all over Bengal, side by side you have also become the attractive feature in Bengal. So, it is Krsna blessing you. Take this opportunity for preaching in Bengal. Especially please go from village to village with a party of 5, 6 men and preach the message of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu with great enthusiasm. Along with preaching simultaneously Gitar Gana will be distributed.

So far my going to Mayapur, I am expecting to go to Hyderabad, therefore I shall fix up my date later on. In the meantime both Gargamuni and yourself preach vigorously.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
