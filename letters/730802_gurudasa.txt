====== Gurudasa ======

Vrindaban

My dear Guru Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 23, July, 1973 and I have noted the contents very carefully.

Yes! why not? You may write to the other temples and ask them to contribute something to the program, that is approved by me. I simply want to see that the work is going on vigorously, and the money shall not be used to pay bad bill. The money should simply be used for construction.

Another thing is that my living quarters may be finished by this coming October, or at least habitable so it may be used if I go to Vrindaban by Kartika Vrata.

What about that front piece of land not yet in our possession?

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have just received your letter of the 28th July, but I have not yet received the photos under separate cover.\\
