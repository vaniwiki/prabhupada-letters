====== Letter to: Bhakta dasa ======

San Francisco

My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 16th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I have been informed by Jayatirtha prabhu that you have decided not to get the farm and that you want to get a building in Berkeley. I have discussed with him and that idea is approved by me.

The boys that you have recommended for 1st initiation are accepted by me. Their names are: Ed---Hrdayagovinda dasa, Nagaraja dasa and Jamie can be called Jiva dasa. Kirtanananda Svami can chant on their beads.

Concerning Ganesa worship, it is not actually necessary for us. But, if someone has a sentiment for getting the blessings of Ganesa in order to get large amounts of money for Krishna's service, then it is alright, but anyone who takes up this kind of worship must send me at least 100,000 dollars monthly---not less. If he cannot send this amount, then he cannot do Ganesa worship.

Please continue distributing by books as many as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Thank you for the 100 dollar check.
