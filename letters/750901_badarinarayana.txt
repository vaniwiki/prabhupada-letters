====== Badarinarayana ======

Ann Arbor

My dear Badrinarayana das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note dated May 9, 1975 attached to the letter by Pam Conger. Upon your recommendation I am accepting her as my initiated disciple, and her spiritual name is Padmahasta dasi. Please see that she chants regularly 16 rounds.

Enclosed please find herewith a copy of a letter to Mr. Mahalingam. You have to deal tactfully in your preaching. Do not compromise the truth, but speak palatably so he does not reject it but accepts it. That is preaching.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
