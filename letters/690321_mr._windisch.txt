====== Mr. Windisch ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Mr. Windisch,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much pleased to receive your letter dated March 18. Your writing in the second paragraph is so much encouraging for me and your appreciation of devotees like Upendra and Ananda is super excellent. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught us this lesson---one who appreciates a sincere devotee is eligible to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am so glad to learn that you are prepared to come to L.A. but in the meantime I have come here to Hawaii. I am returning to San Francisco by the 31st of March, and if you kindly see me on or before the 6th of April, 1969, there in S.F., with Barbara if possible, it will be very good opportunity to talk in detail about your future service. Your suggestion to return to Germany and engage yourself in the translating and publishing work of the books and magazines in German language is very much welcome; because you are a sincere soul and trying to serve Krishna sincerely, He is giving you good intelligence from within.

Hope to see you again and we shall talk more when we meet. Hope you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
