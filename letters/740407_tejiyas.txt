====== Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. This morning Sriman Gurudasa has come here. He says that he did not receive the check for Rs 24,000 which was issued in favor of Rajastani Moorti Kala Kendra. Under the circumstances he has already ordered you to go to the bank and stop payment on check number PHF 431993. Now it has been settled that the murti walla will supply deities at RS 19,005 final payment. But he wants a bank draft.

Under the circumstances I am just issuing another check number PHF 431995 for Rs 19,005 (nineteen thousand and five rupees only) in favor of Punjab National Bank itself. So Gurudasa is returning to Delhi and both of you see in the bank if the former check PHF 431993 is positively stopped for payment. Then sign the present check and take a bank draft for payment in Jaipur and that will settle up the thing. I hope in the meantime you have received the check for Rs 23,000 (twenty three thousand rupees only) for steel, which acknowledge receipt.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enclosure: 1 check for Rs 19005/-
