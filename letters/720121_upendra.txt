====== Upendra ======

St. Kilda, Australia

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 2, 1972, and with pleasure I have noted that you are desiring to be personally present with me again, and I also am looking forward to seeing you all nice boys and girls in Australia again. Yes, you may be my cook when we shall meet at that time. Tomorrow I am flying to Africa for a few days to attend Brahmananda's festival in Nairobi, and I may even stay there for some time if our Mayapur program is cancelled due to government restrictions against foreigners in Nadia district. But I am sure to come there to Australia by springtime.

The Los Angeles temple is our ISKCON standard, so as far as possible you may build in that way. I have had many requests from many students for a list of holidays and festival days. Now we have got Panjika %%___%%, so I shall be compiling such list very soon and I shall send you a copy.

I have received one very nice letter from your good wife, Citralekha, and I hear that she has now joined you there, so I may thank her here for serving me so nicely in India. She has learned a lot about deity worship I think, so she may train up the others there in Australia centers.

I hope this will meet you both in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
