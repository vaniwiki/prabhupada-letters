My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far the Vakil Little Gibbs House is concerned, the offer mentioned by you is all right, but one point is that Mr. Vakil must take the responsibility of vacating the tenants on the first floor. We cannot become involved in such transaction. So he must see to it that they are moved out. So you can discuss it with him and make the following offer: We will pay 10-1/2 lakhs under the table. Then we pay 1-1/2 lakhs down and 3 lakhs in installments over three years time. So included in the 10-1/2 lakhs is 3 lakhs compensation for vacating the first floor tenants and he can pay them off immediately. The point is that we must have total occupation immediately upon payment of 10-1/2 lakhs under the table, 1-1/2 lakhs down. We cannot take on the responsibility of vacating the first floor tenant. So you can write me in London and let me know what is the decision. I will be going there by the first week of August.

So if Bhativalla is trying to evict us on legal grounds, and he cannot be defeated, then we will vacate. That is all right. Then, if we are unable to secure the Vakil house or some suitable place, then you should pack up and everyone immediately go to Mayapur. We have got some land there and the program is going on. So you can make plans accordingly.

Your idea for a three day benefit to raise 4 lakhs towards our International University for Study of Vedic Culture is a very sound proposal, so do it and make the idea concrete. That will be very good.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. The ad is all right, provided you can keep all the promises made.
