New Vrndavana

My dear Damodara Pandit das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1975 with the enclosed versification of the chanting of the song sung by Lord Siva. It is all right.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
