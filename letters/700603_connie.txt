My dear Srimati Connie,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter dated nil.

Your observation of the karmis is very accurate. The karmis are stated in the Bhagavad-gita as __mudha__ or fools. They are always full of anxieties on account of accepting temporary things which are not auspicious for their advancement. These karmis can smile very nicely when they take to Krsna consciousness---so our mission is to see everyone bright-faced. Lord Caitanya wanted to distribute this Holy Name in every city and town of the world; and in pursuance of His lotus feet we are trying to advance this Krsna consciousness chanting movement. Try to help us by your life, money, words, and intelligence. These four things are possessed by everyone, the degrees may be various, but Krsna is not concerned with the degrees, He wants to see the quality.

If you love Krsna and offer something in devotion, never mind it is a little water, a small fruit, a small flower, Krsna accepts that. If anything is accepted by Krsna that goes to our credit making our path of liberation open. So please try to help our movement to your best capacity, and it will be very good for you and the persons who hear you.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
