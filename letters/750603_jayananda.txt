====== Letter to: Jayananda ======

San Francisco

My dear Jayananda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. The book, "Hare Krishna and the Counterculture" written by Professor Judah, the copy of which was presented to you was lying here at Honolulu temple. I have read it with great interest. Just to congratulate the Professor, I am enclosing herewith a letter to him. I do not know his address therefore I am sending it through you. I wish to present him also one copy of the book titled, "Lord Caitanya in Five Features." So, kindly immediately see him with my letter and the book and congratulate him on my behalf.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
