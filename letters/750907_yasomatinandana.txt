My dear Yasomatinandana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 11, 1975 with the enclosed letter from Laksmana devi dasi. I have already sent a telegram that I accept her for brahminical initiation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
