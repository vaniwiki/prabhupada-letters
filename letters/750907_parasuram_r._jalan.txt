Dear Parasuram Jalan,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 1, 1975. Becoming a life member of this movement is not the necessary thing. Life membership is a side issue. We want people like you to co-operate with this movement. We want you to work for this movement. This is essential. You must know the philosophy and try to co-operate. Money is not important thing. Money is sent by Krsna.

The thing is that unless one understands the philosophy that the human life is meant for understanding Krsna, then simply a group of men such as you propose of the Jaycees, this will not help us. We have to impress upon all men the importance of this movement. Therefore people should be given the chance to hear somehow or other, to hear the philosophy of Krsna consciousness.

So my suggestion is that some of the intelligent men of Ranchi are welcome to stay here with me and try to understand the philosophy of Krsna consciousness. Then it'll be easier for you to start a center there. So you are invited to come and one who cooperates with this movement, he is the real life member. I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
