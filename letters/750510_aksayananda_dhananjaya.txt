====== Aksayananda, Dhananjaya ======

Vrndavana

My dear Aksayananda Swami and Dhananjaya,

Please accept my blessings. Kindly send me report of Vrndavana, how things are going on there, to our Honolulu address: 51 Coelho Way, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. The proposal for selling rooms should be dropped for the time being unless you take instruction from Giriraja how to take contributions from the prospective clients. For the time being, you organize the paying guest proposal.

Whether you have arranged for Dr. Varma's stay in our guest house? He is an experienced physician, perfectly qualified. Try to accommodate him as a honorary physician of our guest house. Please let me know how things are going on there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
