====== Amogha ======

Bombay

My dear Amogha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 18, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

You may remain in Bombay and assist with the temple management in cooperation with Giriraja das. I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
