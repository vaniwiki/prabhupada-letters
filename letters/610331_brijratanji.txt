Bombay

My dear Brijratanji,

Kindly accept my greetings. I hope you are quite well in all respects by the Grace of the Lord.

I beg to inform you that an international congress for cultivating Human Spirit is going to be held in Japan in the month of May 1961 and you will be glad to know that the Japanese organizers have invited me to attend the congress. They have already taken from me in advance the copy of my views on Human Culture and their second letter confirms it that they are very much anxious to receive me there. From the copy of the enclosed certificate, you will find it that they have arranged for my boarding and lodging during the days of my stay there.

Now I request you to arrange for my passage to Japan and oblige. Last you were ready to bear my passage expenses from India to South America. And as I could not get the No objection certificate I had to postpone the journey. This time there is no such question and the passage expenses to Japan are far less than South America.

Kindly therefore do the needful immediately and give me a chance to speak to the enlightened people of the world the message of Human Culture from the Vedic literatures. I am sure such views will change the angle of vision of the world activities.

Awaiting your early reply to the __above camp Address__ and thanking you in anticipation.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
