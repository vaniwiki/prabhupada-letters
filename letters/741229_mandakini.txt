====== Mandakini ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Mandakini,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22, December 1974 and have noted the contents carefully.

You mentioned in your letter that you are getting only a tourist visa for Moscow. But my original plan was that by marrying this man you would be able to get a permanent resident/permit there in Russia as his wife. But apparently this is very difficult. Therefore I think for now you should remain there in %%__%%, executing your devotional service, preaching nicely, caring for the Deities nicely. Try to get some type of permanent residence permit for Russia. If you can not get this residence permit then I think it is better not to go there. We shall see as Krsna desires.

Please continue engaging in Krsna's service with staunch determination, not to be defeated and engaged in Maya's service even for one second.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
