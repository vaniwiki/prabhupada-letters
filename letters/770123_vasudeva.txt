====== Vasudeva ======

My dear Vasudeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 13rd January and have noted the contents. Yes, Krsna will give you strength because you are so sincere. I simply want to see that you, your wife and your whole family become perfect Vaisnavas, Krsna's devotees. Remain in your position and try to understand the philosophy---that will make you perfect. Jnane prayasam udapasya namanta eva, jivanti sanmukharitam bhavadiya-vartam, sthane sthitah sruti-gatam tanuvan-manobhir, ye prayaso jita jito-py asi tais tri-lokyam. Ramananda Raya said (to Lord Caitanya), "Lord Brahma said (to Krsna), 'My dear Lord, those devotees who have thrown away the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth and have therefore abandoned discussing empiric philosophical truths should hear from self-realized devotees about Your holy name, form, pastimes and qualities. They should completely follow the principles of devotional service and remain free from illicit sex, gambling, intoxication, and animal slaughter. Surrendering themselves fully with body, words and mind, they can live in any asrama or social status. Indeed, You are conquered by such persons, although You are always unconquerable.' " (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya-lila Ch. 8 Text 67)

The purport is, don't become over intelligent. Just hear from the self-realized soul. If you sincerely, seriously hear from the realized soul, then one day, although nobody can conquer Him, you will be able to conquer Krsna.

It is very good news that the temple will be ready in late March. I have now instructed Ramesvara Swami and Bali Mardan dasa Adhikari, who I have sent to Australia to help manage there, to make all the final arrangements for the Deities, pujaris, etc. Ramesvara will contact you very soon about these details. So far my going for the opening of the temple, and installing the Deities, if my health is physically fit, then I can come in late April or early May, and if the temple can be opened then. So please go on and do everything nicely and I will try to see you then.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
