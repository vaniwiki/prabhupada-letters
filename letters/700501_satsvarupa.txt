My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28th April, 1970, along with a note from a boy in Spain. I have replied the boy, and the letter is enclosed herewith, please forward it to him.

I am very glad to learn that you have the Prahlada pictures in your safe custody because I want to print up many small books with text accompanied by illustrations, and the first one may be of Prahlada Maharaja. Sometime ago you wrote me that you wanted some new topics for writing subjects, so I think you can begin by compiling information from my past lectures on Prahlada Maharaja, then add the pictures and print it. Then you can do many other such books like this. Some other books may be about Dhruva Maharaja, Ajamila, etc., and I am sure these stories with their very significant purports will make very successful books, and they can be very easily sold. So if you can begin on this project and arrange everything carefully, that will be very nice.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
