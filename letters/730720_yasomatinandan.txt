====== Letter to: Yasomatinandan ======

Dear Yasomatinandan,

Please accept my blessings. I heard you were transferring to our Los Angeles center but I do not know if you have left our Chicago center yet, so I am sending copies of this letter to both places.

The thing is Brahmananda Maharaj is having difficulty translating literature into the Gujarat language in Nairobi. There is a large Gujarati population there and he has had some of our literature translated by a non-devotee translator. You know well the havoc which can result if a nondevotee tries to give his interpretation of Krsna. Although Krsna understanding is very easy for those who are simple and submissive devotees, for the duratma, Krsna is very difficult. So if at all possible we want all our foreign language books to be translated by devotees. I think you are already working on Gujarati translations of our works, so please immediately correspond with Brahmananda Maharaj at our Nairobi center and offer your services as translator. Take this as a great responsibility and it will please me very much. I will be glad to hear your progress in this important matter.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
