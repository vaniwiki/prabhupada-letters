====== Tulsidas ======

San Diego

My dear Tulsidas,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 18th, 1970, and I am so glad to learn that your center's activities are having their transcendental effect on the local population. It is sure and certain that if you all continue to follow the rigid schedule of chanting sixteen rounds daily with vow, going on Sankirtana and studying our literatures will increase your spiritual power to attract more sincere persons to Krsna Consciousness. So please see that all the devotees in your center are performing their regular duties in Krsna Consciousness and everything will be all right by Krsna's Grace.

Please keep your lives absorbed in transcendental loving service to the Lord and be happy. Your increased Temple activities chanting two hours before the altar, three hours of studying scriptures, etc., is very nice. Please continue this program and spread Krsna Consciousness vigorously.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there, Rsabhadeva, Vanamali, Bhaktadasa, Ezekiel, etc.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
