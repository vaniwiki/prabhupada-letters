Dear Mrs. Forkash:

Please accept my greetings. I beg to thank you for the nice "Parents for Krishna" newsletter dated March, 1977. It is very nicely done. This newsletter should be sent to all the parents of our devotees. Just recently the mother of one of our senior devotees, Mrs. L. H. Gibline, whose son is Jayapataka Swami, Director of our Mayapur Project, visited Mayapur West Bengal as well as our other Indian centres. She was very much impressed with the deep philosophy and roots which our movement has within the culture of India. You can communicate with her at the following address:

Mrs. L. H. Giblin

6171 No. Sheridan Road,

Chicago, Illinois 60660 USA\\
I am sure she would be very pleased to be an active assistant. If the parents of our devotees study the philosophy of Krishna consciousness there is no doubt they will benefit equally as their children are now doing.

I hope this meets you well.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
