Vrindaban

My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 18 and 28 March, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. The fencing estimate, sometimes you say Rs. 4000, sometimes Rs. 5000, so I think you have no good idea about these things, because it will not cost more than Rs. 1500. I understand that you have taken quotation from contractor. Don't go through contractor. So anything to be sent in this connection must be done personally and in conjunction with Gurudasa. The cost shall not exceed Rs. 1500 for the fencing.

The first thing is that I am very much anxious for Hindi BTG composition. It must done immediately, otherwise how you can get it from Japan? It will take three to four months for each issue, so layout should be done four months ahead. Then in due time the printed copies will be received. So you concentrate on this point very seriously, and if Dr. Ramananda Rao is not sending translations, then you should translate and ask Radharamana Goswami to translate. This is the most important task.

Why you are asking me for photos? The photo business Gurudasa knows, he will supply you.

Regarding Gauracand Goswami, the Rs. 10/- is our monthly contribution towards seva puja. You can continue that, it has nothing to do with rent. Simply give and take a receipt, that's all.

I am advising Saurabha das, our new Holland devotee in Bombay, who is an expert designer, to draw up the plans for Vrindaban project, and he will be sending you in due course. Meanwhile you must stockpile enormous quantities of cement, sand, rock chips, bricks, etc., along with steel, so you may cooperate with Gurudasa and others to work very hard for securing ample supply of these things. Gargamuni is collecting funds in Bombay for Vrindaban scheme, so he will be in charge of getting money, and you may also help by getting rich men to contribute.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
