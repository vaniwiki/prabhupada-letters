====== Sridama ======

My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter (undated), and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased that you are doing nicely in Philadelphia temple, and Subala has written to me that you are a great help to him there. Regarding Rohini Devi, don't worry about her. Perhaps Krishna wishes you to remain brahmacari. You were not willing to marry, but she insisted. Now she has been taken away by her father; so you may take it as Krishna's Desire. If you decide to remain as brahmacari, then I may call you back for my personal assistance when I return to the States. I was very much pleased with your service. May Krishna bless you more and more.

On the reverse side you will find an article which was published in __The Sun,__ a popular English newspaper. Please convey my thanks to Subala for his letter to me dated September 15th, 1969. I am very much encouraged to see how he is gaining skill in managing a temple nicely. Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
