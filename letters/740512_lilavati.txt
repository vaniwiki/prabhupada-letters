====== Lilavati ======

My dear Lilavati,

Please accept my blessings. As for your questions you have asked for clarification in the KRSNA Book when Maha Visnu says to Krsna and Arjuna that you are my incarnations in my appearance as Nara-Narayana. So you are asking how this can be so. The answer is when Krsna comes all the incarnations are within him. Actually this is a very intricate question. So not be so concerned about it now. When you become more advanced you will be able to realize these things.

You have asked if the Yadu dynasty has continued beyond Satasena. Yes, there are ksatriyas who claim to belong to the Yadu dynasty today especially in Mathura and nearby places.

How to acquire the quality of patience. Caitanya Mahaprabhu has already given us that answer: One can chant the Holy Name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the straw in the street, more tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the Holy Name of the Lord constantly. So there will be, that in our preaching we will meet with many tribulations, that is patience.

So I understand you are recuperating from an operation. So spend this extra time reading all our books, chanting as many rounds as possible, and if you can go on doing my tapes.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
