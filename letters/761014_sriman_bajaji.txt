====== Sriman Bajaji ======

Bombay

Dear Sriman Bajaji,

I thank you very much for your letter dated October 4, 1976, I have noted the contents carefully. I accept your invitation. I will advise Giriraja, my secretary in Bombay to see you in this connection. I wish to take with me my sankirtana party whether you would like to accommodate them. If not then only my personal secretaries, all together five, will go with me, so you have to arrange accommodation for them.

I am sending a copy of this letter to Giriraja to do the needful.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
