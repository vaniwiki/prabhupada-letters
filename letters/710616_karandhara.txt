====== Karandhara ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th June, 1971 addressed to Bombay as well as a copy of the letter addressed 3d June, 1971. Still I am here in Bombay and have not yet gone to London. My program is that on the 20th instant I will go to Moscow for five days and from there I will be going to Paris and London. I have inquired, but it doesn't seem that there are any direct flights available from Moscow to Los Angeles, so it may not be possible for me to reach San Francisco in time for Rathayatra festival. Still, if it is at all possible, I shall try my best. Otherwise I shall participate in the festival in London.

You will be glad to know that I have written one letter to Dai Nippon asking that they suspend printing of Penguin series KRSNA book for the time being. And so far as the $6,000 saved up for repaying the loan of $20,000 for BTG, it may be sent to the Press for printing of Bhagavad-gita.

So if the book distribution program is going so nicely, then we should produce books on our own press in great quantity. I have written Rupanuga one letter, the essence of which is that $15,000 worth of books, at our cost and not at face value, should be printed each month and distributed. Since it was formerly agreed that the press would charge 10% of the total costs for maintenance, so if $15,000 worth of books are printed then the $1,500 per month maintenance cost is taken care of. Other than that, our press operation is not economically sound proposal. But if books can be produced to the extent of $15,000 per month, then it is all right.

There is no need of sending more checks. Hold on to them. What you have sent to London, I will get when I arrive there. I have received no duplicate deposit slip receipt for $660 in my account at Bank of America. It was not enclosed. You needn't come to N.Y. since I will be going directly to Los Angeles from N.Y.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
