====== Radhavallabha ======

Los Angeles

My dear Radhavallabha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated August 25 and 31 and have noted the contents.

Concerning the editing of Jayadvaita Prabhu, whatever he does is approved by me. I have confidence in him. Your changes which I have seen of the sanskrit synonyms is also approved by me. Tanmayataya refers to the fact that the trees and the father were absorbed in the same feelings.

Titling of the Ninth Canto as Liberation is good, and the Tenth Canto should be called "The Summum Bonum". As far as the 11th and 12th Cantos are concerned they shall be named when they are presented. The title which you have given to the Eighth Canto was a little hard to understand at first but if it refers to pralaya, then it is alright. You must consult with me on such matters. Do not manufacture anything.

All of the sketches which you have sent to me while I am in India are approved. The picture of the Mohini Murti capturing the demons should take place outside on grass, there is no floor or walls. Prahlada Maharaja does not have a beard. Always avoid beards. It is not true that there are no shoes in Krsna lila, rather there are shoes except for the Vrndavana pastimes. But the shoes are of another quality, they are beautiful with jewels etc. On the battlefield they must wear shoes. The severed head of Rahu should look like the head of a demon, not round like a planet.

By controlling sex desire one becomes the most perfect sober person, __kandutivan manasajivam visaheta dhirah.__ I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
