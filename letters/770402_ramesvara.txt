====== Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Rameswar,

Please accept my blessings.

Now we are forming scientists party and we shall try with their help to establish Krishna consciousness as the genuine scientific movement of the world exposing the so-called scientists as nothing but speculators. Svarupa Damodara has received very good response here in India from the scientific community and there is good hope that many others will join him. He is returning to America for preparing some publications and when these are completed I have asked him to tour vigorously throughout the world lecturing with his other colleagues at all major institutions and universities. He has drawn up a budget of immediate needs, a copy of which is enclosed and I immediately sanction this amount. Whatever expenditure he requires supply him immediately from the BBT. I am prepared to give $10,000 or more monthly if required to finance this most important preaching program. So whatever money Svarupa Damodara needs must be supplied monthly and he will send you accounts.

You can save this money by minimizing the expenditures in the luxury departments of Sanskrit and artists. We do not want these departments for the time being. One or two men must suffice for Sanskrit work. There is no need of new paintings. Whatever paintings we have, that is enough. There is no need of constantly making new variations on the same themes. So for the art department no more expenditure. If they want to continue painting let them come and live here in Bombay or in any of our other temples in India. We have got sufficient facilities now for accommodation and in this way we can save so much money.

Svarupa Damodara has requested that Dravida das may come and help him with editing work. The scientists are publishing some booklets to be completed by their return here on Janmastami. If possible please arrange for Dravida das to join them.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
