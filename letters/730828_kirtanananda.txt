====== Letter to: Kirtanananda ======

My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to %%__%% receipt of your telegram recommending new initiates. Their names are as follows:

Robert---Vahna Das

Joanne---Visvadhika Dasi

Richkin---Mahabuddhi Das

Robert---Padmanyayana Das

George Crocker---Cirantana Das

Frank Chiesa---Candramauli Das

Ken Karpovich---Krsnasravana Das

Rachel Sullivan---Vedajanani Dasi

I am happy to hear that your program was successful, here also we had some nice programs, and in Amsterdam we also staged a nice festival. So this festival program is very very important and it is especially effective for the mass of people. So go on making festivals and make everyone in America Krishna conscious.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
