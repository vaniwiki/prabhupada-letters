Dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter dated August 17, 1972, and I thank you very much for your kind words. I am happy to hear that you are beginning your translation work and you are translating "Sri Gurvastkam" presently. You have completed your examinations well, so Krishna has blessed you with good intelligence, now employ that gift by Krishna by serving Him only, then your life will be complete and you will be always really happy. If you are always remembering Him by your activities and seeing Krishna everywhere, even in the heart of the demonic persons, then anger will never overcome you, being purified of all false pride. But occasionally if there is good reason, you may have to become angry just to chastise the evil-doers and blasphemers. We have seen that Lord Caitanya once nearly killed Jagai and Madhai for their offenses to His devotee, so, like that, if there is offensive behavior to the pure devotees you may become like Nrsimhadeva and punish them severely.

I am coming to India by middle of October, to Vrindaban, so it is likely you can see me there, as I shall remain there one month. Meanwhile, hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
