My dear Gurudasa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter undated and delivered by hand.

The Krishna conscious Katha contest and the workshops appear to be very nice. This is our only business---to endeavor to serve Krishna at every moment. The whole world is busy for sense gratification, it is anthill civilization. So much endeavor for what? We also work hard because we know the goal of life---to please Krishna. So if by these workshops service to Krishna has been increased in everyone, then they are very nice. Why there was no weaving and spinning workshop?

On the map of Vrndavana it is still called Chattikara Road. Also still on the letterhead. If the municipality has decided to rename the road in my name, why it is not yet changed?

In my room at Radha Damodara Temple you should keep one photo of me and offer to it Prasadam of Sri Radha Damodara.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
