My dear Paul Diglio,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and I am glad to know that you have a sincere interest in this Krsna consciousness movement. Now you should try to become strong in Krsna consciousness. The first thing is to chant 16 rounds minimum on the beads and it is best to do this in the association of others who also desire to progress in spiritual life. So you should try to remain at one of our temples; that will help you. You should also read my books very carefully and you should render service. __Tad viddhi pranipatena/ pariprasnena sevaya__ [[books:bg:4:34|(Bg. 4.34)]]. Service must be there. So you have to find out some service that you can render. Then your progress will be very quick.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
