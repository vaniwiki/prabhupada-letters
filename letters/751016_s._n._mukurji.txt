My dear sir,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5/8, and I have noted the contents carefully. In India we have got so many centres. Which ever is convenient for you, you can join and live with us.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
