My dear Kirtika devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 5th and have noted the contents carefully. Regarding your questions. If your prayers are sincere then Krishna will accept them and if Krishna accepts them then automatically I accept them, and if I accept them then automatically Krishna accepts them. So like this Krishna is everywhere. He is even between the atoms. So therefore wherever you are He will accept your prayers, and therefore I automatically accept. But the most important part again, the prayer must be sincere.

The proper method of dressing Jagannatha is as a Ksatriya king and there is no limit to the opulence you can give Him. I am here in Australia, and will be returning to India by March 2nd., after travelling through New Zealand and Indonesia. I will be returning to America in mid-April and I hope to see you then. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
