My dear Lynn,

Please accept by blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter (undated) and I thank you for it. It is very nice and encouraging. Krishna Consciousness is so nice that if one takes part in it in either ways, like hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, praying, or even simply by eating prasadam, the transcendental effect will be visible. I am very glad that you have developed these nice sentiments and now you are living with other devotees. If you continue like this I am sure you will make rapid progress in Krishna Consciousness. I am returning to San Francisco very soon and soon after that I shall go to your city also. When I meet you, surely you shall be initiated. I thank you once more for you nice appreciation.
