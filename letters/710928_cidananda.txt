====== Cidananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 12th and 15th September, 1971 respectively and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear how you are doing well. I am always thinking of you and praying to Krishna when you will be relieved and join us again. But in any circumstance simply go on chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra and think of Krishna always.

So you should take it that your hospitalization is an opportunity of chanting Hare Krishna mantra 24 hours. After all we are not this body so bodily disorders cannot hamper our advancement in Krishna Consciousness. So long the tongue is active we can chant. Even if the tongue is not active we can think of Krishna. Someway or other if we can keep in touch with Krishna that is our success of life.

Yes, taking meat was undoubtedly a great offense, so don't do it again consciousness or unconsciously. Krishna will excuse you for whatever you have done, but don't do it again.

Hoping this will find you in rapidly improving health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
