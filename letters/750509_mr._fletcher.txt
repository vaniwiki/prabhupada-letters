My dear Mr. Fletcher,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 9th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your kind sentiment. You are very fortunate to be taking part in the Krishna Consciousness movement. If you take it very seriously, then you will not have to take another birth in this miserable material world. You can go back to home, back to Godhead at the end of this life. So, my request is that you take it up very boldly and finish your business in this material world.

I hope to see you in Melbourne. I will be arriving on the 17th of May and leaving on the 21st of May.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
