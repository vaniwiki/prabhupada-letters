====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter recommending new Brahmin initiates.\\
Perform a fire ceremony and have a feast. Sacred threads are enclosed.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
