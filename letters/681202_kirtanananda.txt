====== Kirtanananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received today your letter of Nov. 30th, 1968 and have noted the contents. I can understand from your letter that you are little concerned with remaining in New Vrindaban while the others are away, but in this connection you must remember that factually, you are not alone because you are always being protected by Lord Krishna. So I think that it is best that you stick to New Vrindaban, chant Hare Krishna, worship the deities and Krishna will send you help in men and money. So do not be agitated. If no one will come then you may live alone with Krishna and I am sure that Krishna will give you all facilities for progress in the very near future. Of course, you are always welcome to come see me, but while there is no one else to remain and to tend the deities, I think it best if you shall stay.

So far as your question about arranging time, our first business is to regularly complete our chanting 16 rounds each day. Then we must offer to the deities mangal arati in the morning, and the other paraphernalia and activities shall be executed as time permits. If there is no time then we must disregard.

When George Henderson shall becoming there try to keep him there to associate with you. Try discussing and convincing him of the principles of Krishna Consciousness. He is a good soul, I know, and if he can help you in New Vrindaban, it will be very nice. If he comes to see me in Los Angeles, I shall talk with him. In the beginning, he was taking Krishna Consciousness seriously but because he left our association he became slackened, so if again he may associate with us it will be so nice.

Hope this letter finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
