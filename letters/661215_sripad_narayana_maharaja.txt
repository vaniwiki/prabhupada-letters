Sri Sri Vaisnava Carana Dandavat nati Purvikeyam\\
I am offering my dandavat pranaamas to the Vaisnavas' lotus feet and then I am writing.

Sripad Narayana Maharaja,\\
After receiving your letter of the 13th of November and hearing of your difficulty, I replied to you on the 19th of November. In that letter I instructed you to deposit Rs 1500/- into my account at the Vrndavana Punjab National Bank. If you have not deposited the money yet, please let me know if you have purchased the goods or not. I came to know that my disciple Candrasekhara from Delhi wrote you a letter. Candrasekhara sent me a copy of your reply to him. In that letter I came to know that foolish Candrasekhara had blasphemed you. Fools do not know how to honor Vaisnavas. By your greatness, please excuse him. I haven't instructed him to do such a thing. I only told him to visit you. Anyway, excuse his aparadha. Candrasekhara is a good man, but out of foolishness he used bad words to you. You please forgive him and me by your good qualities.

If you have not deposited the money in the Pujab National Bank, you can arrange for the purchase of Deities (Sri Vigrahas). They asked Rs 700/- for a pair of Deities. But if they accept Rs 1200/- for two pairs of Deities, buy them. Pack it properly in a box and send it to my supplying agent (Bakeswar) how to write even I do not know. But write me like this. As-

Soon after you receive my letter let me know what arrangement you have made. I hope you are well.

Affectionately yours,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
