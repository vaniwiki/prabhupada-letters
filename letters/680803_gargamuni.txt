====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter via New York, dated July 23, 1968. The bicycle accident may be ignored, because even if there is a case against you, you can plead that the man was going, and all of a sudden he turned imbalance, and dashed with my car. So it was his fault, he could not keep balance with the cycle. And as soon as I saw him dashed, I stopped immediately and what could I do more? In India such accidents are never taken seriously by the police, because in busy streets, cycling is prohibited. So your decision not to pay him any money is right. Besides that, if he was to institute a case against you, he should have at once reported the matter to the policy nearby.

Regarding your business: This ebb tide and flow tide of business we should always expect. But so far I know that you do more business by traveling. Under the circumstances, the showroom you are keeping is extra expense. I do not know who looks after your store in your absence. So you can take action according to the necessity of business, because we must use our full intelligence in any matter. Anyway, if you find it too much inconvenient to stay in San Francisco, you can come to Vancouver or London.

I hope you are feeling well, and similarly all your God-brothers and sisters there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
