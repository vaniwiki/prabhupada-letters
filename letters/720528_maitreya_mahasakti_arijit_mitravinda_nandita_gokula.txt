Denver

My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Tulasi dasa I am very glad to consent to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. I am giving him your beads duly chanted by me. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Mike Stitch/Maitreya dasa Brahmacari.\\
Mark Jahre/Mahasakti dasa Brahmacari.\\
Allen Bigil/Arijit dasa Brahmacari.\\
Marsha Arslansky/Mitravinda devi dasi.\\
Nancy Bailey/Nandita Gokula devi dasi.

I am so glad to learn that you are such good assistants for Tulasi dasa there in our Denver center. And I can understand that you are all very eligible candidates for going back to Home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Simply follow the regulative principles with determination, and you will become free from all attachment to maya, by Krishna's Grace. The example is when the sun is in the sky, there is no question of darkness. Similarly, when Hare Krishna Mantra is vibrating on your tongue and you are hearing attentively, then your consciousness becomes clear or Krishna Consciousness, and there is no question of maya or hazy consciousness. Just as when the light and the darkness come together, the darkness cannot stand before the light, so maya cannot remain in the presence of Krishna. Always remember therefore to chant Hare Krishna, and that will save you in all circumstances without any doubt.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
