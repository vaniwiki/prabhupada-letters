====== Krsnanandini ======

Nashville, Tennessee

My dear Krsnandini Devi Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I be to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9/25/72, which has just now been forwarded to me from Vrindaban. So there has been some delay. Please do not be disturbed. So for the time being you may call the baby Bhakta Gaura, and then initiated can take place when she is grown more, not now. So you are my initiated disciple, and I must instruct you to be sure to always follow the regulative principles like chanting 16 rounds on the beads daily, reading my books, eating only prasadam, and in every way trying to serve Krsna. This will keep you purified and help you to advance more and more in spiritual life. So try as much as possible to associate with our devotees and to bring up your baby firmly in Krsna Consciousness. This will be the success of your life.

I hope this finds you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
