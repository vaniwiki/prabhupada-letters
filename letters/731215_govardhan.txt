====== Govardhan ======

My dear Govardhan,

Please accept my blessings. I hereby accept the devotees you have recommended for first and second initiation. Enclosed are three threads and six gayatri sheets for the second initiates. Hold a fire yajna, after which they may listen to the mantra once through the right ear from the cassette tape I have made.

The spiritual names of the first initiates are as follows:

Patrick - Khandaparasu dasa

Donale - Daruna dasa

Don Pearson - Dravinaprada dasa

Chuck - Caturbhava dasa

Judy - Rangavati dasi

All the devotees should collect Guru-daksina and send it to Karandhar in Los Angeles.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
