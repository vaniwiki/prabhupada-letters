My Dear Nolen, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your nice poetic letter and I am so glad that you have begun to appreciate the sublime nature of Krsna consciousness as you have experienced being with our disciples for some months.

The simple method of Lord Caitanya is to chant the Hare Krsna Mahamantra sincerely, without offence of ten different kinds and one will very quickly come to the stage of ultimate happiness of life as opposed to the miserable conditions experienced by wandering back and forth in the material existence. So I am requesting you to kindly go on chanting Hare Krsna Mantra with determination to become a pure devotee of the Lord, and He will be pleased upon you to give you all facilities for advancing in His service. That will make your life both joyful and perfect.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
