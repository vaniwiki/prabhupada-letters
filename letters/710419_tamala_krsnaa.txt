====== Tamala Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
Calcutta

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Your first letter has been duly replied and this evening I have received two telegrams from you acknowledging receipt of the first check as well as asking for power of attorney. The second check, no. CHT/A-T492827 for Rs. 9,700/- is also enclosed herewith. Please find, and acknowledge receipt by telegram. In the mean time I have received a letter and telephone message from Krsna das in Germany. Most probably I shall have to go to Russia for a fortnight. So my passport is immediately necessary. I think Amritanananda and Rahul may be required to go with us because their names have been suggested. So Rahul may be in uncle's house.

The power of attorney will follow by express mail. Whether you have dispatched the money from Calcutta to the book fund and building fund and the membership statement also? That is urgent. Enclosed please find a photo copy of Birla's letter, as well as a letter from Karandhara addressed to you. We shall send the marble deities as soon as they can be packed.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
