====== Letter to: Sama Priya ======

Boulder Creek, Ca.

My dear Sama Priya devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 30, 1975 with enclosed checks for Dollars 50.00 and 5.00. Thank you very much for it. I appreciate your sentiments for your spiritual master, and I will pray to Krsna for your continued spiritual advancement. You simply have to keep yourself always in the fire of Krishna consciousness. Read my books daily, chant 16 rounds, and worship Lord Caitanya in your home. If you do this maya will never touch you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
