====== Trivikrama ======

My dear Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Replying your letter dated December 17th, 1975, I beg to inform you that until the next meeting of the GBC no new arrangements can be made. Now Gurukrpa Maharaja is being sent to Japan, and as he is already the GBC, you both should work cooperatively. That is the best thing. After all, it is all Krishna's business; there is no personal considerations. When you all come to the Mayapur festival, at that time all suggestions will be heard and the needful will be done.

I am very glad to know that you want to recruit devotees. Unless we get local devotees it is very difficult to maintain. So try to maintain the center with local devotees, that is my urgent desire.

Regarding the "dust" supposedly brought from the moon, that dust can be gotten anywhere. It has already been openly admitted that the same dust is available on this earth planet. These astronauts and scientists are all bluffing. But Srila Vyasadeva is the correct authority. Just study Srimad-Bhagavatam carefully with full faith in Krishna and Guru and all knowledge will be revealed.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
