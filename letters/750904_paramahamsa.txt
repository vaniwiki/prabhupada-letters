My dear Paramahamsa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 21, 1975 with enclosed check for U.S. 1,000. I have not received the letter you say you sent to Paris with a second check for U.S. 1,000. You should immediately inquire.

Regarding Manasvi, you should immediately prosecute. The charge should be Breach of Trust and Misappropriation of Funds. I have received today the Oath of Allegiance duly signed by him and notarized. When required it will be supplied to you. Therefore I wanted this declaration. Immediately prosecute.

Regarding the restaurant, that is the defect, that if we divert our attention more on business. Therefore it is very difficult. Things should be adjusted so that temple programs are not hampered. The brahmacaris and sannyasis must stick to the temple activities. Only the grhasthas can take part in the restaurant. Our aim should not be to work for profit. You American boys and girls can make very large profit, but why you have taken to Krishna consciousness? You are not meant for profit making but for advancing in spiritual life. So we should not take to the restaurant for profit making at the cost of slackening of spiritual life. This is dangerous.

Manasvi is getting a job, but what about the money? Ask him.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
