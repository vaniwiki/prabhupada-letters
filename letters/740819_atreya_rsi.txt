====== Letter to: Atreya Rsi ======

Tehran

My dear Atreya Rsi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 28th 1974. I am glad to note that you had nice Rathayatra festival for the Indian community there. I am especially pleased to note that for Vyasa Puja and Janmastami you have so many Iranian devotees there. This is your real success if you can convince the local men to become Krishna Conscious. This is preaching. You know that I went to your country America alone. None of my godbrothers helped me. But, I was able to convince you to become Krishna Conscious. Now you can convince others. This is Krishna Consciousness.

Please increase the preaching activities there and I will surely visit you there on the next opportunity.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
