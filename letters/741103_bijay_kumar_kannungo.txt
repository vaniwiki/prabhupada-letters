Dear Sri Kannungo:

Please accept my blessings. I would like to especially invite you to come here to Bombay. We have kept two rooms vacated for you, so you can come with your wife and family to visit.

I hope this meets you and your family in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
