My Dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3rd May, 1971 and have noted the contents. That New Vrindaban is developing so nicely is very much encouraging to me, so increase it more and more. It is sounding so much attractive and making me want to return to U.S.A. even sooner.

We are now very busy in Calcutta on account of our 'Hare Krishna' festival and we are drawing 30,000 people daily. You will be glad to know that we have purchased two pieces of land in Mayapur at Rs. 20,000/- and they are going to construct some nice temple there.

Regarding other matters, better you settle up things amongst the GBC members. I have created GBC members for peaceful negotiation of management affairs. But if you GBC members sometimes agree and sometimes disagree, that is not very good for management. But if sometimes you have disagreements, I shall settle them up. Soon I shall be returning to U.S.A. and I shall meet you all there.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
