====== Letter to: Prabudha ======

Miami

My dear Prabudha dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 2, 1976.

Regarding the sales and distribution of your fruits, please kindly work out the details with Abhirama and Satsvarupa Maharaja. Satsvarupa Maharaja is GBC and senior man, he knows everything about prasadam distribution.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
