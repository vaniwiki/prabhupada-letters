My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12th May, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far as your relocating your temple from Tucson to Phoenix, that is a GBC matter and so it should be discussed with the GBC members and especially with Karandhara Prabhu. I cannot suggest anything very well from such a distant place.

Presently I am in Bombay and from here I shall be going to London and perhaps to Moscow for a few days also. Then I shall be going to N.Y. and on to Los Angeles. At that time Michael and Patrick may come to be initiated.

Yes, you always have my blessings. Just go on and work sincerely to push on this movement and you will have the blessings of Caitanya Mahaprabhu as well. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
