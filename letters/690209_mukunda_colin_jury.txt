====== Mukunda, Colin Jury ======

My dear Mukunda and Colin Jury,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your joint letters dated February 3, 1969. Pending your searching out a suitable temple-house, immediately rent a suitable apartment for me from the 1st of March, 1969, and on hearing from you, I shall start for London by the end of this month. When I go there I am sure I shall find out a suitable temple-house. Please let me know your decision on this matter so that I may prepare for my London-Yatra.

Offer my blessings to all of my beloved sons and daughters who are so kind and affectionate to me. Awaiting your early reply with interest.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
