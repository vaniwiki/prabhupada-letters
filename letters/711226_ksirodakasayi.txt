My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I understand that you are not with the devotees. I do not know why you are living separately. In the Society there may be sometimes misunderstandings, but that does not mean you should live separately.

So far the Vrindaban land, if possible you should go there and induce the Chairman to give us the promised land. Gargamuni has written me letter that because you said to the chairman that Mr. Saraf is going to give us his land, therefore he was reluctant. So you go there and inform him that Mr. Saraf is not giving us the land, although he promised, and persuade him to give us the municipal land some way or other. Go there immediately, and inform me the result. Gargamuni is there to raise funds, so he will help you.

I am enclosing one letter to me from your son. I do not know why you are not writing them, but please do the needful, so that they shall not worry or be in anxiety.*

I hope this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*I am also in anxiety for not hearing from you.\\

You are not writing any letters to me, so I do not know where you are and what you are doing. The Hindi and Bengali BTG is in your charge, so I am always anxi[missing text] to know what you have done. Neither I have received any news about the Delhi land. So kindly clearly explain what is the actual position--I am very much anxious.

You are a senior devotee, and you have given up everything--wife, family, business, everything--to serve the Lord, so I am very much pleased by your attitude of renunciation and sacrifice, as well as your capable service. Now I want that we should produ[missing text] Hindi books and magazines profusely in India, so for that very very responsible position of supervising I have appointed you to be in charge. Please know it for certain that I am very much pleased by you in general, and that I shall be completely satisfied if you will see to it that many many books and magazines are published in Hindi language.

Somehow or other, out of all your millions of countrymen, you have practically alone surrendered to Krishna to render loving devotional service, at great loss to your material life, so you can know it for certain that Krishna is very much pleased also. Somehow or other I have got so many good assistants li[missing text] your good self, therefore there has been a little success. Thank you for helping me this way.
