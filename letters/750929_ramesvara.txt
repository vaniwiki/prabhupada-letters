====== Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 19, 1975 and have noted the contents. Why has Dr. Wolf gone against us? What is his complaint? Just consult with Svarupa Damodara.

Regarding the airport distribution, I have personally seen that they do not create any disturbance. They speak quietly and on the side, and no one is disturbed.

Yes, Swami Bon is envious. What can be done?

Here the Hare Krishna People film by Yadubara is very much appreciated. Just encourage Yadubara to make more films. He can do nicely.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. You have published the photo of Krishna Balarama Mandir in Caitanya Caritamrta. I want that this picture should be printed and 1000 copies may be sent to %Vrindaban and they can paste it on some boards, and people will purchase.
