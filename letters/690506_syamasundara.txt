====== Syamasundara ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter dated May 1, 1969, delivered by special express mail is very much thought-provoking. Actually, if we get that church in negotiation, it will be a great achievement. Mr. George Harrison is sometimes coming forward to help us and sometimes he is not straightforward. But because he is chanting Hare Krishna and he has some faith in Krishna, a little respect for me, I am sure he will come forward to help our movement.

The Rathayatra may be fixed up from the 20th July to the 27th July, seven days continually. In the meantime, if you get the church in contemplation, it will be very, very nice. I am sending the papers which may help in this connection. Enclosed is a short history of my previous life in continuation with the present life, and copies of certificates from different institutions which have developed since the departure of my Spiritual Master. We are all students of His Divine Grace Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami Maharaja Prabhupada. I am recognized as Ordained Minister of Religion in the United States of America, and in that status I am given permission of permanent resident, immigrant. So if these copies of certificates will help you to secure a church, then our London Yatra will be a grand success.

I am sending herewith also a rough plan of the proposed temple to be constructed by George Harrison. The plan is for inside temple structure and courtyard. This is only one side of the temple. Three other sides may be surrounded by living quarters.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Malati, and your nice child. I hope this will meet you all in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
