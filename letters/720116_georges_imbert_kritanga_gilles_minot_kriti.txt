====== Letter to: Georges Imbert, Kritanga, Gilles Minot, Kriti ======

My dear Sons,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Dhananjaya I have gladly consented to accept both of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Georges Imbert/ KRITANGA DAS

Gilles Minot/ KRITI DAS

I am so glad to learn that both of you have been such a great help to Dhananjaya there in our Amsterdam center. I can understand that both of you are very sincere boys and are very eligible candidates for going back to Home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

I hope this will meet you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
