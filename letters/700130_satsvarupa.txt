====== Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28 January, 1970.

In __Krishna__ book we want solid 400 pages text matter and 52 pictures. If you have got 40 paintings complete, then still you require 12 pictures more. There are 14 pictures hanging in my apartment here. Whether the 40 pictures includes these 14? On the whole, for the first part of __Krishna__ we want 52 pictures and 400 text pages---so whether they are complete? If not, you have to finish them as quickly as possible for sending them to Japan.

Regarding the tapes; I think the distribution to many centers is becoming puzzling. Therefore, I will send the tapes one to Boston and the other to Detroit alternately. I think that will solve the problem. So I will go on doing that, and you be in correspondence with Bhagavan das and do the needful. Regarding the demons' tilak: There is no necessity of putting Saivite tilaka on their foreheads, although most of the demons are like that. When there is particular mention that a demon is the devotee of Lord Siva, in that case the Saivite tilaka may be marked.

Regarding titles of the pictures, I think Jadurani will be a nice judge. Otherwise, unless I see the pictures, how can I give titles for them? The pictures which I have got here I can give titles, or if I get photographs of the pictures which are being painted there, then I can give titles for all the pictures.

Regarding Sridhara Swami's article: I do not know what sort of article it is, but whatever it may be, the writer's name should be Swami B. R. Sridhara and not Sridhara Swami. Sridhara Swami is a different man. Besides that, there is no need of giving any short introductory note at the present moment. Whoever sends an article for publication in our paper, and if we publish such article, it is to be understood that the version of such article is not different from ours. There is no need of discussing Siksha Guru and diksa Guru in this connection.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
