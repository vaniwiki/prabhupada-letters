Dear Sri Omkara Giri,

Please accept my greetings. We have heard about you from Mr. Rajendra Sahai. We extend an invitation to you to please come to Mayapur during GourPurnima, and if you come we will be prepared to pay you for your expenditures. (We observe this festival from the end of February to March 5th).

Yours sincerely,\\
