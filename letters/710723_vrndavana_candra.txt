My dear Vrndavana Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 20th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far as mixing with society, we can do it. That is all right. But simply for jobs sake, we cannot. To mix with them intimately is not good. So that should be avoided. Lord Caitanya never said stop mixing with nondevotees. He was preaching himself. How a preacher can stop? The whole world is nondevotees.

So far these plays are concerned, they are not meant for ordinary people and if they laugh, then that is a great offense. Just like in your play "Putana Killed" there was so much laughing. So these plays are not meant for the public showing unless they are very nicely done. The audience must give grave attention. If they laugh, that is the greatest offense. Lord Caitanya never played before ordinary men. Only before devotees. But for you to put on such plays for devotees only is not so practical. So plays of Krishna Lila should be avoided, unless it is very gravely performed.*

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Some instructive stories from Bhagavatam may be played before the general public.\\
