My dear Amarendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12-8-76.

Yes, civil disobedience will be the only method in this circumstance. But there are so many judgments in our favor. We should bring the matter in the court. We have the opinions of so many scholars. Bring the matter in the court. But if it is a state policy to cut down this Movement, then civil disobedience. What can be done?

As far as your wife is concerned, the only solution is that she become Krsna conscious. She should live in association with devotees, and strictly follow the regulative practices of Krsna consciousness. If you feel competent to give her the spiritual strength she needs then let her return to Gainesville, otherwise she can go to another temple. Let her read Bhagavad-gita every day.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept the devotees you have recommended for second initiation; Manusrestha dasa, Vaninatha Vasu dasa, Akincana Krsna dasa, Sranti dasi, Garuda Pandita dasa, Brhanti dasi. Now hold a fire sacrifice for devotees only. Play the tape of me chanting Gayatri mantra into the right ears of the devotees and teach them how to count on their finger divisions.

Regarding your question as to when the soul leaves the body, it is when the heart stops beating. Even if the brain has stopped functioning, if the heart is beating that means the soul is present.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
