My dear Giriraja das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that I have sent two separate telegraphic transfers in Indian Rupees to the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust a/c 16066, care of the Central Bank, Gowalia Tank Branch, Bombay. I am enclosing the two receipts, one for Rs. 8,857.15 and the other for Rs. 14,797.17. So the total amount is Rs. 23,654.32. Now please see that this is recorded in the passbook and inform me accordingly.

I had taken some Rs. 59,000/- from the BBT account, so you can deduct the Rs. 23,654.32 from this. Hence I must still give Rs. 35,345.68 towards this.

Tomorrow we go to Fiji for some time, and the laying of the foundation stone of our new temple there, then on to Hawaii, and by about June 1st, we should reach Los Angeles. After that we are planning to visit Detroit, New York Rathayatra tentatively scheduled in late June, then New Vrindaban. Before returning to India, we shall stopover in Europe for about 2 weeks, and possibly Tehran.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
