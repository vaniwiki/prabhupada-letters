Melbourne

My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram dated May 16. I have also received a previous telegram in which you said you sent us tickets Air India, London-Melbourne round trip. However I will not be going to London. My schedule is to leave tomorrow morning to Delhi-Vrndavana and on the 23rd of May go to Rome. Bhagavan Das has made a tour including Rome, Geneva and ending June 15 Paris. Thereafter Hansadutta has invited me to Amsterdam June 15. There is a meeting in Koln, Germany June 22. Immediately thereafter I can leave to Melbourne from Koln and stay as you requested through June 29. As regards to the tickets you have already sent I have not received them yet and we are leaving tomorrow. Moreover they are for London departure. I think the best thing to do is to cancel the tickets and arrange new tickets for us from Koln to Melbourne and return. You can mail these tickets to me care of Paris, France center so long as they reach there by June 14. My party consists of three; myself, Neil Delmonico (Nitai) and Stephen Guarino (Satsvarupa Maharaja), (Pradyumna has left us for sometime). I will expect your tickets when we arrive in Paris and I will be very pleased to attend the gorgeous Melbourne Ratha-yatra festival.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
