My dear Puranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated Jan. 6, 13, and 17, 1975 and have noted the contents carefully. Hansadutta is here with me now and I have given the letters to him. They have all been read and discussed by the GBC members who are present here. I want that the GBC should relieve me of this management burden and in the future, all such questions should be taken up with the local GBC member. If no satisfactory solution can be reached, then other GBC members may be consulted. The GBC can formulate proposals and submit them to me for approval. So, kindly co-operate with Hansadutta and thereby help me use my time to finish my translating work in my old age.

Whatever money is owed to the BBT, that should be paid. As far as record distribution is concerned, if you have no big books, you may temporarily continue, but give a book with each record. With record distribution alone, the result is temporary. They will hear it for some time and throw away. Book distribution is solid. Even if they do not read, simply by touching they are benefited. It is so much powerful.

You can purchase records from Hansadutta. Do not manufacture yourself. The BBT fund there has money, so your Bhagavad-gita in Dutch language can be printed with that money. I shall be anxious to see it. Anyway, work combinedly and everything will come out successful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
