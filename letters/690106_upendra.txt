====== Upendra ======

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 2, 1969 and I have carefully noted the contents. You have expressed the desire to become an Ayurvedic physician but I do not think that this proposal is very good. This science is not so important to us now because in your country there is ample facility for receiving medicines. Besides many of the herbs which are needed for Ayurvedic treatment would have to be sent here from India, and this is not very practical. This homeopathic medicine you have mentioned is not genuine and therefore is a bluff. So the first medicine which you should be concerned with is to chant Hare Krishna and to become increasingly steady in Krishna Consciousness. Study __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ and __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ and continue to help your god-brothers in developing Krishna Consciousness. So develop your preaching abilities in this way, and this will be the most successful and appreciated endeavor.

Regarding the answers which you gave to Bilas Vigrahadas, they were all correct. When you study very carefully all of the literature which is available, especially Bhagavad-gita As It Is, you will have in your grasp answers to all questions that may be put to you. Please encourage the others to read this Bhagavad-gita at least one chapter every day.

Please convey my blessings to the others at your temple. I hope that this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
