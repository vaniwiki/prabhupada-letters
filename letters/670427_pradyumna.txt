====== Pradyumna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Pradyumna dasa Brahmacari,

Please accept my blessings and I beg to thank you for your letter of the 22nd instant. I am returning herewith the Bank card duly signed by me. Pradyumna is Krishna's plenary expansion like Vasudeva, Aniruddha and Sankarsana. When Krishna appeared on the earth Pradyumna appeared as His son born of Rukmini. The immediate expansion of Krishna is Baladeva. who appeared as elder brother of Krishna and Baladeva. expands Himself further as Sankarsana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha. There are such innumerable expansions of Krishna and Pradyumna is one of them. There is no difference in potency of all these expansions.

I am so glad to learn that you had no difficulty on the border. These man made borders of land are disturbances in the Law of the Lord. All lands belong to Krishna and as servant of Krishna we have every right to enter any land but artificial man made civilization has created so many nonsense and these are the conditions of material existence. Sometimes we have to place ourselves under such conditions to make the best use of a bad bargain, but rest assured in the discharge of Krishna conscious duties Krishna will always give us His protection and we may discharge our duties unhesitatingly. I have seen in you that Krishna has special mercy upon you and utilize this mercy fully so that in this very life you can be elected as the associate of Krishna in His supreme abode Goloka Vrindaban. As you are all good souls Krishna will help you always in your business of Krishna Consciousness.

Regarding Harmonium, you can immediately send me a Money Order check $100.00 and I shall arrange for one Harmonium the best as well as for one good Mrdanga and a few pairs of Kartal.
