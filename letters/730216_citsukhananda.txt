====== Letter to: Citsukhananda ======

Caracas

My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 4th of February and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very much encouraged by your work in pioneering this movement in South America and I pray to Lord Sri Krishna that he will protect you in all your endeavors. Hanuman and yourself appear to be working so nicely as a team that I am writing to you as a team so you please discuss the points I have mentioned in Hanuman's letter and do the needful in this regard. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
