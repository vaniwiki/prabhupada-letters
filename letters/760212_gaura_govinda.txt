====== Gaura Govinda ======

Bhuvaneśvara

My dear Gaura Govinda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 8 February 1976.

It is very good that you have completed one cottage. We are trying to send one man, but in the meantime just think that Krishna is with you and there is no need of disappointment.

Now that you have your cottage, you may remain there and Krishna will help you. You have my full blessings and you try your best and you will be successful. There is no need of coming to Mayapur now. If you can come for the festival, that will be nice, but it is not compulsory.

If you are not getting reply from Gopala Krishna then you may write direct to me. I am also writing Saurabha to send you a plan.

If you publish some book in Oriyan language, that book will give you good support. So now you have an opportunity, you are there and Krishna will help. Gradually we will help. Krishna is so kind, He is always ready to help. "dadami buddhi-yogam tam yena mam upayanti te."

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
