====== Subala ======

My dear Subala,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Sept. 1, 1968, and I am so glad to learn that you have got permission to chant in the park. Previously you sent me the press clippings, and I have seen that so there was some difficulty, now by Krishna's Grace, you have got permission. Do not mind that the park is not visited by many people. But, if you chant many people will come. That will make your attempt successful. You will be glad to know that just yesterday I have arrived in San Francisco, and if you so desire, then I may go for a day or two to Santa Fe, but it will be very much expensive. Because I cannot stay more than three or four days there. Do you think that for three or four days you shall invite me, and spend so much money while you are hard up? So think over, but if you desire I can go there.

The San Francisco Sankirtana Party is doing very wonderful work, and I understand they are collecting also very nicely. And I have come here that a permanent Sankirtana Party may travel all over the country. Let me see what happens. Here the Indians who have come from the Gujarat province, they are generally devotees of Lord Krishna. They are offering their willing cooperation. Especially I have come for this purpose, how to engage them in Krishna Consciousness.

Hope this finds you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
ACB
