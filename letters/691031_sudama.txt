====== Sudama ======

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 15, 1969 and have noted the contents with much encouragement. I understand that Tamala Krishna has sent you a pair of Deities, and when you get Them please decorate the dias just to the standard of Los Angeles---at least the throne of Radha-Krishna, with good dresses, ornaments, helmets, etc. I understand that Japan is full of flowers, so everyday decorate the Deities with as many flowers as possible. Please take quotation for printing a book to the specifications as described above in my letter to Bali Mardan.

Kindly offer my blessings to your good wife, Cintamani, and I hope this will meet the both of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
