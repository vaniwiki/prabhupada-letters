====== Letter to: Bali-mardana ======

Singapore

My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24th December, 1970, and noted the contents gladly. I am very happy to know that everything is going on well in Sydney Yatra, as well as in Hong Kong and Singapore. I am very eager for you to develop your area and so far there is good promise of our successful preaching work there.

I have already notified other centers to send immediately literatures to you, and I am now printing again third edition KRSNA book, so how many you will need (KRSNA Volume I)? It is easier to ship from Tokyo direct to Singapore.

Please keep me regularly informed of your activities. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
