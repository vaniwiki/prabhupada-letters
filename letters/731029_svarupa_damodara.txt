====== Svarupa Damodara ======

Tustin, California

My dear Svarupa Damodara Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 15, 1973 and was very glad to read the contents. Regarding your book, "The Origin of Life," I have already given you the points, so you can inquire from me any intricate question in this connection and I shall try to reply. In the meantime I have received a letter from Ramananda and I am enclosing herewith. I think you can send him a ticket by arranging with Karandhara so he can immediately come there. When I come there to Los Angeles in my presence both of you can discuss threadbare all questions and put them in a satisfactory way.

The headings you have selected are nice. Now I may add one heading which may be the conclusion as follows: "Original Life is God." Because the soul is eternal (which you have discussed in point 2), the origin of life, God, is eternal.

We have to fight with all these so-called leaders, scientists, and philosophers, just like Krsna came to kill all the demons because the whole world is full of demons.

Regarding the translation work, if you can translate into German or other languages of Europe, then it will be a good help. They are very much eager to publish in other languages there.

I am glad to note that you are keeping an altar in your place. If the Dr. offers his obeisances, that goes to his devotional credit. All our processes of seeing the Deity, taking caranamrta, playing instruments, taking prasadam all go to the credit of devotional service.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
