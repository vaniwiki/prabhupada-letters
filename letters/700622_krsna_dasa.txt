====== Krsna dasa ======

Hamburg

My dear Krsna das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th June, 1970, and noted the contents which are very encouraging. I am very pleased to receive it because I was very much anxious to hear from you.

I am so glad to know that since Himavati and Hansadutta have gone to Hamburg the center has grown and improved in so many ways. This is very encouraging news that Hamburg center is becoming more and more important. Hansadutta is very anxious to open many branches in Europe and Germany. Please help and cooperate with him.

You have written to say that your Sankirtana Party is truly an ocean of transcendental knowledge and bliss. So everywhere they say Sankirtana is nice. I have received letter from London, and we are experiencing here also. So this is our life and soul. It is nice that you are visiting two university towns regularly for Sankirtana and lectures. Such news engladdens me.

Regarding your proposed marriage, Yes, I think the girl whom you have spoken about is suitable match for you. So with permission of her parents you can marry her.

I have received one newspaper cutting also which is favorable report.

I am very glad to know that His Grace Sadananda Swami has written that he plans to visit the temple this Fall. When he visits kindly give him good reception and obeisances. He is my old friend and Godbrother. Caitanya Mahaprabhu was very much respectful to the Godbrother of His Spiritual Master.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
