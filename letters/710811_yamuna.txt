====== Letter to: Yamuna ======

My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 3rd August, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far going to Africa is concerned, I have answered that point in the enclosed letter to Gurudas. It is not advisable at this time.

Frankly speaking the Deities are not as opulent as when They were being taken care of by you. So if you want to come back here and take care of Them I have no objection. But you are taking care of the Calcutta Deities, so what is the difficulty there? Does the 'democratic management' not allow you to go to the Deity room? What is the difficulty? Let me know frankly. Very soon we will have Deities installed in Mayapur also.

The sweet Deities offered you can take and we can install them in some center.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
