====== Gargamuni ======

Calcutta

My dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two recent letters.

I find in both these letters you have especially desired to call Tamala Krsna Goswami to act as GBC. But he left India particularly thinking himself not very fit for management. He has now gone for preaching work with Visnujana Maharaja and recently Karandhara met him and Tamala Krsna Maharaja is now unwilling to come to India for GBC management work. Therefore I have called Karandhara Prabhu to act as GBC in India. He has practical experience in various lines of management work. I hope he will replace Tamala Krsna Maharaja better than anyone else.

Tamala Krsna Maharaja said that you are not following the regulative principles. I do not know why you should do like that. Anyway, if there was any discrepancies in that way I hope you will rectify it and fully cooperate with Karandhara Prabhu. I am coming to India on my way to Sydney to stop for one day in Bombay on June 23rd. If you so desire you can see me in Bombay on the 23rd. Further, Brahmananda Maharaja wanted to remain in India and act as my secretary, but there is no proper man to replace him. Sometimes back you also wanted to go to Africa. If you still feel like that you can consider on the matter and I shall call Brahmananda here in India to act as my personal secretary. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
