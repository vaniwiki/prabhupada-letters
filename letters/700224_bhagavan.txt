My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22 February, 1970, with recommendation for initiating Jeanne Clausen. I have immediately chanted the beads and sent them enclosed herewith by Air Mail. Devananda will inform you of this matter by phone tonight after 9:00 p.m. So there will be no difficulty.

I have all my blessings for the girl for being married to Naranarayana, for whom I was very much anxious to get him a good wife. So I have full sanction for his marriage, and you can perform the ceremony on my behalf. I am sure under your care they will be trained as good husband and wife, following your example, and be happy in life in Krsna Consciousness.

I am enclosing the beads with flowers of my blessings for Naranarayana and Dinadayadri Dasi on the occasion of their marriage. The spiritual name of the girl is Dinadayadri Dasi. Dinadayadra is Krsna, and Dinadayadri is Radharani. So Dinadayadri Dasi means the servant of Srimati Radharani and Lord Krsna.

Hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
