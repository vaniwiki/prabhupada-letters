====== Jayatirtha ======

My dear Jayatirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 16, 1976.

Yes, it is a good plan to leave the money in my account until you need it. What is the use of keeping money unless thereis a need. It is also a good idea for you to fill in the position of GBC for South Africa until the Mayapur meeting. You are a fit man. I think you are the best experienced GBC. Yes, go to South Africa as soon as you get the opportunity to see that everything is going on there nicely.

Regarding my car, the present exchange rate is not proper. So, deposit the money from selling the car either in my account in Lloyd's Bank or Punjab National Bank. I shall pay here for purchasing a new car.

I am very pleased to see how nice the book distribution is increasing in Germany. Give those two boys who have done so nicely my thanks. Krishna will bless them. __ye yatha mam prapdayante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham__ [[books:bg:4:11|(Bg. 4.11)]]. Krsna becomes more and more pleased by seeing the increment of book distribution. Devotional service is absolute but one who preaches His message becomes very dear to Lord Krsna.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
