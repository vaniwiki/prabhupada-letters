My dear Abhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Your proposal to open centers in South America by your "floating ISKCON temple"* is very much encouraging to me, so if it is possible then certainly you have my blessings. You must make sure, though, that the management of our Baltimore temple is going on very nicely. Once that has been settled up you can make plans accordingly. Hayagriva Prabhu is the GBC representative for that part of the globe so you can consult with him and others in this connection.

I once had a dream like this; that we would have a moving temple on the water, going from town to town. So you are making that dream come true. Thank you very much. Do it nicely and maybe I will come and join you also.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*wherefrom you propose to purchase this boat?\\
P.S. The boat should be purchased new rather than used.\\
