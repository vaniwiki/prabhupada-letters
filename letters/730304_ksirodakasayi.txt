====== Letter to: Ksirodakasayi ======

My dear Ksirodakasayi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 20th February and have examined the contents with care. I am glad to hear of your successful engagements and the photographs are very nice. It is good that you have invited the other devotees for such a program. Let them come, and combine together in cooperation, not to be aloof. There are always some factions, everywhere in this world we find so many factions. But we must, in Krsna consciousness, do the needful and cooperate. So, I am very glad to see your activities and you please continue to keep up the good work.

Just yesterday I have arrived here in Calcutta and by the end of the week I expect to visit our new construction at Mayapur. Arrangements are being made for a very grand celebration on the Appearance Day of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. I hope this meets you in good health and spirits. Hare Krsna.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
