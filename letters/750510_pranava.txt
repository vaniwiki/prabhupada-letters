====== Pranava ======

Vrndavana

My dear Pranava,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much anxious to know what you have done about the land which Tahsilder and Patwari proposed to give us. I am very much anxious to know it. Please send report to our Honolulu address: 51 Coelho Way, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
