====== Jadurani ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 6, 1969, and I have noted with pleasure that you are almost done with the first five Krishna pictures which I have suggested to you. I think that you may immediately send these pictures to me in Los Angeles. So far as photographing these pictures for the book, I think that it is essential that these pictures be with bright attractive colors, so please do them in this way.

I am enclosing herewith the instructions for the next four paintings.

1. Nanda Maharaja (an old man of not less than 50 years) is observing celebration. Many cowherd boys are coming with milk and curd on a balancing stick on their backs (see enclosed picture). Nanda Maharaja, who is the chief amongst the cowherd men, is giving them presentations of cloth, ornaments, fruits, etc., and there is feasting going on. Some of them are enjoying by throwing butter upon their friend's bodies.

2. The demonic Putana Witch has come to Yasoda looking just like a very nice young woman, and congratulating Yasoda for her beautiful child. She said to Yasoda "You have such nice baby, kindly let me hold Him." Yasoda was very simple and allowed this, but when Krishna sucked the witch's breast the demon showed her true gigantic form which was actually miles long and she died. In the picture, Krishna is playing on the breast of this gigantic dead demon.

3. Krishna was lying underneath a cart which was actually a demon who had taken the shape of a cart so Krishna would not suspect danger. Krishna was lying underneath the cart, but then He kicked it while playing, and a great giant came out and died.

4. One asura Trinavarta whirlwind took Baby Krishna into the sky and was fighting with Him. The idea was to take Krishna into the sky and drop Him. But once in the sky, Krishna fought with the whirlwind, and the demon fell down dead while Krishna was lying happily on the ground. Yasoda was praying in thanks that "God has saved my Boy."

Regarding your question about placing an effulgence around Krishna's head in all of these pictures, yes this should be done. I hope to be receiving the previous paintings you have done soon. Kindly convey my blessings to all others at Boston temple.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
