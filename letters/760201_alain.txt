My dear Alain,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your French letter. Your feelings are very nice. Please continue chanting Hare Krishna, study my books, and follow faithfully the four regulative principles. Your path Back to Godhead will be assured.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
