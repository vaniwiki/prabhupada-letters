====== Jayapataka ======

Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 20th July, 1970, and noted the contents., But it is the old story. Anyway, I am hoping against hope that very soon we shall have a place either at Calcutta or at Mayapur.

Kindly keep me informed of your activities at least twice in a week, otherwise I become very much anxious and due to my blood pressure sometimes do not eat, do not sleep. I am just trying to organize a worldwide movement not for any personal ambition but to execute superior orders, and by the grace of Krsna we are getting good encouragement. So I request my students to cooperate fully.

As soon as I hear from you that we have got some place, immediately I shall go to India for a change, with two Sannyasis. Recently I have given Sannyas order of life to six Brahmacaris. They have been sent in different parts of the country for preaching work and two of them might to with me to join you. So immediately we require a place of our own,.

I am very glad that Acyutananda's doing nice preaching work. Offer my blessings to him and I wish to hear from him also along with your next letter.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
