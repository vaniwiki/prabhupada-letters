====== Mukunda ======

<card class="letter">
San Francisco

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter dated July 14, 1968, with enclosure. It is very nice. I am already informed about your Kirtana activities in San Francisco and its success. I think Krishna is dictating us to adopt this method for propagating the Sankirtana movement all over the different cities, towns and villages on the surface of the globe, because that was the prediction of Lord Caitanya. The exact words in Bengali poetry are as follows: "Prithi vite acche yata nagaradi gram. Sarvatra pracara haibe more nama."

I have already asked Hansadutta to open correspondence with you. Please do expedite the arrangement for London Yatra by mutual correspondence. Here in Montreal there is postal strike. So I am posting this letter in Buffalo where one boy is going tomorrow morning. I think unless there is very important business you can suspend correspondence to Montreal address. My visa is up to 3rd of September 1968, and if by that time my London yatra is not completed, then I will have to extend the visa period. I think you should start for London as early as possible. The plan already made by you is agreed by me. So you can go ahead with the plan. Our only plan should be henceforward to spread the Sankirtana activities and sell our publications. Publication of Back To Godhead is entrusted to Rayarama, and for publication of books, Brahmananda is entrusted. For business Gargamuni is entrusted. So let us combinedly execute the Krishna Consciousness movement in full swing.

Hoping you are all well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
