====== Vamanadeva ======

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated November 16, 1969, and thank you very much for your opening a branch at St. Louis so promptly. Now both you and your wife are trained how to arrange for maintaining a temple and center. Please do it nicely. The beginning is sounding so hopeful that I am sure very soon your center will be one of the first class preaching places of our society. Of course not immediately, but you will have another responsibility to send me something for my maintenance as the others are sending. There is no pressure, but when you find convenient, you can also help in that way. Please keep me informed about your progressive march in St. Louis.

Kindly offer my blessings in Indira Dasi. I hope this will meet you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
