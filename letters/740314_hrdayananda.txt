====== Hrdayananda ======

Dear Hrdayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I was pleased to appoint you as GBC of South America in the hope that you will organize the printing and distribution of my literature there, on the scale of the U.S. and European Zones. I have been informed there is a very good chance for spreading Krishna Consciousness in South America.

Just as Hansadutta and Bhagavan have gone to foreign countries and arranged for a solid program of translation, printing and distribution of my books by sankirtana party, so you will also find the devotees in South America willing to help you in this noble project which is for the benediction of the suffering humanity. My own Guru Maharaja stressed the printing and distribution of literature even over gorgeous temple construction, and I also was printing even before I have big temples in the U.S. So you may follow the footsteps of the previous acaryas, while always strictly following the regulative principles for spiritual strength.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
