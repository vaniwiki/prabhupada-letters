Digambar Singh Chowdhury

My dear Digambar Singh:

Please accept my blessings. Since I have left India I am touring so many places. Now I am in Johannesburg and on the 25th of October I am going to Nairobi. Regarding our farming scheme, it is almost settled that we shall get some land. Now we have to organize carefully. In this respect, I am counting upon your good help. On my return to India I wish to hold immediately one meeting of Krisans or agriculturist society. The idea is that the land is there and Krisans may be engaged to grow food both for men and for the animals, namely the cows. The cow should be maintained very healthy so that they can give sufficient good milk. The Krisans shall live comfortably in the cottages. They should produce their food, their milk, and their cloth. Everything produced will be used by themselves. If there is any excess production then the question of trade will arise. That we shall see later on. All the products produced will belong to Krishna-Balarama. Everyday at least thrice, all the Krisans meet in the local temple of Krishna-Balarama, chant Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, and take prasadam. In this way they should live peacefully locally without going outside for their livelihood. This is the general program.

Now we have to itemize so that things may go on very nicely. So I am returning to India by the end of this month. Please arrange to hold a meeting successfully for this purpose. I do not know your address therefore I am forwarding this letter through Bhaktaji Sriman Visvambhara Dayala Agarwal. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
