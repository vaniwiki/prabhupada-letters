Dear Mahadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 17, and I have noted the contents.

Syamasundara has invited me to go to London and if he sends tickets as promised then I am going by the first week of May. I shall personally study the situation as mentioned by you and make my judgement personally. At that time I shall consult with Syamasundara. But why is your presence necessary? As a devotee you should be satisfied serving the Lord anywhere. Why are you so anxious to return to London? Therefore I shall request you not to start yourself in that way until I personally go there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
