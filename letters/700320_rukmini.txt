====== Letter to: Rukmini ======

Boston

My dear Rukmini,

Please accept my blessings. Very, very much thanks for your laddus. They are very, very tasteful, and we have eaten with great relish. Still they are in stock, and I shall go on eating.

Deity worship means to be very, very clean. You should try to bathe twice daily. The Deities should never be approached without having bathed first and changed to clean cloths after passing stool, etc. Keep teeth brushed after each meal, fingernails clean and trim. Be sure that your hands are clean before touching anything on the altar or the Deities. And cleanse the Deity room, altar and floor daily thoroughly. Shine the various Aratrik paraphernalia after Aratrik. This is described in the booklet for pujaris written by Silavati Dasi. The idea is summit cleanliness---that will satisfy Krsna.

Regarding your dream, it is a great blessing to you that Krsna warned you. So you should never be negligent. Always be careful, then in due course you will feel the Bhava.

Please offer my blessings to your good husband, Bharadraja. I hope both of you are in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
