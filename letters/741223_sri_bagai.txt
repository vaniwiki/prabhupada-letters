Dear Sri Bagai:

Please accept my greetings and the blessings of Lord Caitanya.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15-12-74 and am sending herewith your Life Membership Card signed by me. I am also sending herewith a letter addressed to all of my temple Presidents to help you in every respect and to provide you boarding and lodging free of charge.

I have instructed my in-charge of my Bombay Headquarters to send you the literature and other items you have requested as far as possible, and you should be hearing from me shortly.

Meanwhile, I hope that you enjoy your visit in the Temples and that we may meet sometime to discuss.

I hope this letter will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
