====== Letter to: Jayatirtha, Bhagavan ======

Dear Jayatirtha and Bhagavan prabhus,

Please accept my blessings. I am very satisfied with the work Harikesa Swami is doing there in Germany and Eastern Europe, therefore in order to encourage him and give him facility to rectify the situation in Germany, I have appointed him as acting GBC/BBT until the Mayapur meeting. You GBC men should please help him in his efforts to win the case there as this case will decide the future of our movement there in Europe.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

ACBS/jda
