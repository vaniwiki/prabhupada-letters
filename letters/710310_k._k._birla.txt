Dear Sri Birlaji,

Please accept my greetings. From your previous letters it is understood that you know the activities of my Society in Europe and America. Sometimes when you were in New York you saw our Sankirtana Party on the Fifth Avenue.

We have come from America and Europe with forty disciples, mostly American, and we wanted to stay in the Birla Guest House at Mayapur during the Birthday Anniversary of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Unfortunately, Sri Bhakti Vilas Tirtha did not allow us to stay at the Birla Guest House and the copy of the letter from him is enclosed herewith.

As a matter of fact, I wish to stay there (at Mayapur) for a few days with my disciples who have come from Europe and America and you may kindly ask Sri Bhakti Vilas Tirtha to do the needful in this connection.

Thanking you in anticipation for an early reply.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
