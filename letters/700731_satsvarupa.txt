My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th July, 1970 regarding the manuscript.

I understand that all the pictures of KRSNA, Vol. II, are not prepared, so I shall request you to complete these pictures as soon as possible. There is no hurry because now I am going with a small Sankirtana Party to the Eastern countries. I wish to remain in Japan at least for two months. Therefore if you send me the complete manuscript and pictures, then I can personally get the book, Second Volume, printed in my presence.

I have duly received the press meeting report of July 25th, signed by you, Uddhava, Advaita, Brahmananda Swami, and Gargamuni Swami. It has given me much pleasure, so I shall be more pleased when they are done according to the writings.

Regarding Bhagavad-gita, enlarged edition, the picture approved by me to Jadurani is all right. I am glad to learn that it is being serialized. Regarding Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto, I am glad that manuscript is also being composed. Srimad-Bhagavatam, Second Canto, improper title pages being rectified is good news. Please keep me informed about the progress of those manuscripts.

Our life is very short. The Krsna consciousness movement is not meant for fulfilling one's personal ambition, but it is a serious movement for the whole world. I am therefore going to the Eastern hemisphere, beginning from Japan. We are going four in a party and all of us are Sannyasis. In this old age I am going with this party just to set an example to my disciples who have taken recently the Sannyas order. I think Brahmananda Swami, Gargamuni Swami, Visnujana Swami, Kirtanananda Swami and Subala Swami, all of them, two in a party assisted by other Brahmacaris should form separate Sankirtana Parties and travel all over Europe, America and Canada.

Now we want very many Swamis to take up this job. The Grhasthas are to take care of the Temples as well as the general management. I have already formed the Governing Body Commission and your good name is also in the Board. There is no time for creating a crack in our solid formation of Krsna Consciousness Society. Take it now with great responsibility and everyone of you may serve jointly for Krsna's satisfaction. That is my request to you all.

I think you may reply this letter to me care of ISKCON, Tokyo, Japan.

Whatever mistakes that have been done in the past may be rectified. That is my request.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
