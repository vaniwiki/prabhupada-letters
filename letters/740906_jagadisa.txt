====== Letter to: Jagadisa ======

Toronto

My dear Jagadisa das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. So you may remain wherever you may be peaceful. You may resume your GBC duties as secretary for the Central U.S.A. Zone. GBC means that one must be ideal Vaisnava. That means there must be strict observance in following all the rules and regulations. This is your main responsibility, and then to see that all others are following strictly. Then everything will be all right.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
