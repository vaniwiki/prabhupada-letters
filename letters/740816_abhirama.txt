====== Abhirama ======

Coconut Grove, Florida

My dear Abhirama das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 15, 1974 and have noted the contents. I have accepted the students upon your recommendation as my initiated disciples. Their spiritual names are as follows:

David Milo Cramer---Dhruva das

Ernest Czwal---Drsta das

Thomas Gribble---Takrahari

John Paul Gribble---Jagatsakha

Ron Jermakakian---Rajakari

Joseph Rizzo---Ragaputra

Jerome Schein---Srisa

Joseph Cyril Streb---Sarvopama

Marsha Bryant---Manini

Aurora Gribble---Akancani

Farnie Spottswood---Srutirupa devi dasi

Donna Tonkinson---Drsya

John Jill---Jambavan

As you have suggested, you may hold a fire sacrifice and the beads may be chanted upon by Rupanuga Prabhu. You should impress upon the new disciples that they are taking vows before Radha and Krsna, the spiritual master, and the Vaisnavas. They must always chant at least 16 rounds daily and avoid the four sinful activities.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
