====== Gopala Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated September 25th, 1969 and I have noted the contents. I am sorry to learn that Dayala Nitai has temporarily left our association, and if in his absence you can take charge of printing French edition of __Back To Godhead,__ that is nice. But the thing is it must be regularly published every month. Now some devotees have gone to Paris. They are not as yet established, but the idea is that we should eventually publish our French edition from Paris, as the German edition is being published from Hamburg. But so long it is not begun there, you can take charge of publishing from Montreal, as it was being done. Janardana has not come here to see me at London. I do not know if he has already gone to Paris, because I have not received any letter from him either.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
