====== Hillel Ben-Ami ======

Washington D.C.

Dear Hillel Ben-Ami,

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, undated, and I have noted the contents very carefully. Thank you very much for your kind sentiments. Now try and understand our philosophy very carefully by reading all of our books, such as __Bhagavad-gita As It Is, Srimad-Bhagavatam, Nectar of Devotion, Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ and there are so many others. In addition, please follow the regulative principles very rigidly, such as chanting daily 16 rounds on the beads, attending classes, getting up for mangala aratrika. These regulative principles will make us very strong in Krsna Consciousness and very rapidly we can advance in this way. So under the direction of the senior devotees there try and become fixed in your devotional service to the Lord, Sri Krsna, and this will certainly bring complete satisfaction to you and make you eligible for going back to home, back to Godhead, in this very lifetime.

Hoping this finds you well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
