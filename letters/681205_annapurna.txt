====== Letter to: Annapurna ======

London

My dear Annapurna,

After long time, please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Oct. 30, which has reached me after travelling over the whole world. It was addressed to Montreal, sent to Hollywood Blvd., then to Orange Drive and finally it has come to me. So it has taken so long time and I am very glad to learn that you are now in your father's country and feeling very nice. Mukunda and all the other devotees are trying their best to start a temple in London and a temple is already there by Krishna's Grace. The landlord has offered them the place free of rent until the house is disposed of so I think that they should try to influence the landlord to donate the building for our great cause. At least he should let us conduct our business there for the benefit of all of mankind. It is understood that the landlord belongs to the hippie group and he has purchased the house for hippie propaganda but now wishes to sell the house and property. If some concessional rate is offered then we can also try to purchase the property. So consult with your godbrothers and Gurudasa is the best man to tackle with this landlord and appeal to him to donate this house free for this great cause of spreading Krishna Consciousness. So again I thank you for your nice letter and the sentiments expressed therein and please keep me informed as to your well-being.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
