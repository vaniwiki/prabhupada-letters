====== Dinatarini dasi ======

My dear Dinatarini dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 11, 1972, and I have appreciated very much your kind sentiments. Yes, I am very pleased to see how our children in Dallas school are making such nice advancement in Krishna Consciousness happy life. Small children are just like animals and they have to be t rained how to obey, otherwise they will be simply spoiled. But the art is how to apply authority and discipline so they will enjoy it and not reject, and I think you all instructors are learning yourselves that art more and more, and this pleases me very much.

I am glad to hear that the worship of deities is improving daily and Sri Sri Radha and Krishna are appearing happier in their new Dallas home. Why don't you send me some photos, how they are looking now?

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
