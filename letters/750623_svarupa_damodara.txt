====== Svarupa Damodara ======

Atlanta

My dear Svarupa Damodara dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 20, 1975 with enclosures, and I thank you very much for it. It is very good that you are progressing with the book proving scientifically that Lord Sri Krishna is the origin of life. Yes, do it slowly but surely. It is important work for our preaching mission.

As you say you are thinking of retiring from the university, yes, as you are not a family man, you can do it for better service to the Lord. Regarding Manipur, you said that there is a Govinda temple there and that they are willing to hand over the management. I think somebody came to see me in India about it, but I don't exactly remember the name. The best thing will be for you to retire and take charge of such a noble project.

Regarding your question about the jiva soul in the heart and the jiva soul within the cells, they are separate. Both are jiva atmas, but a particular jiva belongs to a particular body. There is the jiva in this body, but there are also jivas within the cells. Just like I am living within this apartment, but does it mean that no other living entity can live here. There are so many ants, flies, bugs, they are also living within the apartment. Even in my stool there are thousands of living entities.

Your second question is not very clear what you want to ask, but the fact is that each and every living entity is covered by two kinds of bodies, one subtle and one gross. So the subtle body causes the living entity to take another gross body. We have got experience that in dreaming the gross body is inactive while the subtle body is continuing activities; and again in deep sleep the subtle body is continuing activities. The living entity after being carried by the subtle body to another gross body, it sometimes remains in deep sleep in the womb of the mother. Then gradually the subtle body begins to act within another gross body. When this gross body is fully developed befitting to come out of the mother's body, that is called another birth. Again he changes to another gross body imperceptibly. Just like in the film thousands of pictures are moved imperceptibly. It looks that the body in the picture is moving, but the audience cannot understand that there are so many pictures in the spool. They think that the picture is moving. Similarly every second every moment we are changing the body.

Those who are not sober cannot understand how the spirit soul is changing from one body to another. Krsna therefore says that this change of body can be appreciated only by the __dhiras. dhiras tatra na muhyati__ [[books:bg:2:13|(Bg. 2.13)]]. While those who are not dhiras cannot understand how the soul is changing from one body to another. There are two kind of men, __dhira__ and __adhira.__ The modern education is producing only the __adhira__ class who are neither sober or educated. Therefore the majority of the population cannot understand how the soul is transmigrating from one body to another. They are only interested in wine and woman under the impression of the bodily concept of life. Therefore out of so many scientists in this country only you and the few others are understanding the importance of this subject matter. manusyanam sahasresu [[books:bg:7:3|(Bg. 7.3)]]. So please work very hard, following our rules and regulations and you will always remain in the fire of Krsna consciousness.

Regarding your asking me to come to Atlanta, it may be possible. That I shall see.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
