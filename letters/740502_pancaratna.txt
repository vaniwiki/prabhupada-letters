My dear Pancaratna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter and packet of information including prospectus for getting engagements in schools and colleges.

Your list of achievements by college course, Yoga club and programs in general is very impressive, particularly that you have a regular four credit college course at Fordham University wherein the students are required to read some of my books. The idea of employing an interested professor and making him the co-teacher seems to be a major break-through in our attempts to teach at the colleges. I am very happy about this. Now as you have described the process to me, make a newsletter and distribute this information to all the centers, so they can try to get the assistance of a college professor and gain accredited courses. The world is most sorely in need of education in Krsna Consciousness, but due to the ignorance of the age they are not interested in knowledge of the self. So if by labeling the bottle in some way more to attract them we are still able to teach Krsna Consciousness, let us do it. Krsna has given you good intelligence because of your sincerity; as he sees we are humble and sincere about propagating His message He will give us more and more opportunity.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
