====== Letter to: Dhananjaya ======

Vrindaban

My dear Dhananjaya das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated June 21st and June 29th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your printing in Hindi in Mathura is a good idea. Do it in consultation with Gopala Krishna Prabhu. So you send me the translation and after seeing it, I shall approve.

Regarding the land, you purchase immediately. I have already advised the bank.

Regarding Nitai, he is now travelling with me for some immediate editing work. Afterwards you can consult with Ramesvara what will be his program.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
