London

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22nd February, 1971 and have noted the contents. Presently I am in Bombay and will be here until 4th April. I am very sorry to inform you that the London management is not going on nicely. I have received so many unfavorable reports and the most astonishing report is that our small van which you had purchased in my presence has been taken away by the proprietor on account of payments not being made properly. So we have lost all the money that we have already paid. But never mind; that is past. Now, better late than never, try to establish the position of the London temple as it was before. I have confidence that you can do it nicely so go on and let me know what progress you are making.

Also I have received the five letters requesting initiation. Richard Prime and Jim Counsilman have already been initiated and they should have received their beads duly chanted on by now. Also please thank Milan, Phillip, and Anna for their kind letters. From Bombay I shall most probably be stopping in London on my way back to U.S.A. and at that time can initiate them personally.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
