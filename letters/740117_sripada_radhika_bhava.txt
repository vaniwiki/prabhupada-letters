====== Sripada Radhika Bhava ======

<card class="letter">
Sripada Radhika Bhava\\
c/o Imli Tala, Vrindaban

With humble obeisances at the lotus feet of the devotee, Sripada Radhika Bhava, please accept my humble obeisances. At the moment I am in Hawaii Island. I am requesting you that after our Navadvipa parikrama about two hundred to three hundred European devotees will go to Vrndavana for parikrama. That's why Sriman Guru das is going to see you with this letter. Kindly introduce Guru das to the son of our panda (the guide for the pilgrim) whom you have recently given Rs. 100 on my behalf. If that panda goes with them and shows them Govardhana and other places then I will be very much grateful. Please accept my humble obeisances and convey my humble obeisances to Sripada Shar Maharaja. I will go to India soon.

Yours,

Sri Bhaktivedanta Swami
