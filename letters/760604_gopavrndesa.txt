My dear Gopavrndesa dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your offering of the sanskrit verse which you composed for me and I thank you very much. Now I am encouraging my young disciples to all try to learn at least one Indian language, like Hindi or Bengali. At least those who have the propensity can become proficient in some language, especially Hindi, and then you will be able to preach in India in the native language. It will be very effective.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
