My dear Sushil K. Arora,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 11, 1975 with enclosed check for 250 rupees. I thank you very much for it. I am glad to know that you have appreciated our movement and are taking active interest. I very much enjoyed my stay in Toronto and I hope that everyone there, all the devotees, especially amongst the Indian community, will co-operate to spread our movement in Toronto and establish a very nice temple.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
