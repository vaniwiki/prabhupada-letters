My Dear Jayadharma,

Please accept My blessings.

I am in due receipt of your kind letter and sweater gift to me and I thank you very much. Yes, the process is to give the very best to the Spiritual Master no matter what the cost. Just like you'll recall in the story of Krishna and Sudama at the Gurukula of their Spiritual Master, because they risked their life to carry out the order of their Guru Maharaj, they were blessed by him to gain eternal Knowledge. So in the same way keep trying to offer Krishna your very best and all blessings will be bestowed on you.

I hope this letter meets you in the best of Health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
