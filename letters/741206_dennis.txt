My dear Dennis:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 22, 1974 and have noted the contents. So regarding the situation that if you leave your wife and your son, she will be broken hearted, therefore I asked you to stay. It is better for you to remain with your wife and son and chant Hare Krishna as much as possible, and Krishna will personally give you direction. It may be that Krishna will make your wife agreeable to your line of action. And if your wife agrees, and your son he is already doing, that will make your life very happy in Krishna consciousness.

The best policy is to chant Hare Krishna all together husband, wife, and son at least a half hour daily. If your wife joins with you in chanting, then the whole problem will be solved.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
