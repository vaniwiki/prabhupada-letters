====== Shaktimati ======

Carlgary, Canada

My dear Shaktimati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your Hindi letter dated 18/11/76.

You can open a center along with all the members of your family. Just make sure to follow all the regulative principles. Wherever you stay just chant the Holy Name.

At present I'm in Bombay. In a couple of days I am going to Bhuvaneśvara, then probably to Kumbha Mela and then to Mayapur.

So, open a center now and when I get an opportunity I will come.

Hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
