My Dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5th August, 1970.

Regarding Janmastami arrangement, it is going on nicely-that is very encouraging. We have started New Vrndavana in America and it must be finished in the American way. In Vrndavana there are so many temples, they say 5,000, or in Vrndavana every home, every cottage, is a temple. As far as possible try to develop New Vrndavana on this standard. In the coming meeting of Janmastami amongst other business you must have a resolution how to finish the development of New Vrndavana in the right sense of the term. At the same time, please make a very nice scheme to purge out the non-Vrndavana spirit that entered in our Society.

I have received telegram from Jayapataka. They have secured a nice place for accommodating at least 30 men. But we are going there only six on the 29th of this month. So settle up in the next meeting of GBC to send at least another 20 men, some of them may be women, also to India without delay. I have got a very nice idea this time to capture the communistic people for spreading Krsna Consciousness Movement. I do not know how far it will be successful, but I wish that all other major movements in the world may be cut down and only the Krsna Consciousness Movement be taken up in all seriousness.

Krsna says in the Bhagavad-Gita to give up all other engagements and take to Krsna only. So Krsna Consciousness Movement being non-different from Krsna we have to try our best to make this Movement predominant all over the world curbing down all others.

You are thinking of money, how to go to India, but I think it is not a problem. Where there is a will there is a way. If Krsna wants your service in India there will be no scarcity of money -He will supply you. Let me first of all go there and I shall write you again what to do next. In the meantime make the New Vrndavana meetings very successful and send me a report at the following address: ISKCON; 37/1 Hindustan Road; Ballyganj; Calcutta-29.

Offer my blessings to Srimati Shama Dasi, all-blissful Samba, and all other devotees in New Vrndavana. I thank you very much for your anxiety when I shall come back and I wish I shall come back as soon as possible. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
