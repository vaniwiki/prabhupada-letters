====== Madhukantha ======

Los Angeles

My dear Madhukantha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2nd August, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far as your getting yourself married, I have no objection provided you agree to some points. First of all you must promise that you will not separate under any circumstances. This marriage is serious business and not to be taken lightly. There is no question of separation in Krishna Conscious marriages. Therefore I am asking all those who want to be married that they sign one paper promising that there will be no separation. Karandhara Prabhu can be consulted in this connection and he should draw up such document in the manner Rupanuga has done in N.Y. Then, if you are feeling able to handle the responsibilities of grhastha life, you can go ahead with the ceremony immediately and with my blessings.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
