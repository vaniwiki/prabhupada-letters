====== Pradyumna ======

My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 22, 1969 with enclosures, and I have noted the contents. So far as __devanagari__ character is concerned, you can correspond with Remington Typewriter Company. In India, in most of the government offices __devanagari__ type is used for correspondence, and Remington Typewriter Company has got contract with the government to supply the typewriters. So I am sure they can supply you with a __devanagari__ typewriter. I am expecting this printing of our literature, especially __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ with __devanagari__ type and diacritic transliteration will be completely entrusted to you. So you cannot type everything from the IBM. That is not possible. In the IBM machine you shall do the English work and the diacritic transliteration work. So far as the __devanagari__ type is concerned, you have to do it with the help of another machine, and either you will have to paste on the lines or adopt some other device so that they can be joined. That shall be the process. But if we publish our __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ exactly in the way I have already begun it, it will be a unique contribution. The scholars only require diacritic marks. Then it is all right. That should be very correct and standard. If there is __devanagari__ character it is still better. Otherwise, correct transliterations will do. So you think over this matter seriously and train your wife for composing, and help her to the best possible way.

I am glad that you are also holding a Rathayatra Festival. I am going tomorrow to San Francisco to participate in the same Rathayatra Festival there. We received report from New York that they have collected last week $1,000, and they are selling at a rate of 200 copies of __BTG__ daily, on weekends especially. I have received report also that they are selling 60-70 copies daily in Boston and collecting $50 or $60 on the average. Your Columbus center is very nice, and the place you have got is a very suitable place. So you try to organize your center very nicely. What did you do about the mrdanga supplier from Bombay as you were discussing it with Mr. Vora?

The beads referred to in your letter have not yet arrived. As you recommend this boy, Jim, so highly, surely I shall chant on them and send back to him. Last night we initiated here one dozen new devotees, both boys and girls, and they appear to be very, very nice. Last week also I initiated about seven devotees and installed the Radha-Krishna Murtis on the 16th of July. So make propaganda nicely amongst the student community, and there is very good chance of your center being developed as one of the important centers of our society.

Please offer my blessings to Arundhati. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
