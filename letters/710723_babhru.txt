====== Babhru ======

439 HENRY STREET, BROOKLYN, N.Y. 11231 – Tel.: 596-9658

My dear Babhru (William),

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very kind letter dated 19th July, and you will be glad to know that I have gladly accepted you as my duly initiated disciple. Your beads have been duly chanted on by me and they are enclosed herewith. Your spiritual name is Babhru Das Brahmachary. Babhru was a great personality in the Yadu dynasty.

Goursundar Prabhu informs me that you are head Tulasi gardner at New Nabadwipa. Now ‘Krishna Tulasi’ is there also. You surely must be a great devotee. Tulasi devi is growing so profusely there and that is surely to your credit. So continue with this valuable service and become fixed up in Krishna consciousness. Chant all your 16 rounds faithfully, study all our literatures and go for street San Kirtan as much as possible. And by the grace of Srimati Tulasi Devi surely you will make rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
