====== Sudama ======

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 11th September, and have noted the contents. My instruction to you is that you stick to Japan. Even by the present process when the visas are finished, still you can go to some neighboring country like Korea or Hong Kong or Sydney or India or wherever and then again come back to Japan. And instead of asking for missionary visas the others can follow the same process. They can go for some time and exchange and in this way Japan center can be maintained. Advise Bhanu in the same way also. So we have to somehow or other push on and Krishna will give us a chance. For yourself also you can try and take a visa as a teacher and some of your students may demand your presence. We have to play some tricks for Krishna's sake. What can be done?

So far your hiring a professional translator, unless you can understand Japanese language, how this is possible? The professional translator may translate wrongly; how you will detect it? Best thing is if Bhanu and yourself do the translating.

One thing is that I am expecting a quotation from Dai Nippon for Bhagavad-gita, enlarged edition as well as a quotation for a stamp sheet of which I sent Mr. Ugata a sample, but as of yet I have not received them. Please see Mr. Ugata and if possible send the quotations to me immediately.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
