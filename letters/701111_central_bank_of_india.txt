Dear Sir;

On October 28th, 1970 I had to advise you to transfer by mail Rs. 1,728 to your Gwalia Tank Branch in Bombay and the copy of the advice is sent herewith.

The money was immediately deposited with your cashier and I possess the receipt slip, but here in Bombay your Gwalia Tank Branch says that they have not received the money.

Kindly immediately inform me what is the fate of the money.

An early reply will much oblige me.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
