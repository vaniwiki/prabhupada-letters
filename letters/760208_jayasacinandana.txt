Los Angeles

My dear Jayasacinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 22, 1976, and I have noted the contents. Thank you very much for your nice translation of Markine Bhagavata-dharma. It is well appreciated. I think it can be included in the front of the new printing of the song book, and it can be sung in kirtana like the other songs of Bhaktivinode Thakura. I have included a few corrections below which can be noted. The other prayer can be called Prayer to the Lotus Feet of Krsna, and I will be sending comments on that shortly.\\
Corrections:\\
Verse 2: synonyms: __ei__---in this __ugra-sthane__---terrible place

translation: . . . to this terrible place.\\
Verse 3: synonyms: __prasanna__---is happy or jubilant\\
Verse 5: transliteration: __bujhale__

synonyms: __bujhale nija-vasa__---under your controlling power\\
Verse 8: synonyms: __kane__---by aural reception

__bara bara__---again and again\\
Verse 9: translation: accumulated in the core of the heart\\
Verse 15: synonyms: __dhara__---determination

translation: . . . in my mind there is only great determination

Hoping this meets you well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
