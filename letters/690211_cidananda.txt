====== Cidananda ======

My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of February 5, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. It is understood that you and Mulgi ba have been collecting for the new temple, but I do not know who is keeping account of this money. How much is there at present in this fund? Where is this fund being kept? Please inform me on these matters.

Regarding your efforts for securing advertisements for __Back To Godhead,__ the best thing would be if we could stop these advertisements, but the difficulty is that without advertisements it would be very difficult to continue this magazine. So, under the circumstances, if you and other devotees can secure at least $100 per month for __Back To Godhead,__ then it will not be necessary for you in San Francisco to obtain money by getting advertisements. Please consider on this point and let me know your ideas. So far as the Asian Student Foundation, I do not think you should give them free of charge 150 copies of __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__

I hope that by now you are fully recovered in health, and I shall await your letter with interest. Please convey my blessings to the others in your temple.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
