My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far your travelling throughout the south, particularly Atlanta center, I have no objection. Just so long there is someone competent to look after Boston temple. If you think Harer Nama can manage all right, that is nice.

Yes, you should try and develop a headquarters there in the Southern zone, just like L.A. in the West or N.Y. in the East. That will be very nice. I have just received one letter from Mohanananda in Dallas and he wants to purchase a very large property very much suitable for our purpose. He also proposes to have an accredited school there for the society children. All this he wants to develop in conjunction with the country asrama there. He is very enthusiastic for it. So you should encourage him and if his plans are feasible then perhaps Dallas would be the most suitable headquarters for the Southern zone. So you can discuss the matter with Mohanananda, Karandhara and the others and do the needful.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
