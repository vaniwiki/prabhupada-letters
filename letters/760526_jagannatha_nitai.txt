====== Letter to: Jagannatha, Nitai ======

Vrindaban

My dear Jagannatha das and Nitai das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received a report that you are not working on my books. Why you have stopped editing my books? So what are you doing with my books? You have stopped editing, but what is your occupation now?

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
