====== Giriraja ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. We have arrived in New York on the fifth bypassing London for now because the new place is not yet ready. I will be staying here until about the 17th, then go to New Vrndavana for a few days and then to Los Angeles.

Please let me know immediately how the Chhanganlal case has come out. I hope that by now you have received my letter of April 3, 1973 and have taken appropriate steps to secure the Juhu land.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
