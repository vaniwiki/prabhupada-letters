====== Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings & convey the same to Pradyumna & others. I missed your telephone call but I understand that your center is doing well. When I go to New York I shall go to Boston. I understand that Damodara has gone to N.Y. with manuscript of Teachings of Lord Caitanya. I thank you for your sincere service. I pray Krishna for your more & more improvement in Krishna Consciousness.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
