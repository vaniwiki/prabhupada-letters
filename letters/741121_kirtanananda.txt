====== Kirtanananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 18th, 1974, with your recommendations for first and second initiations. The following are those who I have accepted as my disciples and they are to be given the Hare Nama Initiation. Their names are as follows. Jerry Boy---Janakisa Dasa. Bill Jones---Bimbadhara Dasa. Cris Hall---Krpamaya Dasa.

So far these second initiations are concerned, I accept the following as duly initiated twice born Brahmans. Yajnabhuk Dasa. Lalitasakhi Devi Dasi. Rasa-lila Devi Dasi.

The appropriate sacred thread and mantra sheets are enclosed. You can chant on the beads and hold a fire sacrifice and the Gayatri Mantra can be listened to through the right ear from my tape recording.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
