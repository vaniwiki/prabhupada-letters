====== Karandhara ======

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1st March, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I understand that you have become a debtor to Dai Nippon for $52,000. This is not good. We must keep our credit. They have given us all facilities, and if you don't keep our credit with them, that is not good. So consider it a heavy debt. I have just sent them a check for $20,000. The forwarding copy of the letter is enclosed herein, which will speak for itself.

Now to make a solution to the problem the following formula should be followed: Print 200,000 BTGs without fail. The cost of this printing will be $14,000. Each center must collect at least 25 cents for each copy as donation, if not more. Any man will be able to pay 25 cents; it is not difficult. So by collecting 25 cents per copy is $50,000, expenditure is $14,000, and so there is a clear profit of $36,000. Out of that $5,000 per month may be paid towards the old debt. So still there is $31,000, so if this is divided proportionately for each temple, where is the question of poverty? This means that the management has not been done properly. Henceforward this policy should be followed. Collect $50,000, pay $14,000, leaving $36,000 profit. Pay the old debt of $5,000 and divide the remaining $31,000 amongst the temples.

Now as I am forwarding $20,000, the first four months at the rate of $5,000 may be paid to me. After this is paid, regularly $5,000 may be paid to Dai Nippon for their old debts. Manage like this and everything will be all right. So far Indian money, I paid for Isopanisad, NOD, KRSNA book, and some of the chapter-wise Srimad-Bhagavatam. So there was about 10,000 NOD, worth about $40,000, Isopanisad---$5,000, TLC---$3,000 and KRSNA book at $80,000. The total price for all these I have paid. These books were in the stock worth $155,000. You have not paid Dai Nippon even $50,000, so where is the money? The whole thing is that management is not being done properly.

So far as moving the accounting department to N.Y., that is all right, but first of all let the certified accountant there do and then when the GBC sees that he is doing nicely, then you can hand over the account. Yes, you may give the donors an honorable mention page in __Bhagavad-gita.__

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
