====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated October 17, and October 23, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. Enclosed is the letter for you to hand over to the draft lawyer. I am pleased to note that there is interest in having our Sankirtana Party perform in various public engagements. The same thing is going on here, and they have been invited to such places as Amsterdam and Germany. So if you can also do this, it is nice. But do not change our principles. Practicing is already done by kirtana. It is not required for us to become artists. Our main point is service to Krishna, not to please an audience. We shall not divert our attention too much to adjustment of musical sounds. People should not misunderstood that we are a band of musical artists. They must know that we are devotees of Krishna. Our devotional practice and purity shall be so strong that wherever we chant there will be immediately an impression in the audience for devotion to Krishna.

Regarding management of the society, I have already described this to you in letters to Brahmananda and yourself. So far as the maintenance fund is concerned, that may be sent to me directly. Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
