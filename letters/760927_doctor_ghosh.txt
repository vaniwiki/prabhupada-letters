====== Letter to: Doctor Ghosh ======

Allahabad

My dear Doctor Ghosh,

Please accept my greetings. I thank you for your letter from Canada dated 1st September, 1976. I hope you have seen all our temples in Canada, especially Toronto where we have got the biggest temple in Canada. Very soon we shall have another big temple in Ottawa. I am hoping to stay in India for some months, and hope to meet you in this time.

I hope this meets you in good health. With my regards to Mrs. Ghosh.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
