====== Rsabhadeva ======

Laguna Beach

My dear Rsabhadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter post dated 13rd May, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far as your getting yourself married, I have no objection and if after referring the matter to Karandhara Prabhu, he agrees, then all my blessings are there. And you may inform Yamuna that I am glad to accept her as my disciple and just as soon as I go there, she can be initiated. Presently I am in Bombay and very soon I shall be going to London and perhaps to Moscow. From there I shall be going to N.Y. and on to Los Angeles, perhaps for Rathayatra on June 27th, 1971. At that time, if she is qualified, then she may take over pujari duties there in Laguna Beach. That will be very nice. And you can help her in Deity worship also.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have just received your letters dated 20th and 24th May, 1971 respectively along with a check for $10.00. I am so glad to accept both Yamuna and Sanaka as my duly initiated disciples. Their beads and letters follow. You have my full blessings for marriage to Yamuna.\\
