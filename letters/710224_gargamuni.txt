My dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. In continuation of my letter dated 16.2.71, I beg to inform you that there is a good chance for going to East Pakistan. Sudama has written from Tokyo that he has contacted a nice muslim friend from Dacca. His address is as follows:

Mr. M.A. Mannar Chowdhury\\
Divisional Engineer\\
Divisional Engineer's Bungalow\\
R.T.T.S. Compound, Tejgaon\\
Dacca-8, East Pakistan

Phone: 246-767

If you at all seriously intend to go to East Pakistan, please contact this gentleman and open correspondence with him and if you think it is favorable you may go there with the blessings of Krsna.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. When you go and decide your departure after correspondence with the above gentleman, I will give you further instructions on this. ACB\\
