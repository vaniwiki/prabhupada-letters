====== Jadurani ======

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter. You have asked me something for which it is difficult to answer from such a distant place. You are grown up girl you should rather decide what to do. Fix up your mind always in Krishna and He will give you good counsel.

I am sending herewith two pictures. I wish that you may enlarge one of them in painting. I like both the pictures but as an artist you can make your choice. I prefer the picture which contains all the body of Krishna on my right side. Anyway one of the pictures may be painted in three so that each branch may have one picture.

I shall be glad to know how many pictures you have completed by this time. Hope you are all well by the Grace of Lord Krishna.
