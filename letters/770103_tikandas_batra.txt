My dear Tikandas Batra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 27, 1976, and have noted the contents.

In answer to your questions, sastra says that only for progeny there should be sex, otherwise no sex, "dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo 'smi." No "indriyartha," for sense gratification there should be no sex. But, this sterilization is for sense gratification. That is most sinful. The Indian government is becoming demonic because those who elect the government are becoming demonic.

You can prepare for M.A. examination and live with us. Why not come and live with us? You are a single man. You are in Bombay. What is the difference? Then you can help us as far as possible and at the same time continue your studies.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
