====== Bhurijana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bhurijana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 19, 1969 and have gone over the contents carefully. I know you are a sincere worker, so if you think that by changing the place it will be nice, then do it. Regarding the Jagannatha mask, it is not bona fide. The Footprint of Krishna is all right. You can keep It by the throne and while taking care of the Deities you also wash the Foot, wipe It and put It back. Generally this is done with a little sandlewood pulp. There are markings on the Chest and Feet of the Personality of Godhead. That is the distinction between Him and ordinary living entities. Just like in our palms there are certain marks for a particular person indicating his fame and fortune. Similarly the Supreme Personality of Godhead has got certain signs on His Lotus Feet which are unique for Him only, and they are not to be found in ordinary living entities. In Vaikuntha all the inhabitants have exactly the same bodily features as Narayana, but Narayana is made distinct by the mark on His Chest and Lotus Feet. The Goddess of Fortune recognizes her Husband by these symptoms. That is the version of devotees.

Please offer my blessings to Tosana Krishna and Vrindaban Candra. I hope this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
