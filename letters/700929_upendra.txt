My dear Upendra,

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very encouraging letter dated Sept. 21st, 1970, along with some nice photos of your Sydney activities and some favorable reports from the local newspapers. All this publicity is very nice for our Movement and people are beginning to seriously appreciate our work. I have had good reports also from Jagadisa in Toronto and he says that in Canada the people are very receptive to our Krsna Consciousness philosophy.

I am very glad to now that you are following a strict schedule of devotional service and that will keep you all strong in Krsna Consciousness. Please maintain this standard and improve further. It appears that Krsna is giving you nice facilities and nice devotees also for fulfilling His Mission in Australia. Please train the new devotees nicely and have them carefully read our literatures so they get a fine understanding of our Krsna Consciousness.

Regarding your invitations to speak at different gatherings of "yogis" etc., wherever you go speak pure Krsna Consciousness. God is One. He is All-Attractive. Therefore His technical Name is Krsna. In other words, Krsna is God and God means Krsna. So you can preach this philosophy anywhere, never mind whether it is to yogis or bhogais.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
