My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. The statement on Bhavan's Journal has been sent to them. Also a copy of my letter to Smt. Morarji has been sent to you by Harikesa Swami. Please acknowledge receipt. Harikesa is not working as my secretary now; he has been sent for preaching work.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
