My dear Vasudeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 20 February, 1970, along with an enclosed photograph of one painting of the Spiritual Master rendered by you. In the meantime, I have received also one painting of my Guru Maharaja Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. Both these paintings are very, very good, and I am therefore requesting that you be able to devote yourself full time in developing this great talent of yours. There are many paintings required not only for our Temples, but for illustrating our books also. So I think this work will be more than ample and you will be happy in this work.

I have noted your enthusiasm for painting, but I learn that there is need of many adjustments so that you may be able to execute the work properly. I have written therefore, in this connection, to Tamala Krsna to arrange for your working conveniences before he leaves Germany.

I am also very pleased to learn that the Deities are now receiving proper service and you are developing a great love for Them. Please continue your sincere service with even greater vigor, and your love will grow increasingly more. Actually when this dormant love for Krsna is aroused in the heart of the devotee, there are for him no more problems of life. So continue to chant regularly Hare Krsna and be happy. Your nice service attitude is most encouraging to me.

Thanking you once again, and hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
