====== Dr. Ghosh ======

Allahabad

My dear Dr. Ghosh;

Please accept my greetings. I wish to thank you very much, as I have received you letter of March 15, and noted its contents.

As far as your coming here in Bombay you are welcome at any moment. I am here at least up until the 20th of April and you can come and stay sometime and try to understand the philosophy of the Krsna Consciousness Movement. After the 20th, I may be going to Hyderabad where we have a center, and if you like you may accompany me to Hyderabad. We can continually discuss the Bhagavad-gita.

Our Krsna Consciousness Movement is based on the principles of Bhagavad-gita As It Is, without malinterpretation. Krsna says in the Fourth Chapter

> yada yada hi dharmasya
> glanir bhavati bharata
> abhyutthanam adharmasya
> tadatmanam srjamyaham
> [[books:bg:4:7|(Bg. 4.7)]]

> paritranaya sadhunam
> vinasaya ca duskrtam
> dharma-samsthapanarthaya
> sambhavami yuge yuge
> [[books:bg:4:8|(Bg. 4.8)]]

The whole world is Krsna's property. The material world is a field of activities for the corrupt conditioned souls who desire to enjoy in imitation of the Supreme. For them, Krsna gives facilities for material enjoyment, but He wants the conditioned souls---after finishing their material enjoyment---to come back to Him with bitter experience of material existence.

Therefore in the Bhagavad-gita there is the essence of Vedic instructions. The plan is that the conditioned soul may fulfill his desire for material enjoyment and at the same time be trained up in spiritual identity to come back to Godhead, back to home. As such, Bhagavad-gita contains the solution of all problems of the material world. Unfortunately, foolish people described as __duskrtina,__ do not want to take instruction from the Lord, although it is completely perfect---but they select their own concocted leaders who are themselves blind, and therefore the world is in chaotic condition on account of rascal leaders in all fields. There are so many rascal leaders in politics, social life, cultural, philosophy, religion, etc. They are all misguided. Bhagavad-gita, therefore is the only light from which we can take direction for all our civic activities. Our Krsna Consciousness Movement was started only for this purpose.

Sometimes back, when I was in Moscow, I had discussion with a big professor, Kotovsky, and I challenged him. "Where is the difference between the Communist philosophy and any other? Everyone has to accept a particular leader and follow his instructions under a brand of ism." But because leaders are all fools and rascals, the ultimate result of following them is disappointment. In the western countries there have been many revolutions, in France, England, Germany and Russia, simply to change leaders of this ism to that ism. In India also since India's contact with the western countries, there have been certain types of revolutions, and they are now going on. Recently in our experience there was attempt to drive away the British. This revolution changed India from dependence to independence, but factually the situation has deteriorated from bad to worse. We are old friends, we know that in Allahabad when I was there, ghee was selling for 1 kg. per 1 rupee, and now its costs 20-25 rupees per kg. In this way, things have not improved, in so many ways. This is due to imperfect leaders.

Therefore our propaganda is to educate people to accept Krsna as the perfect leader in all fields of activity, and if people take to it seriously they will be happy in this life and after quitting this body he goes back to home, back to Godhead. There is no difficulty in understanding this philosophy in full brain and it is the urgent necessity that it be spread all over the world.

Therefore the best service to human society is to educate them after the principle of the Gita, otherwise they are losing the chance of perfection in the human life and going down again to the circle of birth and death and transmigration in different species of life numbering 8,400,000. It is very interesting to discuss on this point and it will be a great pleasure for me if you come and stay with me for some time and preach this philosophy amongst the higher section of society. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita:

> yad yad acarati srestas tad tad evetaro janaj
> sa yat pramanam kurute lokas tad anuvartate
> [[books:bg:3:21|(Bg. 3.21)]]

Thanking you in anticipation,

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
