====== Letter to: All GBC’s in the U.S.A ======

To All GBC's in the U.S.A.

My dear GBC disciples,

Please accept my blessings. I have met with Tamala Krishna Goswami and it appears impractical to send anyone to China at this time. I am requesting him to resume his old position as manager of the Radha-Damodara TSKP. Book distribution is my most important concern and these devotees should be given facility to distribute books profusely throughout America. They are also helping with substantial contributions to construct the Temple in Mayapur. Please do the needful to see that everything is done very nicely in a cooperative Krishna Conscious spirit.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Tamala Krishna Goswami will also be assuming his responsibilities as a Bhaktivedanta Book Trustee for America. ACBS
