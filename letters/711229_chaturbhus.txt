====== Chaturbhus ======

My dear Chaturbhus,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter Dec. 1971. I do not know where your father is staying now at present nor why he has kept silent. I had left Delhi a week ago and at that time he was in care Joshi at 4-D Kamla Nagar---Delhi 7. I am writing him why he has not written you and you also can write him at the above address. I received report that you are a nice devotee; continue in this way and Krishna will always help you. In regard to your question about the Bible, you should just answer, "You follow your Bible and I follow my Bhagavad-gita." There was no swastika on Arjuna's chariot. Kapidhbaja means whose flag is marked with a picture of Hanuman. So Arjuna's chariot had the flag of Hanuman on it. As far as the restriction for reading the 10th canto pastimes of Krishna. That is only for those who do not know what is Krishna. But you are initiated, so you can read because you know who Krishna is. For example: when Krishna was 7 years old he lifted Govardhana Hill. The non devotee scholars say that it is mythology, but a devotee will know immediately that Krishna can do anything. Still our Krishna book is so nice that even an ordinary man can read it and derive benefit. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
