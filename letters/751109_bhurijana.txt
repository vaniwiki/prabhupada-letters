My dear Bhurijana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated September 19 and October 17, 1975 with enclosed checks for $100 and $500 respectively. So this is very nice that your checks are getting bigger. You are one of my older experienced students and I am always praying for your advancement in Krsna consciousness. As the husband of your wife, you should see that she is trained up nicely in Krishna consciousness. You also have a child, so this is your responsibility to see that your family no longer again has to come back and take material body in this world of birth and death. This is the responsibility of a father in Krsna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
