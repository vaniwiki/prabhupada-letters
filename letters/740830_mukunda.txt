My dear Mukunda das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 3, 1974 with enclosed copies of the clippings. So something is being done about this discriminatory action. You can keep me informed of further progress.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
