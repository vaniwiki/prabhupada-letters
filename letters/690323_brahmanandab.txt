====== Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of March 19, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, you can accept the class on the 8th instant in the City College. I am going to S.F. on the 31st, so on receipt of your passage money, I shall start on the 7th April, reaching N.Y. sometimes in the evening. And I shall be glad to meet the people from the New College while I am there, as well as Seton Hall College. I would like $100 per lecture.

So far BTG advertisement is concerned, we can accept advertisement in this way---that only two lines shall be mentioned of the name and address of the advertiser, as follows: This space donated by such and such. That means we can add their name and address only, and the nature of their business. The charges for this sort of advertisement should be inside $100 and when on the cover page, $200. In other words, if they are prepared to pay $200 per month, then we can publish one Krishna picture with these lines only (two lines), that this space is donated by such and such. Henceforward, we shall very much be cautious to accept bona fide advertisement, if we do accept it at all.

Regarding Brijbasi printing our books: I do not think they can compete with the Japanese people, at least in the matter of make-up. Because I know there is only one or two presses in India who can actually do very nice work, and I do not expect any first class work at least for books, in the Brijbasi press. Besides that, from our past dealings with them it is our experience that they took too long to supply our pictures, more than a year. This means the management is not very efficient. I think therefore the proposal is not practical. If the Japanese people do not agree to print on our terms then the next step is to start our own press without any controversy.

Yes, we must set up our society as a school as best we can---I have already sent you letter. Please formulate the whole curriculum because we have to immediately submit to the Draft department and if this is accepted that will be great gain for our society. "Bhakti-sastri" is awarded after extensive study of Bhagavad-gita, Easy Journey, and Nectar of Devotion. "Bhakti-vaibhava" is awarded after study of Vedanta-sutra and Srimad-Bhagavatam on a preliminary basis; and "Bhaktivedanta" the highest title, is awarded after extensive study of Caitanya-caritamrta.
