====== Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 8th February, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully.

I am very glad to learn that there is good chance of presenting and preaching our cult in South India, so immediately I've sent you a telegram reading as follows: ARRANGE MADRAS PROGRAM READY TO JOIN FIRST WEEK MARCH LETTER FOLLOWS, and so you can arrange for Madras accordingly. The Sankirtana Party here will be free by the 28th February, 1971 and it will not be difficult for them to reach by 1st March, 1971. Provisionally the Sankirtana Party may remain there at least one week but if there is good chance of preaching, they may continue to stay there more than one week. So far I'm concerned, I'm trying to avoid traveling as far as possible, but if need be, I may also go there for a few days, but that will be settled up when you are actually in Madras. Madras is a good field because these people understand English very easily. So you will have very good chance for preaching in English.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
