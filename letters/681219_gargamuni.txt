====== Gargamuni ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 5, 1968 and I have noted the contents. I have also heard from Purusottama who has spoken to Brahmananda on the telephone yesterday that your father has made it clear that he will not confide in you or trust you to make advancement very easily in his business. Also I have heard that you have decided to leave back to the New York temple. This idea is alright under the circumstances and I think that your father will one day come to regret that he has not cooperated with your plans.

Purusottama has also heard that you are considering to open a store of Indian imports in the new temple on 61 2nd Ave. This idea is approved by me and please try to do it nicely to help support and make improvements in the new large temple. If this temple can be made very attractive then surely it will attract many people to join us in kirtana and to take interest in Krishna Consciousness. Also you may resume your job as circulation manager, we have a much improved Back To Godhead since you have last done this job in New York and I know that you may do very good service in this regard. If you can help your god-brothers in selling ads also, it will be very nice.

So I think that Krishna has seen that your services can be better utilized in the new temple and all the other work that is going on and He has seen fit to give you clue to leave your father's business and come back to the temple. So because you are sincerely in Krishna Consciousness there is no loss. Actually, for the devotee who is working for Krishna there is only gain of spiritual advancement. The fruits of our work is always given to Krishna and so Krishna accepts the responsibility of what these fruits shall be. So this is our principle of work and I request you to always remember this.

I have also received one nice letter %%__%% from you several weeks ago and just now I am taking the opportunity to thank you for this. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
