====== Syamasundara ======

My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of June 19, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Here in Los Angeles I have arrived on the 23rd of June from New Vrindaban. I received your telegram for a loan of $1025, and immediately I arranged to have it sent from New York. I understand from Mukunda's letter dated June 25th that the lease agreement has duly been completed. Now I think you are all happy to have a nice place for our London temple, so just organize it to your best capacity. It doesn't matter when I go there. In the meantime, you give your full attention to decorating the temple, and I am very glad to learn you are making the throne and altar according the the design I sent to you. I learned that Mataji has arranged for the Radha-Krishna Deities for our temple. Is this a fact? If not, let me know, I have already one pair of 24" Deities from Vrindaban that will be dispatched, and as suggested by you, by Janmastami the Deities may be installed.

I am very glad to know that George is interested in recording some Krishna Consciousness album, and it is very happy news. I request you and, through you, your friends, George and John, to make a nice Hare Krishna record sung by the most popular Beatles and assisted by our devotees. That will be very nice. I have all encouragement for you for this purpose. Try to make this Hare Krishna Movement popular through any source that is possible. That is our business.

I thank you very much for your gorgeous, hopeful words that when I go to London, the London center will be pivot for our Krishna Consciousness Movement. I still maintain the idea of a world Sankirtana Party, so we have got men now in Los Angeles, in Montreal, in Boston, in New York, in New Vrindaban, and in London, who can form a nice group of Sankirtana, at least with 25 heads. If we travel, beginning from London, around the world and again come back to London, surely your foretelling will be a factual event. So try your best, and Krishna will help us as He is helping us. Krishna can help us immediately with all of His resources, but first of all He wants to see how much we can work seriously. So the more we become steady and serious, the more help we will have from Him, rest assured.

I shall be glad to know of your further progress in the temple attempts and the recording affairs. Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
