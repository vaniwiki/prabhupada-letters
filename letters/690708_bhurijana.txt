====== Bhurijana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bhurijana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 27, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I can understand that you are in need of some more brahmacaris there, and I have already told Tamala Krishna to send some devotees there. You may correspond with him immediately to make definite arrangements for this. You will be glad to learn that another center has recently been opened in Philadelphia, and another is to be opened very soon in Laguna Beach, 50 miles from Los Angeles. Our policy should be to open branches as many as possible, but not to close a single one. That would be a degradation. I think you have got enough potential opportunity in your center, so go on chanting and things will come out successful.

I am pleased to note that you have decided to remain as brahmacari because it will be the most "undiverting" for your Krishna Consciousness. Actually this is correct. If one is able to remain as brahmacari, that is first class because so much botheration of household life is immediately avoided. But Krishna Consciousness is not limited that one must be brahmacari to execute, or one must be sannyasi to execute. Spiritual means that there is no conditions whatever, so in any position one may be in, he can chant Hare Krishna, preach Krishna Consciousness, and pray to Krishna to engage him more and more in His transcendental loving service.

I remember that when you were in New Vrindaban with me you took some photographs with your camera. Please send these pictures to Brahmananda in New York for our __Back To Godhead.__ In future issues we will be featuring many such photographs of our activities. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
