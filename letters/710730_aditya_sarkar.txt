====== Aditya Sarkar ======

New Delhi

My dear Sri Aditya Sarkar,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 16th July, 1971 and have noted the contents. I was in India until 20th June, 1971. Why did you not come and see me then? If you want to come here to USA, then please contact either Calcutta center (3, Albert Road; Calcutta-17) or our Bombay center (89 Warden Road, 7th floor; Bombay-26 (Akash-Ganga Building)). You can become a life member of our society and then you can come to any one of our centers all over the world.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
