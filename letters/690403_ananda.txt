====== Letter to: Ananda ======

My dear Ananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated March 30, 1969, and I have noted the contents very carefully. Krishna is very much pleased on you because you are alone conducting the Vancouver temple. Don't worry, you will get some men to assist you very soon, and I am searching after someone. In the meantime Mr. Windisch and his wife, Barbara, will return to Vancouver after the initiation ceremony. As you have said, they are very much helpful, and they will continue to help you with your venture.

Have you any correspondence with Annapurna since last August or September? I have not heard from her since then. After returning to her father's house she wrote me one letter, but since then I do not know about her whereabouts. If you can, please let me know her address. My program for next summer is not yet fixed up, but I am booked for various lectures till the middle of May. After that I shall fix up my program for June. If I go to Montreal, then this time I will go to Vancouver also. Mr. Windisch has spoken very highly of you and your decision to not keep unwanted boarders at the temple is nice. Don't feel yourself to be alone because Krishna is always with you. Krishna is always with every living entity as Supersoul, and to His devotee especially He talks and gives instructions how to attain the perfectional stage of meeting Him. So don't feel alone. Always chant whenever possible, read our books, and there will be no great difficulty.

I shall be returning to New York by the 9th of April, and I shall then send you a new set of beads chanted upon by me. I know you are a sincere, silent worker, and if it is not too much inconvenient for you, you can send me at least one letter in a fortnight. That will encourage me and I can then give you necessary instructions how to develop.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
