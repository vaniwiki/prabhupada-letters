====== Ādi-kesava ======

Boston

My dear Ādi Kesava das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 19/7/74. Regarding the boys for initiation, I have initiated them a follows:

Andrew Lerra---Agrani (the foremost)

James Newcomb---Naksatranemi (surrounded by stars---Lord Visnu)

Richard Corbeil---Satangati

So you can have their beads chanted upon by Kirtanananda Swami. My only request is that you see that our men strictly are carrying out my instructions regarding following the rules and regulations.

I thank you for your invitation for your new temple opening. I am now in India and I shall write to you about my future itinerary.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
