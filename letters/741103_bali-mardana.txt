====== Bali-mardana ======

Brooklyn

My dear Bali Mardan das:

Please accept my blessings. I have sent you one letter dated 20/10/74 but not yet received any reply. The copy is enclosed herewith. I request you to come here and see me in India.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
