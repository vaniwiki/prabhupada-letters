====== Satsvarupa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter of 3/12/68 in hand. The evening twilight first appeared as a beautiful girl to attract the demons but later on turned to be evening twilight. There is no reality in the material beauty. What you think as real that is also unreal because everything material transforms into matter at the ultimate stage. It is the spirit soul who is beautiful and not the matter.

I am pleased to learn that Rupanuga is fully conscious about our movement and he has full confidence in his spiritual master. Today I have received one letter from Hayagriva and it is understood that he is feeling our separation. I have replied him and have asked him to see me when I am in N.Y. Hope you are all well. Please keep in touch with Pradyumna's surgical operation affairs.

Your ever wellwisher
