My dear Michael Darby.

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 15 February, 1976, and I have noted the contents. Later this year I plan to come to America and at that time you may find out my itinerary from Kirtanananda Swami and you may come and see me.

Regarding the history of ISKCON, please ask Kirtanananda Maharaja; he knows everything.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
