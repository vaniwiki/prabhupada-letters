Seva Kunja, Vrindaban (Mathura)

Dear Sir,

Replying your letter of 4/5/73, I beg to inform you that there is no question of vacating the house occupied by me.

I am already paying Rs 10/ per month and there is deposit of Rs. 700/. with one of the Shebait. Now all of you together fix up the legal rent after adjusting the deposit money with interest for the last seven years. If we settle up the pending matter amongst ourselves, we save so much legal expenditure, otherwise I will advise Sriman Gurudasa to take the help of the rent court, at your expense.

I don't know what is the content of the letter dated 26/3/73 therefore I am asking for a copy of this letter.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
