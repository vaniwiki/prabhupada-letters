My dear Revatinandana Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 27, 1973 and also the letter from Partha Das. I am glad that you are traveling and preaching. This is your main business. For a sannyasi the more he wanders and preaches, the more he becomes experienced. The people benefit, he benefits, and from a material point of view he'll profit. So constantly travel and distribute books as much as possible.

I have received report from New York today as follows: "we have just broken all ISKCON records for the number of books distributed. On October 27 we distributed 13,486 books in one day. On Nov. 3 we distributed 13,127 in one day along with 10,000 lugdo's." Now New York is heading the list.

Regarding the auto accident, just hold a condolence meeting for Raghava dasa brahmacari and pray for his soul to Krsna for giving him a good chance for advancement in Krsna consciousness. Certainly Krsna will give him a good place to take birth where he can again begin in Krsna consciousness activities. That is sure. But, we offer our condolences to a departed soul separated from a Vaisnava. Do you know that there must be prasadam distributed? After three days after the demise of a Vaisnava a function should be held for offering the departed soul and all others prasadam. This is the system.

Yes I have received reports of London that it is going on nicely. But one report is not satisfactory. That chandelier in the temple has been taken away by the supplier because Syamasundara took it on credit and has not paid. I do not know if it is a fact but it is regretable.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
