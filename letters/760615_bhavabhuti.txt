Madras

My dear Bhavabhuti das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 8, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Before we can begin any construction in Madras we first of all must complete any temple construction that we are presently doing. They are also in want of money. I understand that the Hyderabad Temple is also in want of money to complete the construction, Gopala Krsna knows it. First of all, Bombay and Hyderabad must be finished. The money which was collected in Madras can eventually be used in Madras, but our present projects must be completed, so why are you asking me?

But, where is the local devotees who are coming? You are all foreigners, so how long it will go on? Madras especially they are losing interest in Deity worship. Sometimes the political party is insulting. These atheists class of men who have done this, they should be converted into theism by preaching Bhagavad-gita.

So now there are three GBC's in India and they can consult and make a program how to finance the various programs including the Madras development.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
