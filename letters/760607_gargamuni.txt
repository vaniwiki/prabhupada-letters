====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

Mayapur

My dear Gargamuni Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and I have noted the contents with care.

Yes, it is simply time wasting and money wasting the way construction is going on in Mayapur at present. I have seen also when I was in Mayapur that 50% of the workers are simply wasting time. Best will be to get a __reliable__ construction contractor and adopt the same method that has been done in Bombay. We can check their bill according to the contract so that they do not cheat us.

Taru Kanti Ghosh, since he is favorable, there will be government support. So continue this boat program. I do not know about motor launch or not, but you should consult and do the needful. I simply want to see that the preaching goes on. That's all.

In the hot climates, hold programs at nightime, and the daytime can be used for resting. Also, green mango sherbet can be prepared. Roast the green mango, and take out the pulp. Mix this pulp with a little salt, black pepper, sugar, and make a liquid by adding some water, then drink it. This will give protection from stroke from the heat.

Concerning the Rs. 25,000 for continuing the food distribution program, Pusta Krsna Swami has discussed with Ramesvara Maharaja and there is enough money in the Food Relief bank account in Los Angeles to send this amount to India for this purpose. So Ramesvara Maharaja should be forwarding this amount to you for the prasadam distribution program in Mayapur.

If the Jagannatha Puri land is simply desert, sand, and there is no prospect of growing any vegetation there, like grass and trees and plants, then in the hot season it will be difficult to go there and to remain there. So before we consider this plot of land, it will be necessary to see if there is possibility of vegetation or not. What about the Bhuvaneśvara land?

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
