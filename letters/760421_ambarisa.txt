Boston

My dear Ambarisa das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 22, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. I am happy to know that you are appreciating our work amongst the academic community. This is very important work to gain the acceptance of the academic world. If scientific men and scholars accept, the more that is a great stride. Here we have seen also in India. Burdwan University in Calcutta has taken a standing order. Also, in Benares the university there took 14 Standing orders. Please let me know how the restaurant is developing there, and also assist me in getting our books recognized by the academic circles there in Boston. That will be very nice.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
