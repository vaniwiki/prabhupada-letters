====== Pradyumna ======

My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated January 20, 1968. Los Angeles is very pleasant with clear sky and plenty of sunshine.

Regarding diacritical markings, you may refer to the book First Lessons in Sanskrit Grammar and Reading by Judith Tyberg of the East-West Cultural Center published in 1964. Each letter should be transliterated in a careful manner so that one may be able to know the Devanagari character corresponding. Devanagari type characters will not be there in this new book we are preparing. Markings are as follows.

Here follows the Sanskrit alphabet and English equivalents as are found in Bhagavad-gita etc.

[SANSKRIT CHARACTERS]

You may use the facilities available to you if there is no risk of making trouble. But so far as stealing is concerned, one should not steal except in the rarest circumstances. Moral principle is recommended in all scriptures as prerequisite for spiritual culture. If the conduct of the pure devotee crosses the lines of ordinary morality it is because he acts on the plane of Absolute Morality which is not known to the conditioned soul and cannot therefore be imitated. So generally we should be careful to observe good moral conduct.

Please clear any doubts you may have about what is to be done. You may begin work of transliterating as soon as possible. Hope you are well.

Your Ever Well wisher

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
