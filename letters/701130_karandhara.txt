My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated 28th October, 19th, 13rd, and 10th of November respectively and have noted the contents carefully. Your sentiments for me are very nice and I thank you very much for your sincere attitude which is so encouraging for me.

If we have to repair our house and Mr. Raj Anand is willing to give us the loan and you think there will be no problem in repaying him, then it is all right and you may do it.

I am glad to hear new devotees are coming and do not be worried about some of our members leaving; they will come back. Krishna never forgets the service rendered to him by the devotee and once tasting the nectar of devotional service to the Lotus Feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is not possible to forget Him.

I have received the report of Pittsburgh GBC meeting. I am happy to see you all so active and serious about carrying on the work which I have started. Now I want that all administration may be done by all of you 12 GBC members all over the world. Always keep in touch and consult matters all together for practical execution.

Yes, continue to send money to my book fund so that we shall be able to go on producing literatures of Krishna Consciousness. Thank you for the check of $227.00 for my maintenance fund. You may collect all the payments and send once monthly from L.A. the total amount. That will be better. I have also received the receipts of temple payment for Sept. and Oct. Also the pictures of the sanctuary appear very nice.

My Guru Maharaja used to say "don't worry about money, Do something nice for Krishna and money will come." So we should always be thinking how to distribute the message of Krishna and surely He will give us facility. Even an ordinary man if he wants publicity then he gives so much money for the propaganda work. Similarly Krishna is not poor. He can supply any amount for the devotees who are engaged in broadcasting His glories. I see that you are moving in the schools and universities for preaching. That is very good. Krishna says that this knowledge is the king of education. So it will be appreciated.

Your program to visit nearby cities and towns with a travelling party is nice. Krishna Das has also started this program in Germany and the success has been good.

Regarding worship of Tulasi, it is not very much important. Simply all the devotees may offer a little water every morning and in the evening offer obeisances and ghee lamp (one wick) and circumambulating three times repeating the mantras that I have given you. The plant may remain in the garden.

Hope this letter will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
