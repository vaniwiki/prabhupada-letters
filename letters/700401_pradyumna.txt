====== Pradyumna ======

My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received one check of contribution from Brahmananda and I understand that you have contributed $500, so I thank you very much for this.

May Krsna bless both you and your good wife.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
