My dear Sri Ram Kumar;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter and am very pleased to read the contents. It is rare that an important man like yourself understands the prime importance of the Krishna consciousness movement. In the Bhagavad-gita Lord Sri Krishna says that it is the specific duty of the leaders of society to give an example of Krishna consciousness so that the common people will follow, __yad yad arcarati srethas__ [[books:bg:3:21|(Bg. 3.21)]]. Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that it is the leaders of the society who can understand rightly this transcendental knowledge; __imam rajaso vidhuh.__

So it is very good that you have understood and are following the Lord's instructions in this way. Now you should perfect your knowledge on a solid basis. At your request I am sending a set of my Krsna Books. Enclosed is the bill. You have enquired about Life Patron Membership, and the necessary form is enclosed. The donation is Rs. 2222/-, and when you become the member you receive these Krishna Books and all other books and magazines for the rest of your life. So you can either send payment for the enclosed bill, or you can send payment for the membership and keep the books.

There are so many things to discuss that I suggest that you come here and see me if it is convenient for you. I am here in Vrindaban at least up until September 25th. I must leave Delhi the latest on October 2nd for Bombay.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
