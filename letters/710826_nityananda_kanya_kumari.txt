====== Nityananda, Kanya Kumari ======

<card class="letter">
New Orleans

My dear Nityananda and Kanya Kumari Devi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 23d and 15th August, 1971 respectively and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear that your program is going on so nicely there in New Orleans and especially that Sankirtana and BTG distribution are so successful. That is very encouraging. This Sankirtana and BTG distribution is our main business and you should give as much energy in this direction as possible. Also your travelling Sankirtana party to various universities in the Southern cities is wholly approved by me. So do it nicely and in conjunction with Satsvarupa Prabhu. He is guiding you all. So be serious in following the rules and regulations and chant 16 rounds. These things will give you constant strength and spirit and I am sure that wherever you go in your preaching program you will be successful.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Kanya Kumari (and thank her for her very kind letter) and also to Bhagavata, Subrata, Debra, and Michael. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
