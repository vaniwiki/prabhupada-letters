====== Letter to: Govinda ======

My dear Govinda Das,

Please accept my blessings, I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 23, 73 and I have very much appreciated the pictures of the deities and their surrounding, this is excellent, better than Los Angeles. I have named your deities Kisora Kisori. So go on with your worship and increase it more and more till all Chicago has become aware of Kisora Kisori in your temple.

Regarding Gaura Nitai deities either wood stone or metal, it is all right.

There should be no complaint, under all circumstances we must chant regularly 16 rounds and attend the morning and evening classes, for Krishna we can work like anything, but one lick done for maya it is useless, overendeavoring.

I am going to New Vrindaban and thereafter I shall be happy to accept your invitation for Chicago to meet the Professors as you mentioned. I shall inform you later of my itinerary.

So you are doing nicely, especially the deities have attracted my attention. The credit goes to you and your good wife Srimati Srilekha Devi Dasi. I shall be glad to initiate Naiskarini Devi Dasi as Brahmin along with the other devotees that you have recommended. their names are as follows:

Tom---Tamohara Das Adhikari

Mireya---Mantrini devi Dasi

Lynn Allen---Ranjani Devi Dasi

Kathy Ferio---Kalalapa Devi Dasi

You may perform a fire sacrifice for the initiated devotees and their beads may be chanted upon by Satsvarupa Maharaja.

I hope their all success in Krishna Consciousness, and I am counting on sincere boys like yourself to help me by managing temples all over the world.

I hope you and your Good wife are both well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
