====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated July 26, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding your future settlement in India, You can work in any big city like Bombay or Delhi, because without living in a big city you cannot have a good job. You can also try Calcutta. Calcutta is also a very big industrial city, and if you are posted there, it will be easier for you to look after the Mayapur-contemplated temple. But it does not matter whether you are situated in Bombay, Calcutta or Delhi; wherever is suitable you can accept.

Regarding your dress, you should dress yourself as smartly as possible. Krishna Consciousness does not depend on the dress. It is consciousness. If by dressing yourself very nicely you get honor from your customers, then it is a great asset for business management. So far as your diploma in business management from McGill University is concerned, you must have it by all means. In the __Bhakti-Rasamrita-Sindhu__ it is enjoined by Srila Rupa Goswami that any work, either prescribed in the Vedas or ordinary mundane activities, if the target is to satisfy Krishna, then everything is devotional service. In the __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ also it is recommended by Suta Goswami that ultimate perfection of an engagement is tested by the satisfaction of the Lord. Our aim should be how to please Krishna. As it is said in English also, the ends justify the means. So it is my request to you that keep Krishna always in view and accept anything necessary for your worldly affairs. I am very pleased to note that in such things you consult me. This is a very nice habit. You will please always consult me before doing anything, and I shall try to guide you to my best abilities.

Regarding distribution of BTG or my publications, I welcome your floating a company yourself for this purpose. In that case your company will be another department of the society, although the society has no intention to interfere with your business. But your business will be considered as my business. So think of it very carefully, and it will be very nice. Regarding kholes from Bombay, I was expecting your father's reply by this time. Anyway, I hope to receive the same as soon as possible. Last week I was in San Francisco, and the Rathayatra Ceremony was a grand success. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
