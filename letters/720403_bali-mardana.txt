New York

My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 20, 1972, and I am very much pleased by the latest books from ISKCON Press. Many, many such small booklets may be produced by you, make them very attractive, and they will sell like anything. There is no other literatures like ours in the world, and this information like "Here is God, just see Him, can you give any clear picture of God," this clear understanding of God is not available anywhere else but from our books, so if you are convinced on this point, then produce books voluminously. But one thing is you must also increase facilities in your New York and that side for distributing also, because I have heard that this program is being very much neglected in the eastern part.

Royalties* of 6% should be deposited in my personal account with Bank of America in Pico-La Cienega branch, Bank of America.

Regarding GBC for this Australia zone, that I shall decide in due course, after I have thoroughly seen how things are going.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Regarding Jadurani's questions, the Lord Nara-narayana appeared as twin grown-up youths, in a palace, and there are always sages gathered around.

*Macmillan Co. gives 10%

P.S. Prabhupada just received Rupanuga's letter about changes made in GBC zonal management. His comments: "I do not favor these changes. Tell them to stop everything. Why they have done this without consulting(?)
