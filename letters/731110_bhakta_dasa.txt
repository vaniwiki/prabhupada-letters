====== Bhakta dasa ======

San Diego

My dear Bhakta dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 17, 1973 and have noted the contents. I thank you very much for your invitation for your Govardhana celebration. I would have come, but I received your letter late, but I hope anyway that you have enjoyed Govardhana-Puja. The photos are very nice, and Radharani looks very satisfied, as I see in the features of Her face in the photo. If She is pleased, then Krsna is pleased, and all living entities are pleased.

I thank you very much for installing Radha-Giridhari. From my childhood I was very much fond of Radha-Krsna, and now my good disciples are helping me to open so many Radha-Krsna temples all over the world. It gives me so much pleasure. Now introduce Ratha Yatra. That was my childhood activity. I want to see my disciples all over the world introduce two items, opening Radha-Krsna temples and Ratha-yatra festivals. Do this under the protection of Guru-Gauranga.

Please do everything cooperatively for [you] will be happy, your countrymen will be happy, and all living entities will be happy. If one waters the root, then all the branches, twigs, and leaves are automatically nourished. That is the philosophy of Krsna consciousness.

Yes, I may meet with the Pope when returning to USA from Africa.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
