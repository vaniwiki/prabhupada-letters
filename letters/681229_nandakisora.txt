====== Nandakisora ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Nandakisora,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 19, 1968 and I have noted the contents carefully.

Regarding your thoughts of marriage, I think that for the present time you should take your mind away from such conceptions. Marriage is not so important. Your age is not so ripen that marriage is required. Try to remain as brahmacari, that is important. There will be many girls available in the future, so there will be no difficulty in finding a wife if you are desiring in this way. So try to remain a brahmacari as far as possible. If you should still be very eager, then you may write to Brahmananda in New York because in June there should be a few girls there who will be finished with schooling and available for marriage.

I am glad that you are working sincerely for spreading this Krishna Consciousness movement. Please continue in this way and Krishna will surely help you to advance more and more and finally to go back to Home, back to Godhead. It is nice that you have written to this Reverend Malcolm Boyd, if you can somehow prove to him the importance of this movement of Krishna Consciousness, it will be very nice.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope that you are very well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
