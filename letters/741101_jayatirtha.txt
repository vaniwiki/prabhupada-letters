====== Jayatirtha ======

Los Angeles

My dear Jayatirtha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram reading as follows: LIBERTY BANK TRANSFER OKAY BUT FIRST LETTER NEVER REACHED BANK OF AMERICA SO MONEY NOT TRANSFERRED UNTIL MONDAY 21ST INFORMING TEJIYAS TO CHECK PUNJAB DELHI REGARDING ARRIVAL -JAYATIRTHA

Now one thing is that Punjab National Bank, Vrindaban Branch, reports on having received on October 8 from New Delhi Rs. 277,991/-. If this transfer is not the Liberty Bank money, then what is it? I have not received any word that the transfer of the 21st has arrived.

Also Gurukrpa Swami wrote me on September 30 with a Credit Note from Dai Nippon for Dollars 39,474.73. He said that this money was already in Los Angeles at that time and that you have been advised to transfer the money to Bombay, but it is not yet received at this date.

Also I requested Ramesvara through Brahmananda Swami on September 19 to transfer the balance of Gurukrpa's payment to Dai Nippon of Dollars 108,000.00. Ramesvara had deducted Dollars 22,490.63 for various expenses, but this money must be paid for by BBT and not deducted from the M-V construction funds. So this amount should also be transferred here immediately so that work in Vrindaban may not be hampered.

I hope this meets you well in health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
