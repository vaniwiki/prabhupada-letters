====== Letter to: Jayasacinandana ======

Los Angeles

My dear Jaya Sacinandana dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your offering of Bhaktivedanta-astakam, and I thank you very much. It is very nicely done. I have noted that you also have the aptitude for Bengali language, so you can learn this nicely and then you will be able to preach in Bengal in the native language. It would be very effective. Also, you can chant the Gita-Gan in Bengali and people will profusely take out Gita-Gan. Thank you very much.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
