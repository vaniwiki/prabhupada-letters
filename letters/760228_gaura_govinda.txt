====== Letter to: Gaura Govinda ======

Bhuvaneśvara

My dear Gaura Govinda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 20th February, 1976.

Gopala Krishna was just here to see me, so he has been made aware of Sri Jagadisa Prasad again. He is going to contact Mahamsa Swami and certainly if the man has paid the fee, he should get the benefits as much as the others are getting.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
