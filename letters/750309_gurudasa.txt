====== Letter to: Gurudasa ======

Los Angeles

My dear Guru das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received notice from Saurabha in Vrndavana that we owe 25,000 rs. to the Mukutwala and another 12,500 rs. to Lalita Prasada, and he says that still there are many other deity goods that only been ordered and not paid for. So, I request you to please send the equivalent of at least 30,000 rs. to Vrndavana because there are no collections coming in at this time for the deities and you have ordered this paraphernalia. You should send this money to the Bank of America in Bombay in favor of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Mayapur Vrndavana Fund) account number 16026. Address is Express Towers, Nariman Point, Bombay-1. Please send me a copy of the bank receipt after you send the money.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
