====== Gopiparanadhana ======

Los Angeles

My dear Gopiparanadhana das,

Please accept my blessings. With reference to your letter to Harikesa dated 21st inst., regarding the purport, 2nd paragraph to Bhagavatam 2.2.38, it is clear. Do not try to change anything.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
