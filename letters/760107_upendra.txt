My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13rd December, 1975, and I have noted the contents.

Sri Deoji Punja came to see me in Bombay and he explained the whole situation, of how you missed him. Now you may write him and he has promised me that he will do the needful. Be determined and Krishna will surely help.

As to your question concerning whether relationships between devotees are eternal, the answer is "yes." This is confirmed by Sri Narottama dasa Thakura: "__cakhudana dilo yei, janme janme prabhu sei__", he is my Lord __birth after birth.__ In this way you have to understand, by studying carefully the philosophy. We have got so many books now and I want all of my disciples to read them carefully. Soon we shall be instituting Bhakti-sastri examinations and all brahmanas will have to pass. So utilize whatever time you find to make a thorough study of my books. Then all your questions will be answered.

I hope this letter finds you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
