====== Letter to: Guru-gauranga ======

My dear Son,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Locanananda I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual name: GURUGAURANGA DAS.

I am so glad to learn that you have been such a great help to Locanananda there in our Geneva Center. I can understand that you are a very sincere boy and are very eligible for going back to Home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourself engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

I hope this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
