Los Angeles

My dear Radhavallabha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 13, 1975 with enclosures. Regarding 6th Canto, Nitai has just yesterday sent off Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 and next week he expects to send off Chapters 9 through 13. This will be sufficient for you to publish one volume. I expect before leaving India on September 30th to have finished the 6th Canto. I have received a letter from Jayadvaita das dated September 8th regarding the __Upadesamrta__ book. The title of the book can be __Nectar of Instruction.__ We already have the __Nectar of Devotion__ so now you will have the __Nectar of Instruction.__ You can make it just like the set-up of the __Nectar of Devotion__ book. The words __Sri Upadesamrta__ do not have to appear in the title. A dedication is not required because it is not a big book. The suggestion for the picture of Rupa Gosvami's Govindaji Temple is approved. Regarding the conclusion of the book, yes, it says in the text that the most fortunate devotees execute devotional service near Radha-kunda. That is stated in the book. I am enclosing the introduction for the book; please find.

Regarding the corrections you have sent, this kind of changes is admissible. There is no harm.

Regarding your managing production of Spanish and German books, yes, it is approved by me. Why not?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
