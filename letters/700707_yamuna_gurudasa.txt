====== Letter to: Yamuna, Gurudasa ======

London

My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for sending me the Jagannatha Prasadam pera. This is a very nice sweetmeat, so you learn the art how to prepare it. I think it is purchased from some Indian shop. But you should try to prepare it yourself.

I hope your Rathayatra preparation was completed and the procession very grand and gorgeous. Previously Syamasundara wrote me to participate in the Rathayatra festival, but since then I have not heard anything from him. Where is he now? At George's place or in a different apartment? I have received a letter from Mukunda recently, but I have not received any letter from Syamasundara.

I am very glad to learn that you are vibrating the mantras from ISOPANISAD and BHAGAVAD GITA independently. Here they are chanting these mantras on the streets during Sankirtana Party and the people are responding very nicely.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

The more you advance in Krsna Consciousness, the more you will feel such ecstasy. This is Krsna's grace. So remain fixed up in the service, at the same time try to train others because we shall have to open so many centers. Unless we have got very trained up __pujaris__ it will be difficult for us to install Deities. There is a good advertisement of us in India, and if some Indians come to our temple and see that the __arcana__ worship is not being done properly, then there will be great criticism.

Note to Gurudasa:\\
My dear Gurudasa: Please accept blessings. I have duly received your recent letter. Reply will follow. In the meantime I have written one letter to Ksirodakasayi about visiting India next year. Please let me know what arrangement is being made for this.

A.C.B.
