Dear Mr. Gupta,

Please accept my greetings. I have received your letter of January 31, and examined the contents. Perhaps by now you have already received a letter on my behalf sent by my personal secretary dated January 20th. If not, I am enclosing a copy of same for your inspection.

I thank you for your good wishes and continued interest in our Krishna Consciousness Movement. Please accept my condolences on your recent ill health. Again, I want to invite you, as soon as you are a little recovered in health, to join us in Mayapur on the dates indicated in the enclosed letter. Please go on chanting Hare Krishna, as ultimately the shelter of Krishna is our only solace in this material world. Hope this meets you in improved health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
