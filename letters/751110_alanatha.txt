====== Alanatha ======

Stockholm

My dear Alanatha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two letters dated 26th and 27th September 1975 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following as my initiated disciples. Their names are as follows: Johnnie---Jamadagni das; Maggie---Vedatita devi dasi and Christine---Samhartri devi dasi. I also accept for second initiation Vrsnivallabha das Brahmacari. Enclosed is the sanctified mantra thread and mantra sheet. It is your responsibility as the president of the temple to see that these devotees strictly follow the rules and regulations such as chanting 16 rounds minimum on the beads. 16 is the minimum; one can chant more. There is no harm, but one at least must chant the fixed number of rounds. You should hold a fire sacrifice and they may hear the mantra from my recorded tape through the right year. The beads may be chanted on by Hansadutta.

Regarding the controversy that is going on there in Stockholm, what is the reason. This must be considered at a full meeting of the GBC. You may suggest a way to mitigate this difficulty and if it is not accepted, then both of them should resign. I know that Hansadutta is very expert in selling books but books are not only for selling but also for reading. Now has the GBC become more than Guru Maharaja? As if simply GBC is meant for looking after pounds, shilling, pence. The GBC does not look after spiritual life. That is a defect. All of our students will have to become guru, but they are not qualified. This is the difficulty.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
