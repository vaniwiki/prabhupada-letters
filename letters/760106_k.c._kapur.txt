My dear K.C. Kapur,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 28, 1976.

Thank you very much for your kindly making available your house in Allahabad during the Kumbha Mela. I will have my disciple Gurudas Swami pick up the keys from Dr. Ram Das Tiwari as you have indicated in your letter so that he may make preparations for my coming on the 11th instant.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
