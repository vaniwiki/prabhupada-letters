====== Upendra ======

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. While I was in New York, I got your colored pictures, and each and every one of them is so nice and captivating that I have kept them for future paintings by our artists. I thank you very much for these pictures, and I hope your center is making nice progress by Sankirtana Movement. I shall be staying here in Buffalo for one week, and then I shall go on to Boston.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
