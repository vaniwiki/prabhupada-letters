====== Letter to: Jagajivana ======

Sao Paulo, Brazil

My dear Jagajivan das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 27, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. I am very pleased that you have taken up this mission of spreading the Krsna consciousness movement all over the world. This is the wish of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu that, __yare dakho tare kaho krsna upadesa,__ everyone you see or meet, tell him about krsna; __amara ajnaya guru haya tara ei desa__ [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|(Cc. Madhya 7.128)]], and by My command you become a guru and save this land. This was also the mission of my guru maharaj and it is my mission. You will perfect your life if you make it also your mission.

People everywhere are suffering on account of being led by blind leaders who are devoid of all knowledge of the soul. Such foolish men lead other foolish men and all concerned suffer. __Andha yathandhair upaniyamana,__ when one blind man leads another, the result is that both of them fall into the ditch. Therefore there is a requirement for a section of society to become first class men, free of the influence of the modes of material nature, who can understand the mission of this human form of life and who can teach it to others. I am trying to create these men, but it is hard, for people have become lost of all intelligence due to the coverings of the three modes of material nature. So I am one man alone, yet now there are so many nice boys and girls like you to help me push on this movement in my old age. I thank you very much for your sincere efforts and you have my blessings that you will without a doubt be successful if you stick to the regulative principles and chant at least 16 rounds a day. Surely Krsna will recognize your service, and as soon as you are recognized by Krsna, then your life immediate becomes perfect. So continue your preaching activities all over South America and try and present this Krsna consciousness as it is without any change or speculation, and distribute as many books as possible, for this will have a very great effect on the lives of all those who are fortunate enough to receive them.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
