====== Letter to: Gurukrpa ======

Tokyo

My dear Gurukrpa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated December 20th and 22nd, 1974 and have noted the contents. Also I have received one Credit note no. 134 from Dai Nippon for the amount of 63,752.54 in US dollars. You take this project in Hawaii. Brahmananda Svami is there, so talk with him about it. It will be nice if you make your headquarters in Hawaii. You go sometimes to Tokyo and again come back.

If there is any US bank (I think there is one Liberty Bank), you can remit through their Hawaii branch. I have got an account at that Liberty Bank in Hawaii.

After you give that 100,000 dollars to Ramesvara on Jan. 10th, then you can send money to Hawaii. Until then, the money should come to India. We require it here. The Liberty Bank pass book is with Jayatirtha. You can open an account, HONOLULU TEMPLE CONSTRUCTION account.*

Also regarding sending money out of Japan, you can find some firm in Japan who has to take payment in USA and the matter will be solved. Many Japanese goods are sent to USA. So, payment can be exchanged exactly like with Dai Nippon.

If you can take attention as much as possible in Hong Kong, that is very good.

Regarding your trip to USA, you'll get men, as many as you require.

So far as Central and South America is concerned, that is Hrdayananda's jurisdiction.

Regarding Ganesa Puja, I have received some letters from persons requesting to also perform it. I have explained to them that ultimately it is not required, but if you have some sentiment to get the blessings of Ganesa in order to get huge sums of money for service of Krishna, then it can be done, but privately. I have instructed them that if they want to do it, they must send me at least 100,000 dollars monthly---not less.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
