====== Subala ======

My dear Subala das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 2. It is noted that you are trying to appoint some public engagements as soon as I arrive. My program is that I am going to Calcutta tomorrow. The address is on the letter. From Calcutta I will let you know when I shall arrive there. Probably by the time indicated in your letter. I am very anxious to see you again. I am very much pleased with you & your wife's service to Krishna Consciousness.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
