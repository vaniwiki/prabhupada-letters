My dear Mukunda,

I have not heard anything from you since I have come back to India.

Vinod Kumar who was supposed to reach U.S.A. on visitor's Visa is not granted the same. Please see if it is possible for him to get Immigration Visa. The forms are sent herewith please do the needful & let me know the result. I am awaiting to hear from you at an early date. Improving gradually. My Blessings for all & Janaki.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
