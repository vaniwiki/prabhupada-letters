====== Letter to: Laksmi Narayana ======

Houston

My dear Laksmi Narayana,

Please accept my blessings. I have read your letter dated 19th March, 1977.

As you are recommending these devotees for initiation, I am accepting them. Their initiated names are:

John---Jaya Jagannatha dasa

Lisa---Lalita Krsna dasi

No you must hold a fire sacrifice and they should vow to abide by the four regulative principles and chanting minimum sixteen rounds daily. Dugdhapana dasa may also be given his second initiation and you may find his sacred thread duly chanted on enclosed. After the ceremony he should hear the gayatri tape in the right ear. By your good example teach him how to be brahminical.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
