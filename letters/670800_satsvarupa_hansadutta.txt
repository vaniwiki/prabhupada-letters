...but that we all dedicate our lives or our consciousness (no matter in what capacity) to Lord Krsna. If things can be worked out nicely within the temple, that's all right. But family life requires a certain amount of privacy and convenience, which may not always be available. I am simply concerned that you be happy and contented, so you can prosecute the most important thing, K.C., without being disturbed. Rupanuga and Damodara are both doing nicely in this regard, and I wish the same for you.

Your appreciation of my Spiritual Master is very commendable. One who understands and appreciates the disciplic succession is certainly advanced, and we should always be very careful to give full respect to those who have so carefully handled this Divine Fruit of transcendental knowledge before us. Even a slight change will spoil it. That is why I have always been so careful to give you only those things which I have heard from my Guru Maharaja

Please extend my blessings to Himavati and any others who may be with you. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Prabhus:

Thank you for your letters. I am indeed enjoying my stay here in Vrindaban, and fully appreciate the great opportunity and responsibility that has been placed on me. My love to all. Kirtanananda
