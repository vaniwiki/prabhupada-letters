====== Letter to: Prabhas ======

Vrindaban

My dear Prabhas das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and have noted the contents. If you have your ticket, I have no objection to your coming to USA. You should consult with Gopala Krishna Prabhu.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
