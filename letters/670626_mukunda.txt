====== Mukunda ======

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 20, 1967. Although I am passing through critical stages of my health, still good reports from San Francisco, Montreal, and New York are giving me life. I understand that the certificate which you were to receive by registered post was dispatched from Calcutta on 2 May by ordinary mail, and it might be missing; so I have asked Tirtha Maharaja to send another to your address. The copy of the letter addressed to Tirtha Maharaja is enclosed. Please look for the mail. I hope the certificates which you have already are sufficient; but still, this certificate from Tirtha Maharaja will be more valuable.

I have fixed up to start for San Francisco on the 5th July, and the rest remains on Krishna.

Hope you are all doing well. Offer my blessings to Srimati Janaki Devi.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
