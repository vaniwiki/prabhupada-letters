My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 20, 1968, regarding your illness. So long we have got this material body, the miseries will be coming and going, simply we have to tolerate them and try to make advancement in Krishna Consciousness as best we can. I am forwarding your letter to Brahmananda for taking care of your hospital charges; I do not know just what arrangements can be made, but Brahmananda will think how to take care of it.

You mention that you have enclosed the transliteration work of Srimad-Bhagavatam, but I do not find it here. You may have missed it. Anyway, I am happy to hear you are steadily studying Sanskrit and reading Srimad-Bhagavatam---that is very good.

I shall be praying to Krishna for your steady recovery and continual advancement in Krishna Consciousness, and hope you will be feeling physically stronger when you come to see me in New York. Please keep me informed how you are feeling.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
