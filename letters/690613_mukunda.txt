====== Mukunda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 7, 1969, as well as another letter signed by you, Syamasundara, Gurudasa and others jointly. It is very gratifying that at last you have got a five-story building, and in the meantime negotiations are continuing for a church. It is very good news and I thank you for your joint invitation.

In your letter dated June 10th it is said that I shall not go to London earlier than July 20th. I do not know what is your financial position because you have not mentioned anything about our passage money. So kindly let me know if you are going to send me the money for passage, or if I will have to arrange for it. On receipt of this necessary information I shall do the needful. In the meantime I have replied Syamasundara's letter wherein I have stated that some of the devotees here are prepared to go to London. One brahmacari, Trivikrama das, from Buffalo will send you a telegram concerning this matter.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. In your previous letters, I was informed that in London I will have many engagements including interview with Archbishop of Canterbury. But in your letter under reply I understand that I will have to meet people in my apartment. This means that my presence is not very much needed. If you think so then why this invitation? Please clear the matter.
