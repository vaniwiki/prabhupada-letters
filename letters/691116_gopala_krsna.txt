====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter dated November 11, 1969 with enclosed __BTG,__ French edition. Krishna is giving you gradually more and more strength to serve Him. Just like a wrestler, simply by practicing wrestling amongst friends, gradually becomes stronger and the body is built up very nicely, Krishna Consciousness is exactly like that: The more you serve Krishna, the more you get better strength to serve Him. Please remember this valuable advice and you will find it very convenient for your progressive march. The __BTG__ French edition is very nicely done. Even if our endeavor is not always successful, because it is done for Krishna, by nature it becomes nice. We have nothing to do with material considerations. Janardana came to see me about one fortnight ago, and he is also eager to do something in Paris, so be in correspondence with him. I am very glad to learn that Yasodanandana's name is given as the editor, and encourage this nice boy more and more. I have received your shawl duly and I have already acknowledged it. It is very nice. I am using it for my dress garments.

Regarding the Mayapur center, this is almost settled up that we shall have a temple there. Very soon we shall purchase a piece of land there, so when you return to India it will be in your charge for constructing a temple in grand scale there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

PS: I have received the bank receipt of your contribution to the Book Fund, and thank you very much for this.
