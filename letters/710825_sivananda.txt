My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21st August, 1971 and have noted the contents. About taking jobs I have already sent one letter to Hansadutta in this connection. But if there is no other way then temporarily you may take some job and help, but that is not a permanent business. Our main business is to distribute BTG and Sankirtana and whatever little income we get from that we should be satisfied. It is not our business to take jobs and live luxuriously. So far I have heard Sankirtana party and distribution of BTG in Hamburg is increasing. Maybe they can improve their condition without help from your center. So use your discretion.

Now in Hrsikesa the Narayana temple is there but the people are not very advanced. More or less they have become temple priests, and not so much interested in spiritual advancement of knowledge. So there is no need of going there. We have got enough engagement here for preaching in the Western countries and we have got sufficient stock of knowledge in our books. But if there is opportunity and if and when you go to India you can visit this place but it is not very important.

So far worshiping Ganesa is concerned, that is not necessary. Not that it should be done on a regular basis. If you like you can pray to Ganapati for removing all impediments on the path of Krishna Consciousness. That you can do if you like.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Vrindadevi. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
