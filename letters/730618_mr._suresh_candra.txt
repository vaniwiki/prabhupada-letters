Dear Suresh Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21 May 1973 and I have noted the contents.

I am pleased to note that as of January 1st you have given up eating of meat, fish or eggs, as well as intoxicants and gambling. You have asked what is meant by illicit sex. . Sex should be used only in marriage for begetting nice children to raise in Krsna Consciousness. Krsna says in the __Bhagavad-gita__ that I am sex life performed according to religious principles. Sex life for any other purpose means illicit sex. The use of contraceptive method for sex enjoyment is very sinful. Restraint in the matter of these four sinful activities is achieved by tasting the superior mellows of Krsna Consciousness. You say that you are chanting 15 minutes daily from 8:15-8:30. Please go on and increase this chanting as much as you can and that will help you very much in advancing in Krsna Consciousness.

Regarding your request for cassette tapes, we have organized a whole department for distribution of my lectures on tapes and you may obtain them by writing to Golden Avatara. Productions, 3764 Watseka Avenue, Los Angeles, California.

Simply by hearing the philosophy of Krsna Consciousness and chanting Krsna's names all dirty things will be cleaned from the heart.

Hoping this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
