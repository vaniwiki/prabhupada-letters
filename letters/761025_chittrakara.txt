====== Chittrakara ======

My dear Chittrakara Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22nd September, 1976, I have noted the contents carefully.

Hansadutta Maharaja has also given me an account of your activities in Kabul. It doesn't matter that you have been asked to leave the important thing is that you are trying to spread the message of the lord all over the world. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says very clearly, that anyone who tries to broadcast his message is considered most dear and there is no one dearer to the lord than such a sincere preacher.

If you can collect money there as you have suggested and send it for Nitai Gaura TWSKP activities in India that will be good. There is no restriction for preachers, they may travel everywhere all over the world. Nitai-Gaura means world wide preaching, because Lord Caitanya appeared to spread this movement to every town and village of the world, and by the grace of good souls like yourself the desire of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is being fulfilled in the modern age.

So collect and send, Hansadutta Maharaja is doing nicely and can utilize any amount we are planning a big Kumba Mehla

You have my blessings all the time, continue to preach with enthusiasm, keep Hansadutta Maharaja informed about your activities. I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
