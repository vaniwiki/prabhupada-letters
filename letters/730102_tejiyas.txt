====== Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejiyas,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter dated 21 September 1972 is in hand and I am especially glad to note that you have got that apartment in Bengali Market, Babar Road. Now you have got facility for spreading Krsna consciousness in Delhi, and I know that you are very sincere and serious preacher, therefore Krsna has given you to utilize on His behalf. You have mentioned one life member meeting and some queen is helping, but I do not understand what queen that is or what is that life member meeting. You may please inform me everything in connection with the Delhi business, I am always anxious to hear from you. I think that they have sent you books from Bombay so now you distribute them as profusely as possible and make also life members, as many as possible. I am informed there are many so-called hippies staying at Delhi, so you try to recruit some of these men or other local men to assist you there. Your description of struggling is to be understood as the mercy of Krsna, and when He is satisfied by your giving energy in this way just to please Him despite all conditions of difficulty, then you need not worry for money, there will be sufficient and more.

I am including herewith one letter to the Minister of Home Affairs. You present him with a full set of our books, including __Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita,__ like that, and give him also my letter. Try to present them personally to him. Actually you may take this opportunity of being situated at Delhi to make every Parliamentary member our life member also. You can get the list of addresses and systematically approach each and every member of Parliament to become our member also. So many big big lawyers, doctors, government ministers, professional men are there in Delhi, I think more than any other city of India, and they are all intelligent men, they can be easily recruited for life member by simply showing the books and requesting them to kindly help us in this way. So make many, many life members amongst this class of men, that will be your great contribution. Whether there were any news clippings on the Parliamentary proceedings that you sent me?

Hoping this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
