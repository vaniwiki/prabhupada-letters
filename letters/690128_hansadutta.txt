====== Hansadutta ======

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 22, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. From your letter I can understand that you will no longer be negotiating for purchasing the house, and this is all right because I do not think it is very suitable for a temple.

Regarding your question about Vasudeva, the father of Krishna, you should understand that he is not simply a symbol. The statement made in __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ in this connection is meant for understanding, but unless one is in Vasudeva's position, it is not possible to understand Vasudeva or Krishna. Vasudeva's position means to be situated in pure goodness. In the material world, the three modes of nature which are named ignorance, passion and goodness, are always found mixed up together. In other words, these modes are never found pure, but if there is one mode present, there is sure to be at least a tinge of another mode there also. For this reason, we may sometimes see a third class man showing the quality of goodness, and we may see a first class man showing hints of ignorance. The modes are never found in a pure state in the material world. But in the Vasudeva stage of pure goodness there is no contamination from any material influence of passion or ignorance. Vasudeva is never to be understood as being a symbol. You should clearly understand this.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Himavati. I hope this will meet the both of you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
