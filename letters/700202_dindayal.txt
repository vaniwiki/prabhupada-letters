====== Dindayal ======

Montreal

My dear Dindayal,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to accept you as my disciple, and I am returning herewith your beads duly chanted upon by me.

Your initiated name is Dindayal das Brahmacari. __Din__ means poor and __dayal__ means merciful. Krishna is so very merciful to those who are very humble in their attitude engaged in the service of the Lord. Lord Caitanya advised, therefore, one should be humbler than the straw and more tolerant than the tree and thus be seriously engaged in glorifying the Lord. This world is very awful. Anyone is ready to create some disturbance, especially they are very much apt to disturb Krishna Consciousness persons because that is the way of demoniac life. So, in order to protect us from all dangerous elements, we have to chant the Hare Krishna Mantra regularly being humbler than the straw and more tolerant than the tree. Then Krishna, Who is Dindayal, will bestow His Mercy upon us.

Please, therefore, chant regularly sixteen rounds of beads daily, always be engaged in Krishna work in a humble state of mind, follow the regulative principles of no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no intoxicants, no illicit sex life and no gambling or mental speculation and study our literatures and be strictly trained up in Krishna Consciousness with the help and guidance of Jaya Pataka Prabhu.

I am very glad that you are finding in chanting of Hare Krishna the highest pleasure. If we follow the regulative principles and program as above that pleasure will go on increasing more and more. So chant Hare Krishna Mantra, and be happy. That is my request.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
