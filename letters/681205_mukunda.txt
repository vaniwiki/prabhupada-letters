====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

London

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of Nov. 30, and have again noted with encouragement the progress of your activities in London. For your sincere efforts in spreading this movement in so far away country as London, I am certain that Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is most pleased and will surely bless you for your nice work. Regarding my meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, please arrange for this. We will talk with the Archbishop on a religious basis and we may also invite many respectable elites of the city to participate in this important meeting.

Actually, we are not preaching a particular type of faith. We are teaching the post graduate studies of all religions: we are teaching people how to love God and who is the man that will deny this principle? This basic principle we can talk with any religious head and any sincere religious man will appreciate it. We simply want people to become God conscious and that will bring forth real peace in the world. So if the Christian heads of the different churches will cooperate with us, we can render very valuable service to the whole of human society.

I have received one nice letter from Malati Devi and please convey my blessings to the others as well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
