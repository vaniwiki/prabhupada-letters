====== Letter to: Gaura Govinda ======

Bhuvaneśvara

My dear Gaura Govinda,

Please accept my blessings.

I am prepared to come to Bhuvaneśvara immediately to begin construction on the following conditions. The growth of the temple should be based on book distribution. I am prepared to print books. You can then sell them and 50% of the collections must then be returned to the BBT to pay for the books. The balance can be used for construction. Whatever you can raise by this method, I am prepared to give an equal amount toward the construction. In other words, the amount required for construction will come 50% from your side and 50% from me. In the beginning I can advance something if necessary so that we may begin immediately. I will print books for you to distribute. You distribute, and whatever you collect, 50% must go to the BBT to pay for the books.* The balance may be used toward the construction. Whatever you can raise in this way for construction, I will give an equal amount. And, in the beginning I may give some advance. Is that clear? So, let me know whether you like this proposal. If you agree, I am prepared to come there immediately to begin work.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Some Oriya scholar may be engaged to translate our books under your check to expedite printing work.\\
