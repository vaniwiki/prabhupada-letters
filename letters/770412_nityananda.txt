My dear Nityananda:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 29 March, 1977.

Oh yes, it is quite correct to try for complete exemption for your land. Why we should be taxed? Our work is all welfare work meant for the good of the general public. Such properties are always given tax exemption as you have pointed out to the newspapermen. The presentation of our position in the article is nicely given.

Yes, if our householders cannot distribute books, then let them live in the farm communities. They can produce thread for cloth, spinning, and other such activities. But they must do something, not sit idly, for an idle brain is the devil's workshop.

As you have recommended them, I am accepting for first initiation Kiki Laureen Cogan and David Hughes. Their initiated names are Krsna Kripa dasi and Dasanu dasa. Now you must hold a fire ceremony and they must vow to follow the four regulative principles and chant 16 rounds daily. I also accept Kamarikanta devi dasi and Jagatkarta dasa for second initiation. Jagatkarta's brahmana thread is duly enclosed. After the fire ceremony they may both be allowed to hear the Gayatri mantra from the tape in the right ear. By your good example teach them how to be brahmanas.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
