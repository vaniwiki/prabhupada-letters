My dear Narayana Dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 4, 1975 and have noted the contents. Hanuman is not GBC. If he cannot work under Hrdayananda Gosvami, then he must work under me. He cannot be independent. I never said he was GBC. You should continue your programs there under the direction of Hrdayananda Gosvami. If Hanuman wants to preach there as long as he does not create any disturbance, he can preach there. I am enclosing one letter to Hanuman which you may present to him explaining his position.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
