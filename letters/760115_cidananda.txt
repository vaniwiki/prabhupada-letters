====== Cidananda ======

Santa Cruz

My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 23rd, 1975 which I only received recently. Probably it has been forwarded a number of times before arriving.

Anyway, I have read your letter, and it is my opinion that you should return to Santa Cruz. But where ever you stay you must chant 16 rounds daily and strictly adhere to the regulative principles as well as try to study my books.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
