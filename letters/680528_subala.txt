====== Subala ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Subala,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated May 24, 1968, and it is very encouraging. I am sure Krishna will help you more and more because you are sincere servant of Krishna. He blessed in your endeavor and everything will be all right gradually, and it will be a great enlightenment for you how God helps those who help themselves, especially in the service of God.

Read __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ and chant Hare Krishna and all other things will be adjusted automatically. Offer my blessings to Sriman Hal, who is taking gradual interest in Krishna Consciousness.

I am going to Montreal by middle of the first week of June, and I will stay there for some days. You can send me letters at that address after first of June.

Hope you are feeling well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
