====== Letter to: Mrs. Blasko ======

Tuscaloosa, Alabama

Dear Mrs. Blasko,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 12, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care.

Now that the Dallas Gurukula has been closed we have opened many smaller regional Gurukulas on some of our farming communities, such as our farms in Vancouver, Pennsylvania, and also Mississippi as well as others. It is best if you go to one of these regional Gurukulas where you can be nicely engaged in Krishna's service, and your young daughter can go to Gurukula.

Concerning the 88 acres of land there in Alabama, you can contact our GBC secretary for that area, Balavanta das Adhikari, c/o Iskcon Atlanta, 1287 Ponce de Leon Ave., N.B., Atlanta, Georgia 30306. He can assist you in this connection.

I hope that this meets you and your daughter in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
