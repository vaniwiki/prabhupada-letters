====== Letter to: Bhagavata ======

Calcutta

My dear Bhagavata dasa,

Please accept my blessings. This is to introduce Sriman Svadhin Kumar Mullick of 50A, Hari Ghose St., Calcutta-6. I do not remember whether I have seen him before, but his grandfather was my very intimate friend. This boy is coming from a very respectful family, Mullick. I think he is slightly deformed by one hand. Anyway, please admit him to be trained up to be a devotee. He appears to be educated. Let him read our books, follow the regulative principle, and be trained in our line. Then, when I go to Calcutta, I shall see how much he has advanced and then we shall give him some definite engagement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
