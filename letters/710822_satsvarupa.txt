====== Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 19th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far the "tracts" or booklets are concerned, that is a nice idea, Jayadvaita has already asked about this and I have agreed. But these small works may be done on our own press. Dai Nippon should be given the big jobs. Otherwise it will be too costly.

So far the marriage proposed for 29th August, I have no objection provided they are firmly in agreement never to separate and are willing to sign such a statement. This was done recently by Rupanuga Prabhu and you can get the wording from him.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Enclosed please find poetry for possible publication. I don't think there is need of immediate meeting of all GBC members at N.Y.
