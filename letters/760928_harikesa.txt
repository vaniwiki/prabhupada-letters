====== Harikesa ======

New Delhi

My dear Harikesa,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much perturbed to hear you are suffering from maleria in Delhi. So don't be worried, you'll very soon recover, but I think it is a hindrance for you going to Europe. I therefore request you not to proceed to Europe immediately, but stay and recoup your health, and then we shall think over your going abroad. In the meantime deposit the money in my account at State Bank of India, Connaught Place. Tejiyas knows the bank and he will do the needful.

Hoping for your speedy recovery.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
