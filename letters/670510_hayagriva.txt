My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that it has now been arranged that Geetopanisad shall be now printed in India and therefore you are requested to send me back all the corrected forms of manuscripts on receipt of this letter.

Besides that Back to Godhead is now to be printed in our semiown press so I think you should now come back to New York to see the work nicely done.

Awaiting your early reply and early compliance. Hope you are all well. With my blessing for all

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
