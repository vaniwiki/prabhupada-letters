====== Govinda ======

Kona, Hawaii

My dear Govinda dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 1, 1973. I thank you very much for the check for $20,000.00 which has been duly received by me.

I understand however that out of the sale of the Temple, $54,000.00 was taken as net proceeds so where is the balance money? Has Gaurasundara spent or distributed it? I also understand that Balabhadra has been paid $15,000.00 by Gaurasundara so $15,000.00 and $20,000.00 makes $35,000.00 so where is the balance of $19,000.00?

Anyway, I beg to request you to arrange for sending the balance money because for our Vrindaban project we require a few lakhs of rupees immediately. In Bombay also we have purchased a large tract of land at Juhu Beach so why not ask Balabhadra to send his $15,000.00 and Gaurasundara also to send the balance money?

My plan is to come to Hawaii by mid January 1974 when, of course, we shall meet together. I have no ill feelings against Gaurasundara, rest assured, neither anyone is accusing him or you. Everyone considers it has been done by some supernatural influence on Gaurasundara. We suffer on account of our karma---that is a fact. In this material world our karma is responsible for everything. Therefore, due to our work we create our own circumstances. So, if you like to cooperate with our missionary work you are welcome to return back. I have already written a previous letter to you, a copy of which is enclosed.

At the present, I am so pleased that you have found some shelter and an opportunity to preach---it is all by Krsna's Grace. If you like you can come here or if you are satisfied, stay there. At any rate, go on with preaching work---that is our main business.

When we meet in Hawaii we shall discuss everything in detail. In the meantime, kindly induce Balabhadra and Gaurasundara to send the balance money. I still have very high regard for Gaurasundara. I have praised him always for being a kind and gentle boy. All of a sudden he has gone crazy even to the extent of abandoning you. It will all be forgotten history if you again begin preaching work sincerely.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
