My dear Srutadeva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 3, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for your sincere endeavors to distribute my books widely. If you continue with such desire and determination, Krishna will give you all strength to increase more and more.

I appreciate your Sankirtana Newsletter greatly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
