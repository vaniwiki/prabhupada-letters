<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. Your note along with Rayarama's is in hand and I am so glad to read it. Yes wait for the final decision of MacMillan & Co. & I quite agree with you. If they take up our work it will be very very good so let us wait for it. So you need not send manuscript until you hear final word from MacMillan. I am glad to learn that Kirtanananda Swami is now in N.Y. & that he looks very nice in midst of his glowing God-brothers. But he would have been looking more nice if he had stayed in London for a few days as it was settled here. Anyway I shall be very glad if Kirtanananda goes with Rayarama to London & opens a branch there cooperatively. He has got an introductory letter for a London lady. Immediate correspondence may be opened with her.

Regarding Ambassador Nehru I am especially interested in him because he wanted to help me in getting my permanent visa. Please try to utilize him in some way or other to get this visa otherwise I am quite fit to return to your place. I am always anxious to be with you for the remaining days of my life, preaching Krishna Consciousness in the Western World. This time I shall go with the determination for my mission in the Western World & try & get me a permanent visa or immigration papers---whichever is easiest. I think you have my certificates in my apartment & you can utilize them. Two very important things are resting with you. First arrangement with MacMillan and second to get my permanent visa. You are very sincere and Krishna will certainly help you in this attempt. I have duly received the bank receipt along with the letter.

The pictures that you ordered from S.S. Brijbasi & Sons have been sent to San Francisco by mistake. Write Mukunda that you may get them back. He has received 3000 pictures from them by air.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
