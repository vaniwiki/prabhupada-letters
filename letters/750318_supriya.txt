My dear Supriya,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 9, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for your kind sentiments and the $100 daksina. Upon the recommendation of your temple president Govardhana dasa, I am accepting you as my initiated disciple. Your name can be Sukrta dasa. I am hoping that you will fulfill your promise to chant at least 16 good rounds a day and to follow all of the four regulative principles. These things are of the utmost importance. Your beads will be sent along with Govardhana dasa.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
