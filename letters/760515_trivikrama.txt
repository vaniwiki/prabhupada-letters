My dear Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 10, 1976, along with enclosed pamphlet printed in Korean language and photographs of preaching activities in South Korea.

I am very pleased to know that you are doing something solid there. What should be the objection on the part of Gurukrpa Maharaja that you cannot stay there several weeks until you get your missionary visa? There is no cooperative spirit. So you are actually doing preaching work in South Korea, and our mission is one, so why there is objection that you stay in Japan for receiving visa for Korea?

Under the circumstances, I have no objection to your staying there with your party until you receive the missionary visa for South Korea. Gurukrpa Maharaja should assist you in whatever way he can and both of you work cooperatively together.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. We have just received advance copies of the Bhagavad-gita Chinese translation, the first 6 chapters. Might this be of some value to your preaching work in South Korea?
