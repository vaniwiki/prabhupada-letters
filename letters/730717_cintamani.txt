====== Cintamani ======

New Vrindaban

Dear Cintamani dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your undated letter and I have carefully examined the contents.

You have written that you are not sure what Krsna wants you to do and that Palika dasi has invited you to go to Hyderabad to come help with the deities. So I think that is a good idea that you go to India and you can do so as soon as possible. We require many more devotees now in India so it will be very nice if you can go.

You ask how you can become free of envy. Simply by chanting Hare Krsna, Lord Caitanya has said the heart will become cleaned of all the dirty things accumulated in the heart. It is not that we have to endeavor separately to become rid of envy or any deficiency or impurity. In this age the chanting of Hare Krsna is recommended as the only possible method to associate with Krsna. By offenseless chanting, when we associate with Krsna through His Holy Name, then all inauspicious things are cleared from the heart. So wherever you are you should always go on chanting, and that in itself will bring all perfection.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
