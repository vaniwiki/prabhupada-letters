====== Gaura Hari ======

<card class="letter">
Victoria, B.C., Canada

My dear Gaura Hari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14th May, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Also I have seen the newspaper clippings enclosed and they are very nice. The devotees are looking so cheerful also. So I have named Paulin as Prafullamukhi Devi Dasi. Prafullamukhi means one who always has a cheerful face. Her beads and letter are enclosed herewith. I have received the check for $5.

It is so much encouraging to note how nicely things are going on there in our newly developed Victoria center. Simply if you will depend on Krishna, He will help you more and more. I am also glad to note how nicely book distribution is going on there. Continue it and try to increase more and more. This book distribution program is so very much important. Also you should try and increase your programs at the schools and colleges and try to have a regular credited course at the University also.

Your temple building seems to be very suitable. And the rent is very reasonable also. It is all Krishna's mercy. So take proper advantage and develop it nicely. If you can support yourselves by selling certain of your crops grown there, why not? And you can cultivate Tulasi devi also. Write Govinda Dasi in Hawaii in this regards.

Your proposed asrama can be located anywhere, it doesn't matter. Just wherever you can attract most people.

Person means not a dead stone. Person means all living entities. We cannot understand in our present material condition. An example is a stone in the spiritual world; if I ask it to move, it will move automatically. In the material world it will not. Universal form is a person also, and from that universal form so many things are appearing.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
