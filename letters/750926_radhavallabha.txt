====== Radhavallabha ======

Los Angeles

My dear Radhavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 19, 1975 and the two copies of the three other parts of Caitanya Caritamrta. Yes, I am very pleased with how you have done it. I have ordered you in two months to do it, and you have done it. I know you have worked very hard. The art paintings are very, very good. Everyone likes them, and I know they have worked especially hard. You should know that I am very pleased that you have fulfilled my request without any hesitation. This is your success in spiritual life. The photographs are all also wonderful. He has done nicely, the boy Bhargava.

The translations . . . I am not using. There is some fault. I am doing the translations, and Nitai will see that the synonyms are done. I have finished now the Sixth Canto and have already started the Seventh Canto.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
