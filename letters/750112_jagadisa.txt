My dear Jagadisa das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 31, 1974 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for the nice book distribution report. Chicago temple is doing very nicely. Give them many thanks. There are so many devotees there in your zone. So, you must see that every one of them is chanting at least 16 rounds daily and observing our rules and regulations strictly. Keep everything nicely in this way. This is the duty of GBC, to see that all of our members are becoming fixed in Krishna's service.

If you think it best, you can set up headquarters at Gurukula.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
