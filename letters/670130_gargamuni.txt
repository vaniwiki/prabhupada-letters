====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

My dear Gargamuni,

Since I have come here I did not hear from you. Hope you are doing well with full cooperation of your elderly God brothers. Did you go to your mother along with Brahmananda? I hope she is alright now. I have already transferred $5000.00 to the A/c of International Society for Krishna Consciousness Inc. Checks should be drawn with full deliverance. Have you transferred $200.00 to my account instead of sending the check to Mr. Altman? I have already sent you instructions in this connection. Shall be glad to hear from you. Hope you are well.

Yours ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Up to date I have only 5 tapes with me. Please let me know how many you counted altogether.
