====== Letter to: Jayapataka ======

Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I wish to have a report of the situation with the land acquisition in Mayapur. I will be in Hawaii until June 1, then in Los Angeles until June 11.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
