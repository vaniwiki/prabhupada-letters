====== Hayagriva ======

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter of Oct. 10, 1968 with press cutting is very much encouraging. When a devotee is seriously prepared to serve Krishna, the Lord gives him both intelligence and opportunity to serve Him more and more, so that the serving devotee may ultimately reach the Lord without any doubt. The symptoms appear to be as above mentioned. Please therefore utilize the opportunity of service diligently and it will be a great spiritual achievement for you and a great service to your country and community.

My program for European tour is not yet fixed and as such I shall be glad to go to Columbus as soon as you call me. I wish to see also New Vrindaban very soon. I hope you have received my letter previous to this. Hope this finds you all in good health.

Yours ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
