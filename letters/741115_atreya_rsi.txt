My dear Atreya Rsi dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 28, 1974, and it is received so late on account of touring. I have sent you one telegram as follows: AUDIT YOUNG ATTAR TEHRAN LT COME AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE BEFORE NOVEMBER 30 -AC BHAKTIVEDANTA SWAMI.

You say that you are all fools. When you can understand that you are a fool that means that you are a little intelligent because you can detect your own foolishness. Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to remain a fool just to teach us how to make progress in spiritual life. All Vaisnavas not artificially but seriously think themselves as foolish. The more we remain foolish, the more we remain eager to learn for spiritual advancement in life.

Now you are a practical business manager, so we are expanding by Krishna's grace; so try to make some formula so our institution may go on without any difficulty. In your letter to Ramesvara you call for a meeting of GBC to develop a system of management and communications which will eliminate chances of recurrences. This is a good suggestion you have made, so when we next meet together, you must give it some practical shape.

You have also mentioned to repeatedly offer obeisances to your spiritual master. This is very important. A disciple should offer dandabats, not namaskara. The more one becomes fixed up in guru obeisances, the more he advances in spiritual progress. __yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau__ [ŚU 6.23].

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
