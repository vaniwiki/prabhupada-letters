My dear Jagannatha dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 13, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding your joining the travelling party for Sanskrit work, I have no objection, but these things have to be decided amongst yourselves. I do not know how the Press is managed for doing this work. Who will do your work if you leave? These things you all have to manage. My business is to write the books, and it is your responsibility to publish them. If you are talented to work on the Sanskrit department, then you should do that. This is important work.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
