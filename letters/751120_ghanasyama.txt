====== Ghanasyama ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ghanasyama das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 4, 1975 and was very pleased to read the contents. On the whole it is very encouraging that the professors like our books. This is our success. This quotation is very important: "One professor went on to explain that the other books were mostly dealing with speculations in contrast to our books which presented religion as a way of life based on authentic writings." This is a very good quote. This should be publicized and it should be published in the new book that is being presented of all the quotations, __The Hare Krishna Movement is Authorized.__ As I had ordered you to preach and distribute to the libraries, so you are doing it. So I am very pleased with your activities. Now continue and increase. Everyone will want our books. We will always have customers. This is Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mercy.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
