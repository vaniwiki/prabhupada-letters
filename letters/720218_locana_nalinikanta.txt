====== Locana, Nalinikanta ======

Berkeley

My dear Locana das, Nalinikanta, and all the boys and girls at Berkeley Center,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your many invitations to come there to enjoy with you the Lord Caitanya Day parade and festival at Berkeley. I am always thinking of that beautiful, quiet neighborhood in Berkeley, and of all my wonderful disciples there, so when I return to USA I shall certainly come there for some time. We shall be celebrating the Appearance Day in Mayapur this year form 25th to 29th February, and then I shall be returning to Bombay for the month of March to initiate construction of our first "Hare Krishna City" on a large plot of land we have purchased there. However, if for some reason I shall return to USA before then, I shall with great pleasure come to your festival at Berkeley. At least I will be present there with you all in spirit, as always, you may know that for certain. I like very much your idea for putting eight banners across the main road with the eight Sikshastak prayers written boldly. If the students and other people study these eight prayers carefully, they will be delivered to the highest perfection of life. Also, I thank Nalinikanta for his enclosure of $15 daksina.

I hope this will find you all in good health and transcendentally happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
