====== Sukadeva  ======

My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 15th February and have examined the contents with care. By your good recommendation I am pleased to accept Leroy Howes and David Joy as my initiated disciples. Their new names are: Paramatmananda Dasa and Pavaka Dasa. To save time and money, kindly forward two sets of japa beads to Kirtanananda Swami in New Vrndavana for the proper chanting, and then you may perform the fire sacrifice. Now they must always follow the regulated principles, such as 16 rounds at least each day, attending Mangala Arati, etc. and gradually they will come to the stage of spontaneously loving Krsna.

You also have my permission for the second initiation of Sikhandi dasi and you can obtain an initiation tape and instructions from Karandhar in Los Angeles. Now, keeping very clean, she must never break the regulated principles.

A pure devotee always thinks himself as not-devotee. That is a good attitude. If one thinks he is big devotee that is not good, thinking that he is first degree. We should not be puffed up, a devotee avoids it, remaining always in the second degree. A dog is a faithful servant. To become lowest dog is to become on the highest platform of service. Krsna has given everyone something extraordinary and to serve Krsna with one's extraordinary talent means successful life.

I hope this meets you in good health. Hare Krsna.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
