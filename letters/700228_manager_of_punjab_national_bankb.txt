Dear Sir:

Re: My savings fund account No. 2595

I beg to inform you that on 13 January, 1970, I advised your Vrindaban Branch to transfer Rs. 5,500 from my account there to my account with you as above mentioned.

Kindly let me know if you have received the money and credited it to my above account. Also please let me know what is the present balance.

Thanking you in anticipation of an early reply.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
