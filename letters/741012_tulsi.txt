====== Tulsi ======

Honolulu

My dear Tulsi devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. I see that after living in Brazil for some time, you are now living in Hawaii with your son Karnapura. You are right in saying that although Krishna consciousness is a simple process, the application may sometimes be difficult. Now you are one of my older disciples, so please try to follow the devotional practices I have given you. This is the simple formula for victory in our struggle against maya.

Recently I have visited our Gurukula school in Dallas, and I was quite satisfied how the boys and girls are being trained up to be ideal Vaisnavas. This training from an early age is important, and I also was fortunate to have received such training when I was a child. So why not send Karnapura to Dallas, and come yourself to stay here at Mayapur.

Karnapura is an intelligent boy, so give him opportunity, and he will become a pure devotee in this lifetime; and in Mayapur you can devote yourself to chanting Hare Krishna and studying our Krishna consciousness philosophy. Here it is very peaceful living, an open place, very nice. In this way your mind will gradually become controlled.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
