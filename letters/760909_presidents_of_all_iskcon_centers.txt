To the Presidents\\
__all-ISKCON Centers.__

Dear President,

This is to introduce Srimati Lalita Bose, who is our friend and well-wisher. Wherever in our centers she goes, she should be received free of boarding and lodging at least for three days.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
