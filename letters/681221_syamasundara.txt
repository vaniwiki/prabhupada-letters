====== Syamasundara ======

London

My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very encouraging letter of December 16, 1968 and I've noted the contents with great pleasure and hope.

It is understood from your letter that Mr. George Harrison has a little sympathy for our movement and if Krishna is actually satisfied on him surely he will be able to join with us in pushing on the Sankirtana Movement throughout the world. Somehow or other the Beatles have become the cynosure of the neighboring European countries and America also. He is attracted by our Sankirtana Party and if Mr. George Harrison takes the leading part in organizing a huge Sankirtana Party consisting of the Beatles and our Iskcon Boys surely we shall change the face of the world so much politically harassed by the maneuvers of the politicians. The people in general are in need of such movement. If Mr. George Harrison wants to benefit himself, his country and the people of the world I think that he must join this Krishna Consciousness movement with no hesitation. His proposal to offer us a five story building is very welcome. Actually we need such a nice building is very welcome. Actually we need such a nice building in London. People of the world take it very seriously. During the British period in India, anything which was trademarked, "made in London" was sold very quickly, so try to make your London Yatra equally important so that when the young boys and girls of England and America combine together in Sankirtana Party it will be a great revolution in the world, even in Russia and China. I shall be glad to hear from you further on this matter.

So far as our Hamburg center is concerned, the boy, Krishna Das is very sincere and intelligent boy. If you go for a week or so late January or early February it will be good suggestion. Regarding Hawaii, I was to go there immediately but the Sankirtana Party here led by Tamala Krishna has asked me to stay here at least for one month more. So I am immediately not going to Hawaii but I am always anxious to go to the London Yatra. I am very much hopeful when you say in your closing line, "soon we will have a temple, soon we will have a temple, soon we will have a temple." Thank you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. If you have serious engagement with Mr. George Harrison then don't move from London until your business is finished.\\
P.S. Have you any copies of Bhagavad-gita? If not then order from Brahmananda and present one hardbound copy to Mr. George Harrison with my compliments. He will be pleased to read it.
