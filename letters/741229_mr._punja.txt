My dear Mr. Punja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12th December, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully.

I think also that Vijayadhvaja das must not be very responsible if he has sold this van in his own name and appropriated that money to his own use. Therefore he should not be in charge there. Because you are eager to distribute my books and magazines and because you are chanting 16 rounds daily I think that you are trustworthy and qualified to be in charge there. So you can go ahead and register our Society there with taking all proper and necessary steps. Before the finalization of registration takes place I would request you to send me one copy of the constitution for our society there so I can approve it finally. My name should be there as the founder-acharya, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. I should have full authority in all matters. Vijoyadhvaja das can continue to preach there and kirtanas if he likes. But it is my desire that he leaves the management and handling of money and registration to your good self. He should be encouraged to help by being a strong preacher and attracting many devotees amongst the local men. As of now I do not know if I will be going to Fiji or not. I am thinking of leaving Bombay for London sometime in the beginning of January. Then I will be going from London to S. America.

You mention in your letter that you will be going to the United States and London in May or June. I may also be there at that time. Please keep me informed of the progress there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Please continue the distribution of my books and magazines as much as possible. This is very much pleasing to me. Thank you.
