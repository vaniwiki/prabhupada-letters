====== Bapi ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bapi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 21, 1973 and am glad to learn that you have immigration visa for U.S.A. valid until August 9, 1973. Your former letters I did not receive most probably because they have been missing me because of my extensive travelling. I have come from India to U.S.A. recently on April 1.

You can purchase immediately one membership ticket for ISKCON. It costs only Rs. 1111/-, and on this ticket you can stay in any temple for as many days as you like. So you can secure a membership ticket from our membership office at the following address: ISKCON, 66 Babar Road, Bengali Market, New Delhi.

When you come to New York, I shall advise the Temple Commander to receive you. As you have been granted visa, you can secure a job. I think you can get it easily because you are qualified. I shall advise my disciples to help you, but this will have to be arranged when you come here.

I am sorry to learn that your father cannot see at night. When our time is up, we have to push on even in broken condition of life.

At present I am in Los Angeles and most probably will be here during the month of August.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
