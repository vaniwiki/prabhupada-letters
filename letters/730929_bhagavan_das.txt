====== Bhagavan das ======

My dear Bhagavan das:

Please accept my blessings. Herewith please find one letter from Mr. Khilnani father of Anita, and the contents will speak for itself. I wish that the marriage will be suspended for the time being unless the father agrees to this marriage. According to the Vedic system marriage takes place according to the sanction of the parents, although this is not being followed strictly at the present moment.

So read this letter and do the needful so we may not create some disturbing marriage condition.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
