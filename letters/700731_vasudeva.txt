My dear Vasudeva,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from you since a long time. I hope everything is going well with you in Krsna consciousness.

I know that you have been practicing your painting in a regular schedule and you are very much enthusiastic to be engaged in this. You are not only advanced student in painting, but also in Krsna consciousness, so always pray to Krsna how you shall draw the painting and I think it will come out nice. My another request to you is that because I am going to the Eastern hemisphere countries I wish to establish as many branches as possible on that side. As you know me very well, I shall require many pictures of Pancatattva, either Sankirtana or Five standing together, also the pictures of Acaryas.

Wherever a Sankirtana Temple will be established, I shall require at least three pictures, namely your Spiritual Master, my Spiritual Master and Pancatattva as they are being worshiped in the first apartment of the Temple here in L.A. I shall have some color pictures of this first apartment of the L.A. Temple sent to you for reference. These pictures may be painted on a canvas with oil painting and when it is dried up they may be rolled all together and dispatched by Post Air Mail. The framework may be done locally. Paraffin paper may be placed between the paintings so they will not stick.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
