====== Letter to: Amarendra ======

Gainesville

My dear Amarendra dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 9-22-75 with enclosed Guru-daksina and I thank you very much.

On your recommendation I am accepting the following devotees for initiation:

1st. initiation: Robert Tarjan (Dronacaryaguru), Keith Consbruck (Manusrestha dasa)

2nd. initiation: Bhusaya das Brahmacari, Jagannatha Tirtha das Brahmacari, Ekadasi das Brahmacari, Mahaprabhu das Adhikari, and Jalangi devi dasi.

You will find enclosed 4 brahmana threads and you should perform fire-sacrifice for all of the new initiates stressing the responsibility involved. Everyone must follow the four regulative principles and chant minimum of 16 rounds japa daily. There is no question of falldown if one seriously follows these principles.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
