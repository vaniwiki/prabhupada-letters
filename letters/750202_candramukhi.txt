My dear Candramukhi devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. I am very happy to see that you are learning our philosophy so nicely. You will grow up to be a great devotee of Krishna. You are very fortunate to have the opportunity of attending Gurukula, so don't waste this opportunity. Take full advantage of it by always rising early, attending arati, classes and chanting at least 16 rounds daily without fail. These things will make you very strong in Krishna Consciousness. Thank you for appreciating my books. Read them carefully and you will preach very nicely.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
