====== Letter to: Jayatirtha ======

Dear Jayatirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 4, 1974.

It is very reassuring for me that all our most important affairs located in world headquarters in Los Angeles are being well cared for under the guidance of your good self, Bali Mardan and Ramesvara. Therefore I have not become disturbed on that account because I know the BBT, Negotiations with Dai Nippon and financial matters are being taken care of even though Karandhara has left his post. Your desire to give me relief from having to worry about these matters shows that you have understood my desires, and I thank you very much. It is nice that you have taken this occasion to impress on the devotees there the necessity to be very serious in executing regulative principles, otherwise we will surely fall away. One who sticks strictly to these principles, will not, however fall down. Your statement, "The residents of New Dvaraka are praying for your mercy" is very nice. Let us meet all at Mayapur and chalk out a years work for our great mission.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
