My dear Dr. Singh,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 23d March, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so pleased that you have taken my two young disciples, Vaikunthanatha and Saradia, from Trinidad for preaching work. It is so kind of you that you are appreciating their work in this connection. Kindly continue to help them so that there may not be any impediment in their preaching work.

I thank you very much for inviting me to go there. If it is Krishna's desire that a temple be built in Trinidad or Guyana, then I shall go there. I have received one letter from Dindayal of Guyana in this connection and if the two of you can work with Vaikunthanatha and Saradia for establishing one center, that will be very nice. So thank you once more for your kind invitation and when the temple is established, I shall go there as soon as possible.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
