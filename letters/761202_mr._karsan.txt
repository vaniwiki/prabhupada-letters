====== Mr. Karsan ======

Dear Mr. Karsan,

Please accept my blessings.

I have heard from Brahmananda Swami that you are organizing the purchase of the house in Mombassa that we want as Krishna's temple. All the blessings of Krishna are with you.

> na ca tasman manusyesu kaccin me priya-krttamah
> bhavita na ca me tasmad anyah priyataro bhuvi
> [[books:bg:18:69|(Bg. 18.69)]]

Anyone who preaches Bhagavad-gita is very dear to Krsna. So, you are helping this preaching. Certainly you'll be dear to Krsna. It is an open secret, anyone who helps spread Krsna consciousness becomes very dear to Krsna. Others are simply wasting time in the valuable human form of life.

Simply help to the best of your capacity. Krsna will be pleased to recognize you. Krsna is the root of everything. If He is pleased, everyone will be pleased. If you pour water on the root, the water will be distributed all over the tree. This is the best service to humanity.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
