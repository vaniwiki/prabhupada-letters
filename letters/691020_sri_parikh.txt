====== Sri Parikh ======

My dear Sri Parikh,

Please accept my greetings and blessings of Lord Krishna.

As you know that my mission is to spread Krishna Consciousness in the Western part of the World, I wish to establish one permanent Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in London. In this connection I beg to invite you in a meeting as follows for the purpose. Please join and encourage me.

Meeting on Monday the 27th day of October 1969 at 7:30 P.M.

Place: English speaking union Main Luncheon Room. 37 Charles Street West 1 near Berkeley Sq.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
