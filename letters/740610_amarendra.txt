====== Amarendra ======

Gainesville, Florida

My dear Amarendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6/6/74 and have carefully noted the contents.

I can understand that you want to run for political office, but we can not spend money even if we have money. If you have money of your own and you want to spend it for running for office you can do that. But for running we not only have to draw on the society's money but also on our men. This is not desirable. By competing with the politicians we may drop from our spiritual ideal. Our actual business is to become brahminical. We want to train some ksatriyas but that we can do in our own communities. Where is the money for this political work, that is my main question. And also, so much attention paid in this area is a diversion from our spiritual life.

Your every well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
