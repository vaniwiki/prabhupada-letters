My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of April 15, 1974 and I have noted the contents.

Regarding the $1,200 you have saved for contribution. You may send it to the Head Office of the Punjab National Bank, Parliamentary St., New Delhi, advising them to immediately transfer the exchange in rupees to their Vrindaban branch, in the name of the ISKCON Mayapur-Vrindaban Trust Account number 668 current account. I will personally see that it is spent in the best way.

I am asking Pradyumna to send you a list of Vaisnava functions which you can give to the Indians who are inquiring about it at the New York temple. Other than the bona fide Vaisnava functions we cannot divert our devotees' attention to such participation in so called religious functions. This has spoiled the Hindu religion into a hodge podge pseudo religion. For advancement in Krsna Consciousness we should simply concentrate on Krsna; therefore we can help them but the function has to be in connection with Krsna.

There is no question of a devotee becoming a sudra if he does certain work. No, a devotee is never a sudra. He is transcendental. Because their activity is done in transcendental loving service unto the Lord, it is all on the transcendental plane, __brahma bhuyaya kalpate__ [[books:bg:14:26|(Bg. 14.26)]]. You should not quit your present job, it is good service to Krsna. Although you may be working hard, you are always working for Krsna; so do not be confused about your position and never forget Krsna in any circumstances.

Your father came to see me recently in Bombay. He talked with me for hours and took prasadam and enjoyed. He looks strong and healthy and I think he is now cured. Henceforward you can send all contribution to the above trust fund.

I know you are doing your work for Krishna, so continue it, and send me information on how you are doing.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
