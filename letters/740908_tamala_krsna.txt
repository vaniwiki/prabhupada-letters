My dear Tamala Krishna Goswami;

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 4, 1974. Regarding my health, I was lying almost unconscious. Now by the grace of Krishna, I am walking in the morning but I am still very weak. Neither do I feel any proper appetite. So the weakness is there, but I feel that I am progressing a little each day. So your preaching work is very encouraging to me. You have got the proper field now. So continue with the cooperation of Visnujana Maharaja, so that your example can be followed by others.

Your program for distributing books and having the street festivals and then preaching and making devotees is very good. Also by teaching by your personal example and attending to the Deity worship is the most convincing. Example is better than precept. I am glad to note that the 24 hour kirtana was going on. It is by your chanting that I am now saved from the dangerous condition. It was very serious. Anyway regarding the constant 24 hour kirtana, you should not do anything impractical.

I thank you for sending the thousand dollars to the ISKCON food relief. We are using the moneys that have already been sent from USA in Mayapur for purchasing grains. In Bombay they also have a very nice prasada distribution program.

I have been receiving letters from Satsvarupa das Goswami about his successful library program so I think you also can take up this program in conjunction with your sankirtana festivals. Get standing orders for Srimad-Bhagavatam and Caitanya Caritamrta as many as possible. This is very good preaching work. So you may consult with Satsvarupa das Goswami and he can guide you in this program.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
