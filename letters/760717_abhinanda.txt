====== Letter to: Abhinanda ======

Mayapur

My dear Abhinanda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 7, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care. There is a great future for making standing orders in India undoubtedly. So now this program must go on very nicely and Krishna will give you all support. In Kuruksetra University, we gave some books to the Vice-chancellor. Please inquire what is their decision concerning taking books and standing order. Thank you very much for the enclosed reviews from the Indian scholars.

Hoping that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
