====== Gurudasa ======

To Gurudasa,

I have received your letter dated Feb. 12, and examined the contents. Please accept my blessings. Locks on the door, ask Gaurachand to help. I have just arranged to send him Rs. 50 per month for his lifetime and he will cooperate with us.

If you like to stay in my rooms at Radha Damodara then you may stay there. I allow it. Preaching also means reading and writing, or else what will you preach? If I do go to Manipur I still plan to go to Vrndavana afterward. My schedule is being planned as leaving for Manipur on the 8th March and staying utmost a week say until the 15th. So as the festival program in Vrndavana runs through the 22nd March, I will still be there during the festival.\\
N.B. You say you are on good terms with Madan Mohan Goswami. Under the circumstances take the whole house on rent from him. Although he is appealing to the court it will not stand. Better while the litigation goes on let him take money from us and let out the whole house to us. That will be his own gain. Whatever the court decides for the time being he can rent from us for the whole house. If you can induce him it is gain for him. Rent should be at the same rent as present.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
