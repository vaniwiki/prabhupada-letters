====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 26, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the letter to the draft board, I would like that you boys may decide among yourselves what is to be done. When you have decided amongst yourselves, send it to me and I shall sign. I understand that Tamala Krishna has contacted a lawyer in Los Angeles, so you may contact Tamala Krishna to see what he has learned.

Regarding my coming to New York next week, you may immediately send tickets from Los Angeles to New York for April 9, 1969. Murari will be coming to work as my attendant but as he already has a ticket, you need send tickets only for myself and for Purusottama.

I hope this will meet you all in good health, and I shall be happy to see you once again when I arrive on the 9th.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: If Purusottama's ticket is to be student fare, then please send him one student card and identification.
