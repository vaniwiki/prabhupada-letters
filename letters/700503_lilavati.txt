====== Letter to: Lilavati ======

London

My dear Lilavati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28th April, 1970, and the report of our Sankirtana Movement in London is very much encouraging.

I think each couple of our students may try to open a branch in England. Our first branch of London Yatra was opened by Mukunda, Gurudasa, and Syamasundara and their wives. They tried very hard, and now our London Temple is nicely situated. Similarly many other Temples can be opened in places like Amsterdam, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, etc. I have received report from Tamala that preaching in Paris is going nicely. In one day they recruited about 14 devotees simply by requesting who will join this Krsna Consciousness movement. So you all also recruit members, English boys and girls, in that way. Our Movement is a declaration of war against Maya, that you can understand very well, so we have to recruit many fighting soldiers---so do it vigorously.

I am glad to learn that the children are feeling very well in open atmosphere, so let them enjoy life for some time.

George has rendered some valuable service, so Syamasundara is trying to do some good to him. This is our duty, anyone who has rendered a little service to Krsna should be given all facilities to take it up seriously.

Regarding your question, Yes, Krsna is always increasing in so many ways, so there is no question of decrease. The verse in question stating that Krsna is devoid of increase and decrease is from Srimad-Bhagavatam and it is given with specific reference to the devotee. The purport is that if Krsna gives himself to any one of His devotees, although He is Purna or the Complete Whole, still there is no decrease in Him. Similarly we may give to Krsna everything, but still He is not increased.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
