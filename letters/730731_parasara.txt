====== Letter to: Parasara ======

Evanston, Illinois

My dear Parasara Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter and magazine.

Why should we endeavor separately to produce another magazine. Whatever articles are written by our students may be published in BTG by submitting them to the chief editor Satsvarupa Goswami Maharaja. BTG is especially meant to give some facility to our students, to train them to write articles on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness. Our energy should be concentrated on one thing at a time, not that everyone will start their own magazine wasting time money and manpower. Our BTG Is there and it is being distributed without financial risk, so submit articles and increase the pages of BTG and increase the distribution also. The temples have now enough literature, and besides that if you simply ask for a little contribution, no one will send.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
