====== Gargamuni ======

Evanston, Illinois

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 30, 1975 and have noted the contents. Go on preaching for now, so far money matters, that we shall see later. Preaching is our life. Follow strictly the principles, read, chant,---then there is success. And if you don't do this, spiritual strength is reduced. It is just like a snake is very powerful, so long he has got poison. If it has no poison, nobody cares for it. Similarly, this chanting, reading, and following the principles is our spiritual strength.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
