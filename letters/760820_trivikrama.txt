====== Letter to: Trivikrama ======

New York

My dear Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated July 29, 1976 and have noted the contents. Your idea of raising some funds and support in the West and then going back to Taiwan is a very good idea. Do it. This is a very good program. This is a very gentlemanly idea. Unless one has an office and a sitting place, no one really cares about you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
