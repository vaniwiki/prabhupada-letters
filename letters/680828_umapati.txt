====== Umapati ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Umapati,

Please accept my blessings. You will be glad to know that I am starting for New York on the 31st instant at 4:30 p.m., and reaching New York at 5:50. I wish to meet Satyavrata; if he does not like to come to our temple, then I wish to go there to his place. Please arrange for this sometimes on Sunday.

I hope you will remember my request to you about the press opening. The decision is now complete and now I am going to New York to arrange for it. Perhaps you have already known also about the land leasing for New Vrindaban attempted by Hayagriva Brahmacari and Kirtanananda Swami.

Hope this will meet you in good health, and more when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
