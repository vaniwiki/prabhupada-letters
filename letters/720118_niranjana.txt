====== Niranjana ======

Varanasi

My dear Niranjana das Brahmacari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of January 6 and 10, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I am very pleased that you are trying very determinedly for following the regulative principles of Vaisnava way of life, despite lack of association with devotees. So I think you should very quickly join us and thus take advantage of your propensity to perfect your life by taking up very seriously and full-time this Krishna Consciousness process, which is the recommended and most effective means in this Age to reach the highest platform of life. This has been proven practically all over the world.

I am going to Africa on the morning of 24th instant, and it is quite likely that I shall not be returning to India for some time, perhaps several months. So you can come here to Jaipur and meet me by the 21st latest for taking your initiation. Otherwise, it is also possible that I may return to Calcutta by mid-February provided the government allows my foreign disciples to enter Nadia District for celebrating Lord Caitanya's Appearance Day, and you can meet me there in mid-February if I come back.

I hope this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
