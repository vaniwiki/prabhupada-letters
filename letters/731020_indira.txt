====== Letter to: Indira ======

Florissant, Missouri

My dear Indira Dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24/9/73. Regarding your opening another school, if you can do it, I have no objection. But, it is a great responsibility. To open for a few days, and then close it is not good.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
