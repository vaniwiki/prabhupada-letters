====== Letter to: Cyavana ======

Santiago, Chile

Dear Cyavana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I was glad to receive your letter of 1 February, 1974.

It is very encouraging for me that you are preaching in Santiago, Chile and you are getting good reception from the student class. This is just according to the order of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and so He must be very pleased upon you for assisting me in spreading Hare Krsna to every town and village.

Please go on and try to establish something substantial there and develop it. Here at Mayapur we have had a GBC meeting and I have selected Hrdayananda Swami as GBC for South America. He will be coming there and can help you in making arrangements for the printing of books in Spanish. Always follow our principles and actively preach, and Krsna will always protect you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
