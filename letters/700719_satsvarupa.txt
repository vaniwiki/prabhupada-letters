====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. So far it is fixed up that I go to New Vrindaban for Janmastami day by the 20th August. So if you like I can go for a few days before to Boston to see your temple and press. You can fix up this program by talking with Hayagriva and let me know. I think everything is going nicely in Boston.

Offer my blessings to all the boys and girls.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
