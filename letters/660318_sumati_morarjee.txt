====== Sumati Morarjee ======

Madam Sumati Morarji Baisaheba,

Please accept my greeting and blessing of Lord Bala Krishna. I hope by the Grace of Lord Sri Krishna everything well with you.

Since I received your last letter of October 9, 1965, I was very much encouraged when you wrote to say "I feel that you should stay there till you fully recover from your illness and return only after you have completed your mission". I think these lines dictated by you are the words of Lord Bala Krishna expressed through your goodness.

You will be pleased to know that I have improved my health to the normal and my missionary work is nicely progressing. I hope my project to start a Temple of Sri Sri Radha Krishna in New York will also be realized by the Grace of the Lord. Sir Padampat Singhania of Kanpur J.K. Organization, has kindly agreed to construct a nice Temple of Sri Sri Radha Krishna in New York. I am trying to solve the exchange problem by all means and I am seeing some light for this purpose also.

Since I came down to New York from Butler Pennsylvania, I have rented the above room at $70.00 per month and I am delivering lectures on the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam accompanied by Sankirtana and the American ladies and gentlemen come to hear me. You will be surprised to know that they do not understand the language of the Sankirtana and yet they hear with attention. The movement which I have started here is completely new to them because the Americans are generally acquainted with the Indian Yoga gymnastics as it is performed by some Indian yogis here. They never heard of Bhakti cult or the Science of Krishna before and still they are hearing me,---this very idea is a great success for me.

Now I shall require some Sankirtana instruments from India and three men to assist me in my missionary activities. And if the Temple is started I have to bring many things from India and I wish that you may kindly arrange __for free conveyance of my men and goods in this connection.__

I have already asked one of my devotees in Calcutta to send two __mrdangas__ for Sankirtana and I have advised him to deposit the same with your manager in Calcutta for carriage to New York by any one of your ships. Kindly issue instructions to your Managers in Calcutta and Cochin to carry my things as abovementioned free and oblige.

In India when I started for America, your goodness promised to reply my letter regularly but I have not received replies for my two letters. Please therefore see that my letters addressed to you may be duly replied. I have come here in this old age neither for sight seeing nor for any personal interest. It is for the interest of the entire humanity that I am trying to implement the science of Krishna which will actually make them happy. So it is the duty of every devotees of Lord Krishna to help me by all means. Kindly reply this letter and oblige. Hope you are well. Kindly convey my good wishes to all your staff especially to Sarva Sriman Choksi, Nagarajam and Acarya. Thanking you once more,

Yours sincerely in the Service of the Lord.\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
