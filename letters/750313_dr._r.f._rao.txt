My dear Dr. Rao,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan 21, 1975 and have noted the contents. I had not received any letter from you until now, Svarupa Damodara das is in our Atlanta temple. The address is: 1287 Ponce de Leon Ave., N.E. Atlanta, Georgia 30306 U.S.A. I have asked Svarupa Damodara to write you and I gave him your address. He promised that he would immediately write a letter. I have just completed a world-wide tour visiting Hong Kong, Japan, U.S.A., South America and Mexico, London, and now I am in Tehran. Our center here is very nice. I will be leaving for Bombay on the 15th of March and then on to Calcutta on the 19th from there. This year, we will again celebrate the birth day of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in Mayapur on March 27th. All the devotees will be coming about a week early for doing parikrama of the different holy spots. About 400-500 devotees will again come this year. I would be happy to see you there if you are able to come.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
