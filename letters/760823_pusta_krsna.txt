====== Pusta Krsna ======

Berkeley

My dear Pusta Krsna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1976 and have noted the contents. Please send that Bhavan's Journal Manuscript to me in either Delhi or Vrndavana. It is approved by me if you want to sell the farm.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
