====== Arundhati ======

My dear Arundhati,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you so much for your letter dated February 13, 1969, and I have noted the contents with much pleasure. Your tears at kirtana are a good sign, and it shows that Krishna is pleased upon you. So remain in this status and chant nicely. You will see you will be more and more graced by His Lordship.

Your desire to serve me is very praiseworthy. But because I am the humble servant of Krishna I cannot accept any service on my account. So what I say you follow so you may advance in Krishna Consciousness. That is your service and I accept it on behalf of Krishna. This is a very good attitude, and your wish to serve me actually means to serve Krishna.

Now there is ample activities for you as the Radha-Krishna Murtis are installed in Boston temple. So under the direction of Satsvarupa try to help out in these activities as far as possible.

Please convey my blessings to your godbrothers and godsisters with you. I hope that this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
