====== Bhavananda ======

Calcutta

My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 16, 1973, with list of programs. They are very nice. But one thing is, all of these arrangements, whether they are going to receive us at each place or if we are just taking the place to put on our own program? From __their__ side we should be received, not just that we simply canvass to take their place for our own program. The Gaudiya Math invitation should not be accepted.

We shall reach Calcutta on 23rd morning, Indian Airlines Flight No. 129, as I think Syamasundara has already informed you by cable.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
