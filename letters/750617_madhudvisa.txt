====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

Melbourne

My dear Madhudvisa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 11, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding Ratha-yatra, we shall chose the most favorable time to hold our celebration. If for our preaching, it is going to be more beneficial to hold it in September, then you may do so.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am awaiting your report.
