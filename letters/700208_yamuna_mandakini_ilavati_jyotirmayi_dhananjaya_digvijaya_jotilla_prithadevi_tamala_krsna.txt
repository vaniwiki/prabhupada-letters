====== Yamuna, Mandakini, Ilavati, Jyotirmayi, Dhananjaya, Digvijaya, Jotilla, Prithadevi, Tamala Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Yamuna, Mandakini, Ilavati, Jyotirmayi, Dhananjaya, Digvijaya, Jotilla, Prithadevi, and Tamala,

Please accept my blessings: I am so much obliged for your loving presentation of sweets, balusai, handkerchief, painting, flower, simply wonderful, sacred thread, dhupa, and gopicandana, and I have immediately tasted all the preparations so nice and distributed them to the devotees of the Temple. I have offered the handkerchief and dhupa to Radha Krishna, and placed the picture on the wall. Please organize this Sankirtana Movement under the leadership of Tamala, Mukunda, Syamasundara, and Gurudasa and be happy.

Hope this will meet you all in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
