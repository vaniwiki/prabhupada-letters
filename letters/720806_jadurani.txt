====== Letter to: Jadurani ======

New York

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 22, 1972 and I have noted the contents. Regarding your questions, yes, there is water in the house under the Bindusarovara lake. Of course it is not possible for us to live there, but if you know the art, it is a science, it is as good as this house filled with air. We are living in an ocean of air, we can live in an ocean of water, it is a question of art. By mystic power everything can be done. As for the second question, generally the Lord is standing. Anyway it can be done, paint it like that. Even when it appears that the Lord is alone, it does not mean He is alone.

Brahmins are sometimes also Saivites, so you can paint Kasyapa Muni with Siva tilak as you have depicted. Varaha is fighting in the outer space and the rain of pus and blood and hair is coming down in the outer space. Just like we also change different bodies, similarly Brahma also changes his bodies. But exactly how to paint His bodies, that you have to ask Brahma, I cannot answer. You have seen so many bodies, you can paint like you have seen.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
