====== Mukunda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of Sept. 20, 1968, and it is very encouraging to note all the informations. I think Krishna will help you in all respects. And the credit of opening our London branch will go to the San Francisco boys, headed by you. Of course, the girls also share the credit undoubtedly. And I am always ready for going there as soon as you shall call me.

Regarding the bank affair: You write to say "We are expecting a letter from the Canadian Bank any day as to whether the money was credited back to your account." This means that you have not received the money, and you are arranging to get the money again credited in my account in the Canadian National Bank, at Montreal. But I have received one note from Hansadutta who says like this: "I went to your bank and checked into that 1655.00 for Syamasundara and the gentleman in charge of the affair said that is all taken care of and that by this time they have got that money in London." I cannot understand what is the real position, but I request you to open correspondence with Hansadutta and let me know conveniently what is the actual position. Hope you are well, and offer to Janaki my blessings, and all others also.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
