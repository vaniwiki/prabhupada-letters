My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two letters dated May 3, 1973, and have noted the contents with great pleasure.

I think by the grace of Krsna you are getting some glimpse of hope to keep in possession the Hare Krsna land for our missionary activities. The laurel of victory will be if we can get the whole land at a monthly rent of 1000rs, as you have stated. To pay 1000rs rent per month means to keep a fixed deposit in the bank about 1 lac 70,000 and the bank pays 7 1/2% interest per anum and if we keep some fixed deposit in a private fund like Mafatlal or Birla at 12% then we have to deposit say a little more than 1 lac of rs. If we can construct a temple and building without permission of the landlord that will be our greatest triumph. If such a law is inaugurated then it is to be supposed that it is Krsna's plan.

Then what about our temporary sheds? Can we get municipal permission to construct regular buildings in those vacant places? So if we can get municipal permission for constructing houses in those two places and if we can get municipal permission for constructing a temple then it will be a great boon or blessing of Lord Krsna.

I think we have occupied the land sometime in January 1971 so does it mean that we have occupied the land for more than two years? You have to do your best to same the land with heart and soul and you are an innocent devotee completely dedicated. I wish that you may be blessed with all success in this connection. I am expecting your cable in the matter of purchasing the flat.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. If we become the owner or tenant of the land by dint of the new act then does this mean that the Chhaganlal case is finished? Where is his claim? Because actually we are in possession, he is not in possession.\\
