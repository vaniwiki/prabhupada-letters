====== Dr. W.H. Wolf-Rottkay ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Dr. W.H. Wolf-Rottkay,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated September 27th and October 3, 1976, I have noted the contents carefully.

Regarding the scientists, we have entrusted our own three scientists namely Svarupa Damodara, Sadaputa, and Madhva and we leave the matter to them, we do not say anything ourselves, but are leaving it to them. But there are many common men who do not believe that they have gone to the moon planet. So as common men we can simply say, how can dust and rocks reflect so much of light as to illuminate the night, like the sun at day. It is simply bogus to say that the moon is full of dust and rocks. Such a beautiful soothing planet is full of dust and rock with no living beings there is simply unbelievable. You are a learned scholar, do you think it is believable that dust and rocks can illuminate the whole universe at night. It is so soothing and beautiful. I shall be very glad to receive further enlightenment in this connection from your good self.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
