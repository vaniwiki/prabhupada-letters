====== Satyabhama ======

New Vrndavana

My dear Satyabhama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 9th, 1970. Since I left the U.S.A. I am continuously travelling for the last three or four months and just yesterday evening I have come back from Amritsar to Bombay. I have noted your letter and your analytical study of Krsna consciousness is very nice.

Regarding Brahmananda, he is actually surrendered soul, but Maya is so strong that on account of association he has even fallen down. So these two things are always side by side---Maya and Krsna---Krsna is service and Maya is sense gratification, so every moment we are prone to be subjugated by either of them. Our duty is therefore to be very, very careful. The poison is personal ambition. So everyone has the chance, therefore one should not be complacent. Doubts may come about, but one should be firmly fixed up that there cannot be any doubt on the Spiritual Master or Krsna.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
