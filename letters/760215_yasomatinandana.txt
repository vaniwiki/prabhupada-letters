====== Letter to: Yasomatinandana ======

Ahmedabad

My dear Yasomatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12 February, 1976 and have noted the contents. I am very pleased with your monthly Bhagavata-Darsana. That is a solid program. Please continue it steadily. One thing is, you must be careful with the subscription books so that they are not counterfeit or used by cheaters. One man, Agarwal, was cheating us in Kota and is now captured and given to the police. Unless one is authorized no one should be given a receipt book. Therefore you must have printed on each receipt: "NO BEARER CHECK; NO CASH; ACCOUNT PAID CHECK ONLY---MAKE PAYABLE TO INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS ONLY."

Yes, I approve your distribution ideas, namely subscriber agents, news agents. The subscription drive is a solid program. And if you regularly publish and get registered, you can get a one or two paise charges (postal concession). All right, you may take advertisements. Go ahead and educate the public regarding our philosophy and ISKCON activities. Also in the future there are many cities such as Bombay, Surat, and Calcutta with large numbers of Gujaratis, you may arrange for getting subscriptions there. Gradually as you work there, you will get local men to join you.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
