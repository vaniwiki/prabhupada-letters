====== Letter to: Hrdayananda ======

Caracas

My dear Hrdayananda Gosvami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 21, 1975 and have noted the contents. Try everything to remain in that house in Mexico City. I like that house very much. The best thing to do in Guyana is to kick out Mr. Rama, but if it is not practical, then let him buy us another house of our choice for our use---at least as good as that house, if not better. Regarding registration in Guyana, you simply have to show in court how we are an international society, not for any particular creed, race, or nation. Show them that we are a cultural movement. You should not back away when things get difficult.

Regarding your spanish literature, I am very happy to hear that they are selling nicely. Now, print more and distribute more. Let me know what is the most suitable season for going to Brazil and I may go there. If you want to add Radha Krishna's name to the list of candidates for sannyasa, that is alright.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
