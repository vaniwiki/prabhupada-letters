====== Vamanadeva ======

St. Louis

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your ISKCON St. Louis Newsletter with enclosed note, dated 9th February, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear your program is steadily expanding in St. Louis and how you are regularly making university engagements and are being so well received. Actually these college students have all been misguided. Without Krishna Consciousness, all their book learning amounts to zero. Simply if they will add Krishna Consciousness to their curriculum all their endeavors will know perfection. So it is so important that we distribute our books, especially in the schools and colleges, because anyone who reads them is sure to become Krishna Conscious. So make your program in that way and Krishna will surely help you.

You have got so many Tulasi plants there. Very nice. So you can grow more. Is the climate suitable for growing? Hawaii is undoubtedly suitable but St. Louis also? Anyway, it is growing, and that is mother Tulasi's great favor.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
