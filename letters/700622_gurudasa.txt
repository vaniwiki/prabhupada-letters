My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12th June, 1970. The boy to be initiated (Thomas Hegerty) has not yet sent the beads, so I am expecting his beads as well as __diksa__ (Some donation).

Yes, if the Regent Park land is available, then we can try to raise funds to construct a nice temple.

I am so glad to hear that many new boys are coming to London temple and they are of good calibre intelligence and seriousness. Yes, this is a nice sign. If some intelligent persons join us, then our movement may advance swiftly. This is encouraging. But intelligence or no intelligence, if some way or other somebody comes and sticks to the principles automatically he becomes intelligent.

I have received one letter from Tamala that there is invitation from Africa. I will be glad to know about this. I shall send 25 copies of KRSNA on or before the Rathayatra. I wish that the selling of this important book be begun on this auspicious day. I have not heard for a long time either from Syamasundara or Mukunda, neither from their wives. But I am pleased that everything is going on nicely. That is alright.

I have informed Hansadutta that the five students in Hamburg who are now ready to receive Gayatri may do so when they visit your London temple during Rathayatra celebration. So I think you know all the procedures by now and you may give them the Gayatri as I have already prescribed by using the tape record of the mantras and performing the fire sacrifice.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
