====== Patita Uddharana ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Patita Uddharana das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 8, 1974 and have noted the contents. So in your letter you are not finding fault with anyone. So you are good Vaisnava. You do not find fault with anyone. This is the qualification. We should always think ourselves very humble and meek. This you must know.

So we have to all cooperate amongst ourselves, otherwise what will people think if we ourselves fight with one another? A devotee is always ideal in behavior.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
