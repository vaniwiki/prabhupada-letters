My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated July 30 and August 4, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very glad to hear that those boys have joined you, and I have also received one happy report from Daniel that he is living with you and he has no complaints, he is very happy. So you give Daniel all cooperation for expanding this movement in Mexico, he has got good energy and he is a very good soul. So far his asrama in Puerto Vallarta, we are not taking that place on lease or rent, only if he gives it to us can we manage. It is very nice place, and I want to come there for spending some time, but he has told me it is our ISKCON place so he should make good his promise and give it to Krishna, otherwise we shall not take it.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
