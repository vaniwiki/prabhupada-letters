====== Jayapataka ======

<card class="letter">
Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated Nov. 2 and nil.

If you can get concessional paper there that's alright. Do it.

Damodara Maharaja is a dangerous man. Remain very cautious with him. He is always causing difficulty.

Regarding the two men who have come to us from Gaudiya Math, for the time being we should try not to give shelter to such persons unless they are tested.

Regarding the Narayana Kavaca mantra, the Hare Krsna mantra is everything. But, I think that you are working too hard. Your illness is the result of too hard work. Remain in Mayapur. Take rest as much as necessary. And work through your assistants. And chant Hare Krsna.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
