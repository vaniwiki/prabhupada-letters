Dear Mohan Majumdar,

I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12/11/75 and have noted the contents. I can be seen during the Lord Caitanya birthday celebration in Sridhama Mayapur. That will be in March of 1976.

We cannot invest any money in any film industry. I am very glad to learn that you will soon be freed from all family responsibility and join our movement.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
