====== Gaurasundara ======

My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I have just today received your most recent letter of November 30th, 1968 and have noted the contents with pleasure. We have registered the Hawaii address given by you.

I am pleased with the progress that you, Mahapurusa, and Murari are making in establishing our Hawaii temple and also I have noted that you are making arrangements for accommodating me in January. You are making arrangements for me but also I think you should make arrangements for calling your wife. The husband and wife must live together for helping one another in developing Krishna Consciousness. So I think that you may write to your wife and request that she join you in your temple at Hawaii.

I thank you so much for your regular reports of progess you are making. I hope that this finds you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Your drawings on Prahlada Maharaja are being published in London papers regularly. It has %%____%% nice. I hope you have received the copy. ACB
