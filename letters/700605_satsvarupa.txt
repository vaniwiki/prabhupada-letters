====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your informative letter dated 2nd June, 1970. Thank you very much.

Try to deliver the tape recorder to Dinesh who is now in Washington again. So try to make some arrangement for this.

Hope this will meet you in good health. Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
