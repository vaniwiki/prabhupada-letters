====== Letter to: Bhurijana ======

My dear Bhurijana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter of September 4th, 1969, sent along with the Bhakti-sastri examinations and a maintenance check of 15 dollars. I have noted down your new temple address, and please try as far as possible to make this a very successful center. If you can get permission from the authorities for chanting and collecting on the streets, that will be a great boon to your activities. Please try for this wholeheartedly. Yes, when the schools are opened you must utilize this facility for presenting to the students of North Carolina how important and what a nice thing this Krishna Consciousness Movement is. All three of you there; yourself, Tosana Krishna and Vrindaban Candra are all very sincere souls, so surely Krishna will help you in your efforts to serve Him. Actually the work we are doing is not our work; it is Krishna's. So when He sees that we are working in sincere service mood, He is pleased to crown our efforts to please Him with success.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
