Vrindaban

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 27 and have carefully studied the contents.

Your letter is very welcome news, that all obstacles are cleared in the way of our building our temple at Vrindaban. Similarly in Bombay we have just been victorious over the party who had torn down our temple and the temple has been completely reconstructed in addition to our gaining overwhelming new popular support there.

So by your diligent work and devotion, all permission is secured and all materials are on hand. Let us pray to Krsna for speedy progress on the construction of our Krsna Balarama temple. Now many of our American and European devotees are coming to our temple in Mayapur and on completion of the Vrindaban temple we shall be able to give facilities to our ISKCON devotees all over the world to visit these two most holy places in the world.

Re. Madan Mohan Goswami, yes, we want to avoid litigation; as you have said the legal system is completely corrupt. But if he goes to the courts we shall be forced to go also.

Please offer my obeisances to your good wife Yamuna and thank her for her kind sentiments in Krsna Consciousness.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please change the plan of my quarters as suggested by Saurabha & Tamala both of whom just consulted me. I am going to London next Saturday 7th so when I come back next October I may live in Vrindaban in my new quarters. ACBS
