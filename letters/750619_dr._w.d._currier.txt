My dear Dr. Currier,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter dated June 16, 1975 and have noted the contents. If you are willing to offer your medical services to my students, when it is required, that will be very nice. It is important to keep the body fit and healthy so that we will not meet the obstacle of ill health while serving Krishna. Ill health may hinder one's service, so, we want to avoid it as much as possible. Enclosed herein is the question sheet sent by you, duly filled out by me for your information and signed by me. Thank you.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
