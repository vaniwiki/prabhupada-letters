My dear Ameyatma dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil together with photos of the paintings and card, and layout sketch. Regarding the two portrait paintings of myself you have done, both are nice but the close-up one is better.

Regarding the sketch of the Six Goswamis I think it is some imagination. Too much imagination is not good. It is better not to go beyond the limitations as described in the Sastras. What is that scaffolding? So better not to do this idea.

Regarding the painting of the arati ceremony, yes do it as it is described in the song. The ceremony was held inside. No arati takes place in the open. Lord Caitanya was a householder at the time. Navadvipa lila means householder lila. The form exhibited was the Panca-tattva form, as it is described: __dakhine nitaicand bame gadadhara.__ Not only are Brahma and Lord Siva but all demigods are offering. And, everyone has got sikhas, why you are asking if only Narahari and others have got? Srivasa was grhastha, and Advaita acharya was grhastha.

Regarding your suggestion for a big, big index, who will do the work?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
