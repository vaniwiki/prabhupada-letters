My dear Dr. W.H. Wolf-Rottkay,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 23, 1975.

Because your letter to Nairobi was a long letter I sent it to Svarupa Damodara, he is also one of my trusted disciples. I do not know why he has not replied it yet, and since I do not have a copy with me I am also unable to reply it.

How is the German translation work going on?

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
