====== Letter to: Nitai ======

Vrindaban

My dear Nitai,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 13rd January, 1976.

Please continue to work on the Arcana-paddhati and finish it. We can not be sure that Pradyumna will come in time. Also, you can go on translating the drama of Girish Ghosh. Everyone here has appreciated it. As you translate the scenes, there should be people rehearsing it.

In the syllabus of Nrsimha Vallabha Goswami, the Sankhya-karika must be by Kapiladeva, Devahuti putra. The other is atheistic. There are two sankhyas---theistic and atheistic. The Sanskrit in the Visnu Purana is even easier than in Raghu-vamsa. Yes, Bhagavad-gita As It Is should be studied from the beginning. There must be study from my books also. Whatever the syllabus you make up, the point is to somehow or other get recognition. The syllabus can always be changed later on. If we can get equivalency for our degrees that will be even better than affiliation. But whichever is possible that you should get. It is very important because as soon as we are recognized then our students will be able to come very easily.

As far as the Bhakti-sastri and other examinations are concerned, that we will discuss at the GBC meeting.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
