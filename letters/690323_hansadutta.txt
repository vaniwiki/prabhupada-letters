====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am duly in receipt of your letter of March 18, 1969, and I thank you very much for it. Yes, I have written Dayala Nitai in connection with the yoga magazine, and you can keep me informed on this matter. Please try to run on smoothly as is possible.

Yes, it is very good if you can chant 64 rounds; this is very nice if you can do it. But first of all we should not be disturbed by any circumstances. If you do become disturbed then this means you are still deficient in reaching the point. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that when Krishna is within our view, at that time one is not disturbed even in the midst of gravest calamity. Anyway, even if we are disturbed, then the only resort is to chant and concentrate one's mind in Krishna. There is no other alternative. Chanting and dancing make one relieved of all material burdens.

I am going to N.Y. on the 7th of April, so as you propose it will be a pleasure to see you there with your good wife. I hope this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. If possible Janardana may also see me at N.Y.
