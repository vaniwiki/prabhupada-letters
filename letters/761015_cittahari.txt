====== Cittahari ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Cittahari Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 28th September 1976.

It is your money so you can do with it whatever you like. If you feel the money is needed there, then use it accordingly, I have no objection.

Jita Garisa Das Brahmacari is duly accepted by me as a second initiated disciple. Hold a fire ceremony and let him hear the tape of the Gayatri mantra chanted by me through the right ear. See to it that he is properly trained up in brahminical habits, cleanliness, truthfulness, tolerance, self control, etc.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
