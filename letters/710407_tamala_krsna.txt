====== Tamala Krsna ======

Calcutta

My dear Tamala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I hope by this time you have safely reached Calcutta and are doing the needful. In Nasik Krsna has given us a nice offer; namely the host here Srimad Mahanta Deenabandhudas is offering his house and press in Vrndavana for our use. He is prepared to give both these things to us as a charitable gift. The problem is who will take charge of the house and press? But I think if Pradip and Rahul go there, things can be done, if not perfectly, still to our purpose. So please consult with them. Of course, there will be paid compositors in the press, but it requires good management.

We are returning to Bombay on Saturday by 12 Noon. I shall be glad to hear from you on this point as soon as possible. I am also writing in this connection to Ramananda and Durdaivanasan Prabhus in Gorakhpur and Ksirodakasayi in Delhi.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please inform me about Calcutta and Mayapur %%___%%\\
