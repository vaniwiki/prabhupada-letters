Dear Sri Giriji, 

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13th March, 1977. I am glad that you have appreciated the transcendental atmosphere of Sreedham Mayapur.

My architect-disciple has seen the Temple compound and has made plans how to improve it. Now you should make a draft of the Deed of Gift and send it to me. After our lawyer has checked that it is O.K., then you may a regular document and we shall immediately take up and begin the construction.

Thank you for enquiring about my health. It is gradually improving and I shall be leaving for Bombay on the 22nd instant. You can write me at our Bombay address; c/o ISKCON, Hare Krishna Land, Gandhi Gram Road, Juhu, Bombay 400054.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
