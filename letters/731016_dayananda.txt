My dear Dayananda Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 8, 1973 and have noted the contents. Regarding the older boys, they can do gardening engagement and other brahmacari engagements, study and manual work. And, as soon as they can read Sanskrit and English, they should read our books, such as Bhagavad-gita As It Is. By cleansing the temple and growing flowers their attention in this way be always in Krsna consciousness. That will save them from the clutches of maya.

> kaumara acaret prajno dharman bhagavatan iha
> durlabham manusam janma tad apy adhruvam arthadam
> [[books:sb:7:6:1|(SB 7.6.1)]]

"From the very beginning of childhood one should learn how to behave and practice Krsna consciousness, because this human form of life is very rare. . Although it is also perishable, it can give us the greatest boon; therefore we shall utilize this body from the very beginning of life."

Regarding your separating from Nandarani, nothing should be done artificially. Nandarani is not different from you. She also seeks Krsna consciousness. Your household life is not repugnant; it is favorable. . Do not separate artificially. When everyone is engaged in Krsna's service, there is no question of maya. I have got good estimation about Nandarani.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
