====== Hit Sharanji ======

My dear Hit Sharanji,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. DJT/, dated 21 February, 1970. In the meantime, I have sent you one reminder dated 24 February, 1970, in this connection. So as advised previously, I may again repeat the same that if Scindia Steam Navigation Co. has not as yet replied my letter or your letter, then the Murtis should be dispatched without delay by other freighters through the shipping agents Messrs. Cox and Kings. I shall arrange for clearing the goods at the destination.

I may once more give the following list for dispatch of the Murtis, and please note the corrected Boston address.

1 pair of Murtis to\\
ISKCON Temple\\
38 North Beacon Street\\
Boston, Massachusetts 02134 U.S.A.\\
1 Pair of Murtis\\
ISKCON Temple\\
3720 Park Avenue\\
Montreal 18, Quebec Canada\\
3 Pairs of Murtis to\\
ISKCON Temple\\
1975 South La Cienega Blvd.\\
Los Angeles, California 90034 U.S.A.

I hope by this time Syt. J. Dalmia has come back from South India. I am sending by separate air mail one copy of my new publication, Sri Isopanisad, as my complimentary present to Sethji. Please acknowledge receipt.

By the by, I may inform you that we require many pairs of Deities, but the Vrindaban manufacturer, Ramnath murtikar, is very slow. Under the circumstances, I would prefer ready made marble Murtis from Jaipur. One gentleman, Mr. Goyl, donated our London Deities---42 inches high Krsna and Radharani proportionately shorter. The photograph of London Murti is sent herewith. Will you kindly take the trouble to find out someone in Jaipur who can supply us such Murtis regularly.

So I shall be glad to hear from you in this connection. Thanking you in anticipation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. We have sent our representative to Australia, one Brahmacari and one householder, for preaching work, and the first installment of newspaper cutting is sent herewith. Please present it to Sethji. A.C. B.
