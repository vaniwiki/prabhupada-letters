====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 13, 1972, and with great satisfaction I note that you are becoming very happy and satisfied in your duties there in Australia. Now go on like this, preaching widely all over South Pacific Zone, and holding sankirtana assembly. One thing, I am going to Philippine Islands by 11th October on my way to India and I shall remain in Manila for three days. I think that you may come to meet me there and we shall discuss everything at that time. While you are in Philippines you can see how things are going there and then go to Hong Kong and other places in your zone for making inspection. Bhurijana and his wife I have also invited to meet me in Philippines.

So far Mohanananda is concerned, I have asked him to go to Bogota, Colombia, South America, for helping Hanuman open one center there. I think that would be his good engagement as he is expert in opening centers.

I am very much pleased to hear that you are distributing so much of our literature and books and I think if you go on like this that very soon you will become the number one book distributers in the whole world. At least I want that. I have already advised Caru in the matter of the legal business in Sydney, and I do not think there is any need for going to court and spending so much money. We are prepared to hold sankirtana on the street or in the jail, it does not matter, wherever we are, we are able to vibrate Krsna's name and be happy. So gradually they will grow tired of persecuting us and just like in London and other places we shall become established with our sankirtana party.

As Caru has recommended, I am very glad to accept Rajgana and Devi Darsana for second initiation. Enclosed find two threads, duly chanted by me, and two copies of Gayatri mantra. Now hold the fire yajna and distribute the Gayatri mantras and instruct them how to chant on the finger divisions. They should hear the tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra into the right ear and the ceremony shall be held only in the association of devotees. I am enclosing one copy of Gayatri mantra tape herewith, as you have requested.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
