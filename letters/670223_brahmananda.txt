====== Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I hope this time you have received the goods from India Jaladuta in good condition.

Out of the goods, you keep __one Mrdanga and six pairs of cymbals__ there at New York and all the balance goods including all the papers or letters therein may be sent here at once. They are arranging kirtana programme at different places and I think the Mrdanga and cymbals will increase the dignity of kirtana.

For the Mrdangas, I personally paid to India. So later as we shall see what is the actual expenditure.

Ranchor has given a packing instruction. Please see that the packing is __nicely__ done as instructed and as illustration is given there. Hope you are all well and with my blessings for all!

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Yesterday I have sent 3 tapes. Ask Satsvarupa to do the needful.
