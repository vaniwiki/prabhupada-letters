====== Satyabhama, Paramananda ======

<card class="letter">
New Vrindaban

My dear Satyabhama and Paramananda:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents carefully. If Kirtanananda Maharaja speaks what I speak, then he can be taken a siksa guru. __Guru sastra sadhu.__ The spiritual master is one, that is a fact. Kirtanananda Swami may be taken a sadhu not spiritual master, or as instructor guru. I don't think he is saying anything against our principles, so what is the wrong?

You have written that the devotees here say that you cannot know me, but only Kirtanananda Maharaja can know me. But, if Kirtanananda is a disciple and he can know me, and you are also a disciple, why you cannot know me? I have no objection to your taking Kirtanananda's instruction. There is no harm in going through Kirtanananda.

You are both old disciples, so why you should be feeling any difficulty?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
