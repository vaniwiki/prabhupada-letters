====== Bali-mardana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 23, 1970, and I am very glad that you have gone on to Singapore for expanding our number of Far Eastern and Pacific branches of ISKCON. It is my ultimate desire that all the cities of the world have such centers for Krsna Consciousness and I am sure this will come about because it is the desire of Lord Caitanya.

I have also received encouraging reports from Sydney and Fiji. So long our students remain fixed up to the regulative principles without deviation they will be enthusiastic for spreading this sublime movement. Please keep close contact with the centers in your zone and see that everything is going on nicely. If you can travel from center to center conveniently, that is very good.

Regarding the two students in Sydney, I shall arrange to initiate them as soon as possible. I am very glad that Janne will soon be joining Bhurijana and they will open our branch in Hong Kong. This is the greatest service that you are all rendering in the matter of spreading Krsna Consciousness and Krsna and Caitanya Mahaprabhu will certainly bless you all my sincere students more and more in Krsna Consciousness.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
