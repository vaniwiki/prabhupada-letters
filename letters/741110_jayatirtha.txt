My dear Jayatirtha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your cable reading as follows: FIRST C.D. MATURED NOVEMBER SEVENTH 9858 DOLLARS INTEREST EARNED TRANSFERRED TO PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK VRINDABAN ALSO 8000 DOLLARS BBT LOAN FOR KITCHEN PROJECT MAYAPUR TRANSFERRED AMERICAN EXPRESS CALCUTTA -JAYATIRTHA.

So it is all right. I did not know it was a loan. In name money comes to India in loan but it is never repaid. In name there are so many loans, like to Spiritual Sky and now it is not being repaid. And everyone is taking loan from BBT. That is the only source of our income. But if everyone takes loan, then how can it go on?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
