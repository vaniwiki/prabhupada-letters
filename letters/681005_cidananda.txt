====== Cidananda ======

My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received acknowledgement of my letter dated 26th Sept., 1968, from Mr. S.S. Sethi, whom you saw. So I am replying him and the copy of the letter is enclosed, herewith. You can immediately go and see him and deliver the wrong passport, and take receipt signature on the copy of the letter. And keep the copy of the letter with the receipt signature, carefully.

Before delivering the wrong passport to Mr Sethi, you keep in your diary the number of the passport, the owner of the passport, and the issuing office etc., in your notebook. And after delivering the passbook to Mr. Sethi, please let me know what does he say. And I hope you will carry this nicely, and I shall be also glad to know how your San Francisco branch is going on. Here everything is all right; we hope we shall get very good response from the student community here, because one of the representatives of the student newspaper came to see me and there was nice discussion, and I hope a good report will come out.

I have not heard anything about the negotiation of the new temple house, and I shall be glad to hear about this from you. Hoping you are all well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
