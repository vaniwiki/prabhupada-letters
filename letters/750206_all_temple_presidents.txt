====== All Temple Presidents ======

__TO ALL TEMPLE PRESIDENTS__

My dear President,

Please accept my blessings. Recently in Germany the government, police and church have started heavy persecution against our movement by arrests, investigation, and blocking our monies in the bank. By unfair and slanderous newspaper and television propaganda, they have ruined our reputation and turned the general public against our movement. We cannot sit down and be idle. Even killing of our devotees has been attempted in Berlin by shooting. Hansadutta prabhu has formulated a plan for protesting at all German Embassies all over the world. This plan has my sanction. He will be contacting you in this connection. Please co-operate with him fully.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
