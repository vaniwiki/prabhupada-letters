====== Jyotirmayi ======

My dear Jyotirmayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 22nd, 1972. I am very glad to hear that you are assisting your good husband in the translating of our French literatures. After discussing the matter thoroughly, it will be the best plan if our foreign literatures such as French language literatures will be translated, composed, layed out and printed locally. This printing of foreign books so far from their country of distribution has not proved to be very practical. Harivilasa is complaining that the French people do not so much like our "Back to Godhead" as it is not suitable to the French taste. So I have appointed Bhagavan dasa adhikari to be the GBC representative for France zone and Mediterranean zone, so he shall be going there sometime this summer for taking charge of things, and I hope that you and your good husband will also go there to Paris and take charge of this French literature. If you cooperate with our French devotees in producing our French literatures very profusely, that will be the best plan. So far our question is concerned there are two possibilities. You may say that Krishna is God the Supreme Personality and that He is God the Supreme Person.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
