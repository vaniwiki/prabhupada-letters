====== Madhavananda ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Madhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. One of my disciples, Niranjana das Brahmacari, has won a scholarship to study in Glasgow, Scotland. Allow him to stay in our Temple and take prasadam there.

Hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
