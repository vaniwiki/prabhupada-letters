====== Gunagrahi ======

San Diego

My dear Gunagrahi das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 5, 1975. Your letter to the newspaper is nice. Upon your recommendation I accept for second initiation Sona puri devi dasi. Enclosed is the mantra sheet. Hold a fire sacrifice and let her hear the mantra from my recorded tape through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
