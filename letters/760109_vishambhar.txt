My dear Vishambhar,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter undated. I have received so many samples of translations from different persons. Most of them are not very good. Of all, I like the Goswami Nrsimha Vallabha. I want to settle terms with him.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
