====== Letter to: Pancananda ======

Denver

My dear Pancananda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 31, 1975 and have noted the contents. The problem that you are experiencing may have something to do with the drugs you were taking previous to joining our movement. Any way, you should try very sincerely to become a pure devotee of Krishna by following all of the four regulative principles and chanting at least 16 rounds daily, as well as rising early, attending mangala arati, attending classes, etc. By this simple method, you will be very strongly fixed in spiritual life and whatever problems you may have will seem insignificant. However, if you need medical attention, your temple president should make the necessary arrangement for your seeing a doctor.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
