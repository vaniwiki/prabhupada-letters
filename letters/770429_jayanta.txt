My dear Jayanta,

Please accept my blessings. I was very glad to hear from Brahmananda Swami that he had found you again.

When you came to Mayapur some years ago I was very pleased to meet you. I could understand immediately that you are a very intelligent young man and also a good devotee of Krsna. Of course maya is very strong, and sometimes she brings down even a good devotee. But it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita:

"api cet suduracaro\\
bhajate mam ananya-bhak\\
sadhur eva sa mantavyah\\
samyag vyavasito hi sah\\
ksipram bhavati dharmatma\\
sasvao-chantim nigacchati\\
kaunteya pratijanihi\\
na me bhaktah pranasyati"\\
\\
(Bhagavad-gita As It Is, \\
Chapter 9, texts 30-31)

("Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated. He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.")

So as you can see Krsna is very kind and He can forgive the occasional transgression of His devotee. Now you should once again [illegible] everything by taking part fully in Krsna consciousness. That will make you happy, your family happy, and everyone connected with you also happy, because Krsna will be pleased.

When you were in Mayapur we discussed your translating some of our books. Whether you can still do this? If you can it will be a great service to all of the people of your country. Assist Brahmananda Swami as much as you can, and spread Krsna consciousness to all of your countrymen. This is my request.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
