Varanasi

My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. Yes, if I go to Delhi, then on your request I shall go to visit your father without fail. For the time being there are plans for me to go to Russia. When I go there, it may be via Delhi. If so, then I will step down and see your father also.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
