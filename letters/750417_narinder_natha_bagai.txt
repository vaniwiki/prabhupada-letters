My dear Mr. Bagai,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 28-3-75 and have noted the contents. Our book shipping department in Bombay is being improved, so I hope you shall receive your books soon. Regarding your taking sannyasa, first, you must come and live with us for some time and then we shall see.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
