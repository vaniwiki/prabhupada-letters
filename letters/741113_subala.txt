====== Subala ======

Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Subaladas Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 23, 1974 and have noted the contents with much joy. You have done something tangible, and I am pleased that you are simply carrying out my order without any consideration of your self-interest. This is wanted for progress in spiritual life. So as you have pleased me, you should take it that you have pleased Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is for this I have given you sannyasa, to be prepared to go anywhere on my order and preach sincerely and purely without any other consideration. So I thank you very much in this regard.

Cooperate with Mr. Punja, and chant Hare Krishna and distribute prasadam for the time being. This should be your program. When we get sincere devotees, trained up brahmanas, we shall install Deity there, not before then. It is good that you are getting men from Australia to assist you. Most probably I will be going to Hawaii in mid December, so if you like we can go to Fiji also.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
