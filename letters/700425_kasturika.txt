====== Kasturika ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Daughter Kasturikadevi Dasi (Janet Armano),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13th April, 1970, and now I have just received your new set of beads. Thank you very much for your nice letter.

I am very happy to accept you as my disciple, and your initiated name is Kasturika Dasi. I am very glad to know that you have been recommended for initiation by Sriman Rishi Kumar, and now please continue to follow strictly the four regulative principles of no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no taking of intoxicants including coffee, tea and tobacco, no illicit sex-life, and no gambling. Be sure to always chant daily your sixteen rounds on your beads, and be happy in Krishna Consciousness.

I am very pleased also to note your nice attitude of humbleness in the service of the Lord, this is a very important qualification of a devotee. Now try to learn our philosophy very nicely with the help of your elder God brothers and sisters, go on Samkirtan, and always be engaged in some kind of Krishna work, then Krishna will bless you to advance more and more in Krishna Consciousness.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Kasturika is the name of one of the Gopis, associates of Krishna. And you are Kasturika Dasi or the maid servant of Kasturika by name.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
