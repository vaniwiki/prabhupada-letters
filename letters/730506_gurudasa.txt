<card class="letter">
Vrndavana

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 25 April, 1973 and I am very much pleased to have the report of activities in Vrndavana. Kindly send me such report at least twice in a month.

Both you and your wife desired to go to Vrndavana some four to five years ago while you were in San Francisco and because you were so much sincerely eager, Krsna has given you very good opportunity to stay there and construct a very nice temple for Krsna and Balarama. Take this opportunity seriously, and as you have stated that you are feeling advancement in Krsna Consciousness, I wish both you, husband and wife, will go on increasing such consciousness more and more and thus be benefited.

Offer My thanks to Yamuna for her note in your letter under reply. Hoping this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

I am very glad to know that Ananda Prabhu is staying with you. Please offer my dandabats. He is my old god brother. Sincere Vaisnava. Please treat him like your father. Do remain in full cooperation. ACBS\\
