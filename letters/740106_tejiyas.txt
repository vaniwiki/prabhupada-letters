====== Tejiyas ======

Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. As informed to you in my letter last, I beg to inform you further that I plan to send to India $100,000 for completing our Vrndavana scheme as soon as possible, before Janmastami ceremony. Out of this $100,000 our two sannyasis, Gurukrpa Maharaja and Yasodanandana Maharaja have collected $40,000 and the balance Karandhara will arrange to supply even by taking a loan from the bank. The idea is we must finish Vrndavana temple construction work on or before Janmastami ceremony. There is another three lacs promised by Asoka Birla of Bombay.

So I am reaching India by the 1st week of February. But if you can open the account in the meantime then send me the reply of the bank to my letter enclosed herewith and the number of the account, then immediately money will be dispatched.

My program is that I am going to Hawaii January 14th and from there I may visit some other place or may stay at Hawaii and finish all programs by the end of January. So I shall be ready by the first week of February in India. You may send your reply to me at Hawaii and a copy may be sent to Karandhara in Los Angeles. In case I do not receive your reply before my departure, I shall leave instructions with Karandhara for dispatching the money. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
