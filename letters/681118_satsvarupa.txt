====== Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Nov. 16, 1968, and it is very encouraging that Devananda is combating with Mr. Jarvis representing Maharishi Mahesa. Yes, in each and every such meeting you should go and challenge these persons, but you must be equipped very strongly with conclusions of the Bhagavad-gita. In the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that the first class yogi is he who has in his heart always the eternal form of Krishna. I could not follow what Devananda said to the Jerry Jarvis when he said that he was also worshiping Krishna. It is very good to argue with him even at the suspension of meetings, and it is very good enthusiasm.

Your question, "Is it to be understood that once the yogi sees the Narayana Form, his desires for travel and material perfections cease? (as did the desires of Dhruva Maharaja) Or do the yogis still persist in desiring to do wonders even after seeing Narayana Form? You say, in your essay, __Super Consciousness,__ that the topmost is to see Narayana Form and take dictation. In short the question is, is it true that the yogi who is travelling to planets and performing siddhis---has never seen Narayana?" The example of Dhruva Maharaja, he was a devotee. The yogis are not devotees. They are more or less after some material perfection. But generally one who sees Narayana, he becomes a devotee. And sometimes such devotee before entering the Supreme Abode of Krishna or Narayana, they want to see some of the wonders of this material world. Just like I have come to your country, and I have no interest for sight seeing, but my main business is preaching Krishna Consciousness, but still, when I go to a new place, sometimes devotees take me to some important sight seeing place. Similarly, a yogi after becoming a devotee sometimes go to other planets also and Narayana fulfills such material desires. In other words, a devotee even if he wants to fulfill some material desires, he is given the chance by the Lord, but a pure devotee in higher status does not desire like that. They do not care for any siddhis.

I am glad to learn that Jadurani is feeling a little better and I hope you will take proper care fore the girl. I understand that Govinda dasi has recommended Jadurani to take Iron pills and almost all the girls here are taking them. It is compensating the deficiency due to their past habit of meat taking. This is a good recommendation and I hope Jadurani is trying to follow it. Here it is understood that Nandarani, Syama dasi, and others, as well as Govinda dasi are feeling better from taking iron medicine.

I hope also you have received my tape and are doing the needful. Hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
