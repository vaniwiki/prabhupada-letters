My dear Gurudasa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 21, 1975 and have noted the contents with much pleasure. So I thank you very much because I see you are doing very good. Now you are doing something. So you should continue in this way. Do practical solid work. This is required. You are an old experienced devotee and I have personally trained you in so many things, so now it is your responsibility to train others otherwise what is the meaning of my training you? So do it with sincerity and know that Caitanya Mahaprabhu, He will give you all facility and you will be a success.

This preaching and managing of the sankirtana parties is our real business. Do it more and Krsna will bless you more and more. It is very good that they are paying something for the lectures.

Upon your recommendation I am accepting for brahminical initiation Locasvara das. Enclosed is his sanctified gayatri thread and also the mantra sheet. I also accept for initiation Chris Nell and hs spiritual name is Srutisagara das. His beads may be chanted on by Tamala Krsna Gosvami. A fire sacrifice should be held so the brahminical initiate can hear the mantra through the right ear from my recorded tape. You should impress upon them of the responsibility for following the rules and regulations and chanting 16 rounds minimum each day. This will save them from __maya.__ No, there is no special name for your Gaura-Nitai Deities.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
