====== Babhru ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Babhru,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 8th along with the $20.00 Guru daksina.

It is a fact that at this time I do not want to open any further Centers. It is a question of timing. We have initiated so many projects and Centers and practically we are short handed all over the world, so it is better at this time if we work to maintain and develop whatever we have.

That Gaurasundara and Siddha-svarupa have sold the Temple in Hawaii and abandoned the beautiful Tulasi plants there is a great fall down on their parts. They did not ask my permission. If they wanted to go away they could have, but they had no right to sell the Temple. It is actually a criminal act on their part. Anyone who follows them will also fall down without a doubt.

Now, we have by Krsna's Grace built up something significant in the shape of this ISKCON and we are all one family. Sometimes there may be disagreement and quarrel but we should not go away. These inebrieties can be adjusted by the cooperative spirit, tolerance and maturity so I request you to kindly remain in the association of our devotees and work together. The test of our actual dedication and sincerity to serve the Spiritual Master will be in this mutual cooperative spirit to push on this Movement and not make factions and deviate. Try to convince Gaurasundara and Siddha-svarupa to return to ISKCON and let us forget whatever has happened in the past.

Yes, you may return to Hawaii with Sudama Maharaja and take charge of caring for Tulasi devi there. I cannot understand how Govinda dasi could abandon Tulasi devi. Kindly try to induce her to return.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
