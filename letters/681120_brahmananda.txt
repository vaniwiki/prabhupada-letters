====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of the 17th of Nov., and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, get the books from Japan as soon as possible, and I have also written them one letter which you will find enclosed herewith. They have agreed to gold print on the cover, that is all right. So get it as soon as possible. I think the binding is all right. So not delay, just try to get them as soon as possible.

Regarding Uddhava, I am very glad that he is going to marry Lilasukha. She is a very nice girl. I approve. They can wait and finish school as her mother desires. But they can become betrothed, engaged, now.

Find out whether Umapati can translate Back To Godhead into French language. He knows French language. Or any other boy or girl who can help in translating Back To Godhead into French.

It is very nice that you shall speak on this at the yoga group program. Subala should read carefully that Hatha yoga received in the Bhagavad-gita is very difficult in this age. Yoga system is approved, but nobody can follow the rules and regulations strictly, neither there is suitable place for executing it, and everyone is always full of anxiety, so how they can concentrate? So best thing is to chant Hare Krishna which is forced meditation. In this way make nice speech, and conclude with declaring that the topmost yogi is he who surrenders to Krishna, and worships Krishna with all thoughts, activities, and intelligence.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
