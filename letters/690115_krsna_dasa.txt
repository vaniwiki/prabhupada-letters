====== Krsna dasa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 8, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully.

The statue which you have received is not Visnu Murti. Visnu Murti is never to be found in fighting spirit with anyone. When the Lord incarnates within this material world, He does not come in Visnu Murti. Lord Nrsimhadeva although Visnu Himself, fighting with the demon Hiranyakasipu, although He is Krishna, He is different from Visnu Murti. So I think that the Murti which you have got is not Visnu Murti, but it appears to be a Murti of Lord Siva. Anyway, this Murti is not worshipable by us. In our temple we shall always worship Radha Krishna Murti or Lord Jagannatha. If possible, you can sell this Murti to some antique store and get some profit.

Regarding the press, it is a very good engagement provided you can work properly on it. But if you purchase such press and there is nobody to work it, it will lie down idle, and that is not good. So if you are serious about working on a press, I advise you to do it immediately. Otherwise you should not waste your time.

Regarding Jaya Govinda, settle up with him by correspondence. I think that if you send him passage money he will bring in exchange some goods from India. That is not a bad proposal because an exchange is not robbery.

Regarding Sivananda, I am glad that he is doing nicely and improving in health. I am sending him herewith one note. I am glad that you have already ordered __Bhagavad-gita__ copies from Brahmananda. Please try to introduce our books and literature as far as possible. Please write to me at least once in a week to inform me about your activities. I hope you will keep in touch with the news from London. They are very encouraging and hopeful.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
