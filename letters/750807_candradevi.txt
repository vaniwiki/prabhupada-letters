My dear Candradevi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. It is a very good idea that you have to be more attached to the Deities above marriage. But, it is not good to live at home because there is where meat is eaten. That will be offensive, so how can you worship the Deity under such circumstances. If your whole family become devotees, then that is another thing.

Actually I think that you can move from the Lord Jagannatha Deities to the Gaura Nitai Deities if that is your desire. That will be best.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
