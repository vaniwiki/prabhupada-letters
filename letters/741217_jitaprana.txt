My dear Jitaprana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10/10/74, and have noted the contents.

Your desire for leading a sankirtana party, preaching and travelling is a very good one and I suggest that you talk to your temple president or GBC and try to arrange such a program if it is possible. If we sincerely try to serve Krsna then He will give you the ability and the facilities. So please continue your service with great enthusiasm and follow strictly all of our principles and regulations. This is the way to spread our Krsna Consciousness movement, the mission of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. First of all one must become spiritually strong by following these basic principles staunchly and by learning our philosophy fully. Then his preaching will be very potent and many many people will become attracted.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
