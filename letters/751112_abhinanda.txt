My dear Abhinanda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 18, 1975. Yes, this is very good that you have taken seriously our programs here in India such as the book distributing. This is very important. It is a very good idea for the Seattle temple to finance the purchase of a vehicle as well as monthly finances for travel and maintaining and operating expenses of the vehicle. So you can take a leading part in this program. In your party here you can take some Indian devotees. That will be very effective.

So you should take from there an entry visa. You apply for one or two year entry visa, saying that you are student of ISKCON and you are coming to India to study the Vedic culture, live in our temples, and learn Deity worship. If you come all with an entry visa, then there will be no difficulty for you to renew.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
