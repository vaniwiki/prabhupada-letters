====== Letter to: Bali-mardana ======

My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Sept. 17th, 1970. In the meantime I have also replied your last letter in which I have informed you that if you take more interest in preaching work absolutely, you may be relieved from the Governing Body Commission.

Regarding a branch in the Fiji Islands, if you can open immediately a center in the very near future I will be able to send some Hindi knowing Indians to assist the preaching work there. I know in Fiji Islands there are many Hindus and one of them asked me to open a center there. His address is as follows:

Babu Ram Sharma

P.O. Box 267

Ba

Fiji Islands

I have just received one letter from Nayanabhirama and he has met one Indian gentleman who lives in Taiwan and would like us to open a center there. His address is as follows:

Navin Gajjar, Mgr. Du Pont Far East Inc.

703, Chia Hsin Bldg, Taipei, Taiwan

You should immediately contact Nayanabhirama about this prospect. Anyone who goes to Fiji must contact Mr. Sharma and amongst others he will be a nice friend.

Yes, in Calcutta we are getting good coverage practically every day and in every meeting the slide show makes the whole thing very impressive. So anyone coming from L.A. cannot only bring my UHER recorder from Karandhara but also slides and specially nice pictures as well as some large posters of your Spiritual Master and Lord Caitanya.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
