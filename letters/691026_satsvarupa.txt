====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 22, 1969. I have duly made corrections on the Isopanisad glossary you had enclosed, and I shall send it to Brahmananda as requested by you. I want that in all of our books, magazines and other writings the scholarly presentation be given in all instances, so for every Sanskrit word there must be the appropriate spelling and diacritic marks. Regarding your question about BTG containing more than one essay by me in certain issues, you may use your own judgement in this connection. Enclosed is a tape for __Krsna,__ and at the part on this tape where Kamsa is killed, that is the end of the first volume of __Krsna.__ The remaining portion shall be published as the second volume. Now we must make arrangements for its publication. Please consult with Advaita as to the price for 10,000 copies on the style of __TLC.__ There will be approximately 350 printed pages and 50 pages of paintings. So combinedly you determine what the production costs will be and let me know your figures. Regarding your final question, you are correct that __Garbhodakasayi Visnu__ and __Karanodakasayi Visnu__ are not divisions of Paramatma. So you may change the words "divided into" into "is one of". I am so pleased to learn that already the press is ready to begin printing some Krsna Consciousness booklet, and please keep me informed on your progress.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
