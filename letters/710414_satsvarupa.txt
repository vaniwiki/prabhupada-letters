====== Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. One of our life members here in India, and our good patron as well, has requested some back issues of BTG. So please send him as many back issues as are available, and if there are none there, then you may instruct Karandhara to do the same. Otherwise just you send some; not that both send. His name and address is as follows:

Sri Mulchand Deomal

Dedi Bathena Bldg,

Palia Street, Nanpura

Surat, INDIA

My program here is not yet fixed up so it is uncertain when I shall be returning to U.S.A. Presently arrangements are being made for me to go to Australia, Malaysia and Moscow, Russia as well. I have received one invitation to speak at the university there. So we shall see what Krishna desires.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
