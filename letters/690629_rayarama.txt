====== Rayarama ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 26, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding __Nectar of Devotion,__ the balance tapes will be completed today, and he is going to send you the copies by Tuesday. Regarding __BTG,__ I shall be glad to know the subject matters you have inserted in the issue #27. There are two important articles lying with Hayagriva: one interview talks with Ginsberg, and my old homage address to my Guru Maharaja. I think you already have this last one. These are to be published, along with pictures, as many as possible, of our Sankirtana activities and descriptions. From your statement, it appears that you do not expect to do anything with __BTG__ after #29, because it is in the hands of he (Brahmananda). I cannot follow what you mean by this. Everything is Krishna's business. It is not my business, nor Brahmananda's, nor Hayagriva's. It is the business of Krishna, and we want to serve Him in the best way. I wanted to save the monthly expenditure of $600 for some other business, but that does not mean that you shall cease to work as one of the editors of __BTG.__ You say that much of your time will be engaged in earning money, but that does not mean you have to cease your service to Krishna. You are praying for Krishna's blessings in order to serve me better, but when Krishna speaks through me, you hesitate to accept the words. I do not know why you should work at all if you want to remain brahmacari. Here is an ideal brahmacari with me. He works day and night with me. Why don't you become a brahmacari like him and come here? One who is a householder, he has to work because he has to maintain a wife and children at home. But for a brahmacari, why should he take the botheration of working simply for the matter of satisfying the belly? So far as belly satisfaction is concerned, that is already arranged by Krishna. Krishna is supplying food to the birds and beasts, so why should He not supply a brahmacari? Food is not a problem.

So my advice to you is that either you become a regular householder, giving 50% of your earnings to Krishna, 25% for family, and 25% for savings, or else you strictly follow the principles of brahmacari life. A brahmacari has nothing to do except serve his Spiritual Master. That is the injunction of the __Bhagavata.__ A brahmacari is supposed to work as a menial servant of the Spiritual Master, and whatever collection he gets, it becomes the Spiritual Master's property, not the brahmacari's. That is real brahmacari life. If a brahmacari earns money for his sense gratification, that is not brahmacari life. Better one should become householder and live peacefully. So far as work is concerned, you have got more than sufficient work with me. You have got a good qualification for editing literary works, and we have sufficient engagement for that purpose. Formerly, you were very much eager to transfer yourself from New York to Los Angeles because of considerations for your health. Now when I say that you may come here, there is a nice room for you, and work here day and night, I do not know what is the cause that you do not come. But still I request you that give up all other engagements, come here, and fully engage yourself in editorial work.

So far as eating is concerned, I don't think there will be any scarcity. I think this suggestion will be best for you, and you should come here at once. You say that your mind unfortunately runs away now and then. That is the business of the mind, but if you simply fix up your mind on the Lotus Feet of Krishna, the rascal mind cannot disturb you anymore. My Guru Maharaja used to say that just rise early in the morning and then kick the mind with a shoe one hundred times. Then while going to sleep, one should take a broomstick and strike the mind another hundred times. The mind is so restless, that it can be brought to tameness only by the process suggested by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. So you should try this process and stop the mind from running away now and then. If you follow the process of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, naturally He will help you in controlling the mind and bestow all His blessings upon you.

I thank you for your appreciation that you accept me on the superhuman platform and this will compel you to believe in God, etc. So if you are convinced about this fact, then I request you to come here immediately. And if you agree to come here, then you may bring some goods with you, which I shall list for you upon hearing your favorable reply. May Krishna bless you with good sense, and I hope surely He will do so. I beg to remain

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
