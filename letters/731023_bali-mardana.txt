====== Bali-mardana ======

New York

My dear Bali-mardana:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 12, 1973 and have noted the contents. I am glad to say that the Bombay business is almost completely finished. The land is purchased, and there were many opposing elements, but they are being satisfied, with the last one being satisfied today. Once this is carried out we are free from all obligation.

I have received the nice letter from your wife and the reply is enclosed herewith. Please deliver it to her. I would like to initiate your wife especially personally. So already she is chanting 16 rounds and that is nice. Still I shall hold a regular ceremony and initiate her along with you.

My program is to reach Los Angeles in the middle of December. I hope by that time your transaction of the New York temple will be finished. Regarding my coming to Japan, whenever is convenient is all right. I am prepared at any time.

Yes, I have received the $118,000 plus $25,000. Everything is received, cashed and spent. The land is in our full possession as proprietor. All bad elements have been eliminated. Now we must execute the building of the temple.

You can deposit daksina in my American Investment Account Bank Of America Branch #366, Culver City Account Number 8-80613.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
