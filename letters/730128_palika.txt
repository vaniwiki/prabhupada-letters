====== Palika ======

My dear Palika Devi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1/17/73 and have noted the contents with great care. You may be pleased to know that your husband has now taken sannyasa order of life for preaching the message of Lord Caitanya. Similarly you have gone alone to Hyderabad for pushing on the preaching work and I am very glad to hear that you have arrived safely.

Regarding the two girls from America, I have no objection to them coming to assist you if they agree. It would be good service for all of them, especially Kalindi has suffered some difficulty since her husband has taken sannyasa. But I know that you are very strong in Krsna Consciousness. So very strictly now maintain our principles by chanting 16 rounds on the beads, reading our books, working in every second of your life for serving Krsna. this sincere attitude will make you more and more advance and one day Krsna will reveal Himself to you face to face.\\
Hoping this finds you well and in happy mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
