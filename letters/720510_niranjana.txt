====== Letter to: Niranjana ======

Varanasi

My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. In your last letter you informed me that Dr. Rao (Ramananda das) had come to see you in Varanasi, but he could not find you at that time. Will you immediately open correspondence with him? His address is as follows: Dr. Ravindra Pratap Rao, Reader in Chemistry, Gorakhpur University, Gorakhpur, U. P., India. Just now I have received a report from Ksirodakasayi das of Vrindaban that Ramananda is not nowadays translating our literature into Hindi. You may know it from me that the idea of starting the Hindi paper generated when Ramananda took charge of taking the editorship of the paper. Now he is indirectly declining. I do not know what is the reason. Both Ksirodakasayi and Ramananda took charge of publishing the Hindi Back to Godhead "Bhagavata Darshan", but Ramananda has stopped translating, and Ksirodakasayi says that he is not a perfect translator. Another boy, Radharamana Goswami, he has left, so far I understand, so this is the position of the Hindi Back to Godhead. I shall be glad to know if you can translate our literature into Hindi with the help of some friends in Varanasi. Varanasi is the learning site for the Hindi language. Can you take charge of this translation work somehow or other? Then it will be a great service to the Lord. I shall be glad to hear from you immediately. Treat this letter as very urgent, and reply me by return post to our Los Angeles address.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
