====== Hitsaran Sharma ======

<card class="letter">
For starting the American branch of ISKCON I am corresponding with the Commissioner of Devastan Department, Rajasthan, Udaipur. I wanted to occupy the Jaipur House in Vrindaban. The last letter I have received from the Commissioner and the reply which I have sent to him, the copies are enclosed herewith; please try to have the Jaipur house at Vrindaban where we can conduct a branch of ISKCON in a scale just suitable for the purpose.

I have also received one letter of appreciation from Sri Hanuman Prasad Poddar. I think if you get a nice place at Krishna Janmabhumi Area (Mathura), these American students will be more enthusiastic. I have already written this fact to Bhaiji and I shall be glad if you also talk with him. The whole idea is full cooperation between the devotees of Krishna can build up a very great project for the good of all human race.

I shall be glad to hear from you with further enlightenment. Please begin the composing and printing work of Srimad Bhagavatam as soon as possible. In the meantime you may receive one letter from my student Sriman Brahmananda of New York. Kindly do the needful. Thanking you once more; hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. If we can start a nice branch in India, gradually the Indian youngsters, who are so much misled, may follow also the examples of the Americans in Krishna Consciousness.
