Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Parvati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents.

Thank you for your kind sentiments. You should try to become expert at making these nice milk products. The cow is the most wonderful animal and she is so beneficial for human society, giving so many gifts in the form of milk products. And you can turn all those milk products into wonderful preparations to offer to Radha-Krsna and thus your life will become perfect. Please continue advancing in Krsna Consciousness by this wonderful method; reading our books daily, chanting 16 rounds daily, following the regulative principles, rising early, etc. Thank you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
