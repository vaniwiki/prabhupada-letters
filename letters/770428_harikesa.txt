My dear Harikesa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 16th, 1977.

Do not be worried. I have written one letter to Radhavallabha telling the Press to immediately print all pending German books lying with them in Los Angeles. I have got all my blessings upon you so organize everything very nicely and see that we come out successful in this trial.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
