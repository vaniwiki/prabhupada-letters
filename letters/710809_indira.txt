====== Indira ======

St. Louis

My dear Indira,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good husband Vamanadeva Prabhu. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22nd June, 1971 and just now received by me here in London. I have noted the contents with great interest and especially the very encouraging photographs of your Tulasi Devi garden.

You are doing one of the best of services by cultivating Srimati Tulasi Devi so nicely. And she is growing so profusely. That is a sign that you are a great devotee because Tulasi Devi thrives on devotion. Thank you very much.

From Hawaii we cannot bring in Tulasi Devi but from St. Louis, she can be sent everywhere. That is very nice. So when you make a big profit what you will do with the money?

So you should induce other centers to cultivate Tulasi. One circular should be sent to every center that they should import Tulasi Devi from either St. Louis or Hawaii and at every offering of bhoga to the Deities there must be one Tulasi leaf on the plate. The leaves may be ordered from St. Louis or Hawaii and as soon as possible each center should arrange to care for Tulasi Devi nicely according to the instructions of you or Govinda Dasi who have both become expert.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
