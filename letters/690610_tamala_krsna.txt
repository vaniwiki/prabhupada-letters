====== Tamala Krsna ======

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 5, 1969, sent along with the article printed in the __Cosmos,__ and I have noted the contents in both of these items. The article was very nice, and I can appreciate how you are assimilating this Krishna philosophy and conveying it nicely to others. Your descriptions of the Dadhibhanda Celebration sounds very thrilling, and here in New Vrindaban there is also nice supply of butter, ghee, milk and cheese due to the cow that they are keeping here. Regarding the draft lawyer, please try to expedite the matter, because there are many of our boys who may take advantage of this facility of being excused from the draft service. So when you are able to arrange for this it will be a very important achievement for our society. Regarding your suggestions for my travel plans, your ideas are very nice, and if I do not go to London, you can expect me to come to Los Angeles directly from New Vrindaban by the 10th of July.

So I hope this will meet you in very good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
