My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 20, 1973.

I am happy to note that you are traveling and preaching, this process was also practiced by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in the beginning of his sannyasa life he traveled all over India for almost six years and my Guru Maharaja also traveled, and similarly I am also traveling. One thing is that I do not know how practical it is to carry deities in the truck, by the jarring of the vehicle there may be some damage and also I think that it is not possible to keep the top standard of worship, cleanliness, punctual offerings etc. We must be very careful about deity worship, if it is neglectful then it is very offensive and that will not help us, we should not do it simply for show. My suggestion is that all our buses should be outfitted with the picture of Guru Gauranga, that will be quite nice. Main business of traveling buses is to distribute books profusely, what do you think?

On your recommendation I accept Pat Hedmark as my duly initiated disciple and his name is Praghosa Das. For the second initiate I am enclosing 3 sacred threads and four Mantras. Hold a fire ceremony and distribute Prasadm generously.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
