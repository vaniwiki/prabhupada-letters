====== Letter to: Madhavananda ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Madhavananda Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 3, 1974 and also the juicer. Regarding the meeting you propose, you may arrange it, and I shall come. For Janmastami I am already engaged here, but your proposed meeting is very encouraging. So when you expect me, let me know, and I shall make my program. The Indians there have been cheated by so many rascal swamis who have come simply to collect money and then leave. So our work will be done locally.

Regarding the plans for the temple, I have just now spoken with Saurabha and you shall be getting the plans very soon.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
