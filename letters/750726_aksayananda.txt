My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated June 22, and July 3. So I am glad to know that you have had successful program in Kampoor. Yes, I think I remember Radha Krsna in Sadaf Agharwal from Kampoor. What was the name of his shop, is it a bottle shop? Yes, this traveling preaching program is a good idea. It is very nice, and you are a good preacher, so I am sure that you will do it nicely. It is a good idea also to train up other good preachers there in India. This is our need there.

Regarding the Madjar center, sending funds for the deity maintenance in Vrndaban, you are already collecting money, so it is not required that Madjar send money to Vrndaban. Rather the money in Madjar should be used for printing. Not that we should use all collected money for maintenance. Better to print books and distribute.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
