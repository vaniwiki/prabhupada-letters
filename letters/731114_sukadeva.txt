My dear Sukadeva dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 25, 1973 and have noted the contents. Regarding your going to other's meetings, yes, you can go to preach but do not pick a quarrel or have any violence. Try to attract the sincere devotees there.

Regarding the Gaudiya Math books being circulated there, who is distributing? Who is sending these books? The Gaudiya Math does not sell our books, why we should sell their books. Who has introduced these books? Let me know. These books should not at all be circulated in our Society. Bhakti Vilas Tirtha is very much antagonistic to our society and he has no clear conception of devotional service. He is contaminated. Anyway, who has introduced these books? You say that you would read only one book if that was all that I had written, so you teach others to do like that. You have very good determination.

Yes, you submit reports to me at least once in a month. Yes, I can come to Seattle, why not?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
