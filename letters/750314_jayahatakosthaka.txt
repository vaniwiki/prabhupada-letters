====== Jayahatakosthaka ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Jayahatakosthaka dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 10th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your going to Spain, if Hansadutta and Bhagavan think it is a good idea, then it is alright with me.

Your name means all glories to Krishna who performs the transcendental pastime of breaking into the storeroom (of butter).

Wherever you may go to perform your devotional service, you should always be very careful to observe very strictly the rules and regulations. Rise early, attend mangala arati and class, chant 16 rounds, and follow the four regulative principles without deviation. This will guarantee your spiritual perfection.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
