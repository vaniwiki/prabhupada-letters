====== Jadurani ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your recent (undated) letter. Regarding the painting of the Universal Form, yes you may do it as in the Brijabasi print.

You will be pleased to know that everything is going very nicely here, and we are having many meetings, almost every night, in various places with good notice. Daily our Sankirtana party goes down town where they are followed by hundreds of Indians. If we are only sincere, Krishna will give us all facility.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
