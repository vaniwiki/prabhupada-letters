Dear Murti das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 15th along with enclosed blueprints and have studied them.

Your proposed design for ISKCON-Manipur, a 10 Lak design requested by retired engineer Mr. Ramamoorthi, is a very opulent looking temple. I appreciate that you have worked hard at this.

I also have been thinking about Manipur, since my disciple Swarupa Damodar is arranging for me to go to Manipur about February 8th for a week. I am eager to preach there and think there will be good reception. I have given the Secunderbad address of Mr. Ramamoorthi to Swarupa Damodara. Perhaps you will want to be in contact with Mr. Ramamoorthi also. If he likes he can join us in Mayapur and go with us to our Manipur program. If Krsna desires, this temple you have designed may actually become ISKCON Manipur.

Now you are going to Sri Lanka, and then the Hyderbad farm. So I will be interested to hear further developments about the Manipur temple as well as Hyderbad. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
