====== Letter to: Sri S. N. Nayar ======

Sri S. N. Nayar\\
Delhi

Dear Sri Nayar ji,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 21st December, 1975. I have gone through your translation, but it is not acceptable. We have already settled with a Vrindaban gentleman. I am returning herewith your manuscript. Thanking you.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
