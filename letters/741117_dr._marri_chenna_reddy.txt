====== Dr. Marri Chenna Reddy ======

His Excellency Dr. Marri Chenna Reddy\\
Governor of U.P.\\
Raj Bhavan, Lucknow

Your Excellency:

Please accept my greetings and the blessings of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. I am so much thankful to you that you came to see our temple under construction in Vrindaban and supervised the work going on there. As you came all of a sudden, we could not make arrangement for your proper reception, but I am so pleased to learn that you have voluntarily agreed to visit our temple during the opening ceremony.

Tentatively the date is fixed up on Sri Ram Navami, the Birthday of Lord Ramacandra. Probably it will be the fixed up date because we are depending on the progress of the construction work. If you kindly give me your consent, we can print your Excellency's name on the invitation card as the Chief Guest and Inaugurator of the temple.

You are already our member as well as a great devotee of Lord Krishna, so we shall feel it a great privileged if you kindly agree to this proposal.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
Sd. A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
