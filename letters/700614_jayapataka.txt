====== Jayapataka ======

Chicago

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I was expecting Acyutananda's favorable letter at any moment, therefore I was detaining you here. Now the letter is received. You can start immediately for India, and I hope by this time you have received the telegram reading as follows: "Immediately start for India, Acyutananda's letter favorable. Please reply telegram. Gargamuni"

So after going there, work cooperatively with toleration and forbearance. Our philosophy is submissiveness, so I hope in India both you and Acyutananda will work very diligently. There is very good chance for our success in India. We should follow the same principle as I have prescribed here; namely chanting the beads regularly, following the regulative principles, leading the Sankirtana Party on the street, try to sell our literature and books, and work very seriously and sincerely. If you work on this principle the people of India will be charmed by your behavior and they will gratefully acknowledge your transcendental activities.

Are you taking with you a tape recorder? If so let me know and I will send you some tapes. or you may already have got it.

Acyutananda has already taken a nice apartment, so you will have no difficulty. And as soon a I receive good report from you after your arrival, I shall send other ten Brahmacaris.

I am also enclosing herewith a xerox copy of a nice letter received from San Diego. This will help you how to manage affairs in India. You are already experienced and advanced devotee, similarly is Acyutananda, so I count upon you both for great success in India.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
