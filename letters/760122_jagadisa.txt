My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 3rd, 1976 and I have noted the contents carefully. Jayatirtha has also written me about the future of Gurukula. He was suggesting to have a Gurukula in Santa Cruz. I have replied his letter and am enclosing a copy for you. It is my opinion that considering all points, we will do best to move Gurukula to India. In the letter I have explained everything fully.

Another thing, is that you are expecting a BBT loan of $150,000. but the BBT has already taken responsibility for Bombay, Kuruksetra, Mayapur, so this money has to go to India. Therefore, I do not think the BBT can give this loan. Actually it is the responsibility of the parents to maintain Gurukula. By taxing the Temples or taking loan from the BBT the parents are being allowed to avoid their responsibility. Before having a child the parents should see whether they shall be able to pay for their child's education. The GBC should make an injunction that if they beget children, then whatever the expenses are for supporting Gurukula they must pay for it. In another letter to Jayatirtha I have suggested how the parents can earn money for their children's support. So you can discuss everything together and do the needful.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
