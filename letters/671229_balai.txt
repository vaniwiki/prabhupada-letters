====== Balai ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Balai dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of Dec. 26, 1967. In reply I am very happy to hear you are doing so nicely in executing this Krishna Consciousness. Please go on chanting Hare Krishna, and typing, cooking, cleaning or whatever the engagement for Krishna; that way you will always be happy.

To answer you question regarding your names: Balai is the name of Baladeva., Krishna's elder brother. His wife is called Balai dasi, or His girlfriend is called Balai dasi. Baladeva. is not different from Krishna. He is first expansion from Krishna. All the incarnations and expansions begin from Baladeva. Lilasukha is name of Bilvamangala Thakura; this Bilvamangala Thakura was a great devotee of Krishna and he wrote a famous book Krishna Karnamrta, recognized by Lord Caitanya. Kancanbala was one of the gopis in the association of Krishna. Indira was also one of the gopis in the association of Krishna. Ekayani was the wife of a great sage who was in the Satya Yuga when all persons were paramahamsas or liberated persons. Ekayani's husband was a liberated person.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
