Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Mukunda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 16/11/74 from Germany with enclosed documents. Do not sign these documents. Let Bali Mardan explain to me what is the idea.

No, without removing shoes nobody can visit the temple. Where are the arrangements for a ramp? Neither you should make it. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
