My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th August, 1971 and I thank you very much for the same. It is very much encouraging to hear that you have opened one center in Ottawa and soon will start another in London, Ontario. You have got complete capacity to spread this Krishna Consciousness movement. That is a fact. So work enthusiastically and with patience and your attempt will be successful by the grace of Krishna. And continue this door to door program. It is very nice. Lord Nityananda used to do that; Haridasa Thakura used to do that; all of Lord Caitanya's close associates used to do that. So we must follow in their footprints.

Please offer my blessings to the others there.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
