====== Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I may inform you that in Bombay they have received the sanction for constructing the temple in Juhu. Until further order whatever money you collect should be sent to Bombay. You should print books as far as possible, and whatever money you collect should be sent to Bombay.

Gurukrpa has informed by telephone that he is sending you almost $75,000.00. This should be sent to Bombay.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
