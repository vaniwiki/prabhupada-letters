My dear Dasanudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 21st, 1977. Thank you very much for sending the Guru Daksina.

The two essays which you have sent are very nicely written. It appears that you have good talent for writing, so kindly continue to develop in this way and write more and more of your realizations based upon our books. There is no need to concoct anything new. You simply have to study carefully our books and then in your own words try to express what you have read. This will automatically make you a very successful preacher.

There is no need to learn Bengali. I do not encourage learning any new skills. Whatever material abilities one has when he comes to Krsna consciousness, let him learn to engage these in Krsna's service: that is sufficient. There is no need of learning new skills now. That will simply be a waste of time.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
