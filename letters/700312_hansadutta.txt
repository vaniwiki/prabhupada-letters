====== Hansadutta ======

Hamburg

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to Srimati Himavati. I am so glad to learn that both of you have safely reached your destination.

Now work with great enthusiasm and ask Himavati to take care of the Deities very, very nicely. Both of you have seen in L.A. how much they are careful about Deity worship. We have to make our steady progress, keeping both sides in balance; namely the Pancaratriki Biddhi and Bhagavat Biddhi. The Pancaratriki Biddhi is __Arcana__ or Temple worship, and the Bhagavat Biddhi is to preach by chanting and distributing literature. Although chanting is quite sufficient to cover all the Biddhis, still to keep ourselves pure and sanctified, we must observe the rules and regulations of Pancaratriki Biddhi.

Our London Deities are certainly very, very nice; and everyone is captivated by seeing the smiling face of the Lord. It is very enchanting. Now everything is there and you are also experienced, therefore go on opening branches as many as possible and preach Sankirtana movement to your best capacity. Srila Bhaktivinode Thakura entrusted the responsibility to my Guru Maharaja, and He also in His turn empowered us to do the work. Similarly, I am requesting you, all my European and American students, to spread this movement city to city and village to village and make all people of the world happy. Actually they are missing the central point---Krsna, therefore they are unhappy. Let us inform them about this missing point, and certainly they will be happy.

Regarding the $1800, please immediately transfer the money to my checking account No. 3081-61625, Bank of America, Pico-La Cienega Branch (308), 8501 West Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, Cal. 90035. I will have to issue a check for $20,000 by the end of this month, so I want as much money as you can send. There is no question of straining yourself, but try to help us because purchasing that nice church property is a great responsibility---but the property is worth purchasing, as you have all seen it.

Regarding World Sankirtana Party: now the best of my students interested in Sankirtana; namely Mukunda, Tamala, and yourself, are now in Europe, so I hope in the near future you shall organize a very grand World Sankirtana Party and make a tour all the world over. And if you like, I can also go with you.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
