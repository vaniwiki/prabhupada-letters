My dear Mark Phillips,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your letter dated 4th November, 1975. Yes we are eternally related to the Lord as servant, so naturally when we forget our eternal relationship as servants of the supreme master, Krishna, we suffer. A child is naturally subservient to the parent, but if he rebels then the child suffers in so many ways. Therefore Krishna advises everyone in Bhagavad-gita to simply surrender to him, and he will take care of us.

In Australia we have got our temples, consult the Back to Godhead magazine for the temple nearest you. Please visit the temple and take advantage of the pure spiritual atmosphere, this will immediately extinguish the burning fire of material suffering in your heart. Meanwhile I humbly request you to chant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. This chanting will bring you all perfection of life, please try it.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
