====== Ksirodaksayee ======

My Dear Ksirodaksayee,

Please accept my blessings. It is understood that you are not coming in the temple since I left London. Why is this? What you are doing now on behalf of the society? Dr. Bajpai, he gave you a blank check for Vrndavana contribution for 250 pounds, whether you have deposited the check in my account in Lloyds Bank, South Hampton Row Branch.

You may reply me at New Vrindavan address, Rd. #3, Moundsville, West Virginia 26041. Meanwhile, hoping this will meet you in good health, along with your family,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
