====== Govinda ======

Dear Govinda das,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted the devotees recommended by you for first initiation, and their spiritual names are as follows.

Miriam---Mekhala devi dasi

Linda---Lalana devi dasi

Ron---Ranganatha dasa

Ruth---Ruci devi dasi\\
Have their beads chanted on by Jagadisa Prabhu. Our whole Krsna Consciousness rests on following the regulative principles, chanting 16 rounds at least, daily and without fail, and avoiding the four sinful activities. Without following the regulative principles, so called devotional service is simply a disturbance. So be sure to always take care of the devotees in your charge in this respect.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
