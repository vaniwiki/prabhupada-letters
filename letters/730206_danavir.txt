====== Danavir ======

Los Angeles

My dear Danavir das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 14, 1972, and I have noted the contents with care.

It is very nice that you are desiring to assist me in preaching the message of Lord Caitanya all over the world. We need so many preachers to push on this Krsna Consciousness movement and expand our activities. So you continue your engagements and when I come to Los Angeles it will be opportune time for discussion of this matter. For taking sannyasa you may consult your GBC member as we shall be starting a new policy where the sannyasa candidate must meet certain requirements to be determined by the GBC. Karandhara may write to Satsvarupa Maharaja for understanding this matter. This taking of sannyasa should not be a whimsical proposition, and should not be an excuse for becoming irresponsible, no responsibility of grhastha, brahmacari, etc. Sannyasis also have great responsibility to become fearless preachers of our Krsna Consciousness movement. So you consider all these things, and I shall see you and we can discuss further in Los Angeles.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
