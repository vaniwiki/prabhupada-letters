====== Letter to: Gurukrpa ======

Honolulu

My dear Guru krpa,

Please accept my blessings.

This letter is to inform you that I am sending Bali Mardan to Australia to act as GBC for Australia and New Zealand until the Mayapur festival next year. Now you may concentrate on Hawaii and Japan.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
