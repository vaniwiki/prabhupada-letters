====== Hansadutta ======

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of Oct. 5. "Money is the honey" goes so far as it is employed for Krishna consciousness. The body is undoubtedly a material vehicle but when it acts for Krishna Consciousness it becomes spiritualized. By the grace of Krishna material energy can be transformed to spiritual energy & spiritual energy is never deteriorated. To be in Krishna Consciousness means to be in Spiritual energy. More in my next. Hope you are well.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
