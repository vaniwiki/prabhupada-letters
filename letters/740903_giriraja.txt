My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 29, 1974 with enclosures and have noted the contents. Regarding my health, I am improving by the grace of Krsna. Thank you very much for taking so much care of my health by praying to Nrsimhadeva. He is very kind. By all your prayers He will surely take care of me.

It is very good that you are making life members daily locally instead of going to the city. Better to get sympathy in the neighborhood. As soon as they will see our activities, they will be very much pleased. You must keep in touch with them, that is their real complaint. It is a very big scheme. Hundreds of thousands will give for this scheme. Let them come in the evening, see kirtana, take prasada, and liberally contribute. They will feel releaved to contribute to such a good cause. Try to publish in Hindi and Gujarati our literature.

On Hare Krishna Land no proposal for rental of even a pinch of land shall be entertained by you. Strictly this should be followed by you. No more tenants. What tenants we have, if they peacefully vacate, you can give compensation. Do not entertain any proposal for tenancy for any corner of any pinch of land in the Hare Krishna scheme.

It is good that you have gotten the tax exemption number. Send me a copy of the article you will write for the publishing house.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
