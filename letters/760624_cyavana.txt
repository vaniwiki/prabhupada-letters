====== Letter to: Cyavana ======

Evanston, Illinois

My dear Cyavana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 16, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care.

I am glad to see that you are trying to remain engaged in Krishna's service. Concerning your engagement, why not come to New York immediately. I shall be there on July 9, and at that time I shall do the needful so that everything will be alright. You can meet me there at that time.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
