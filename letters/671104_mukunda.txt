====== Mukunda ======

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 22 and I've noted the contents. I am much obliged to you for sending me the record player which is essential but I could save the customs duty of 120 Rs if you could have sent a note stating that it was an unsolicited gift. Anyway the machine was received intact and I am enjoying it. But I have not heard anything definitely whether I shall wait for the final disposal of your visa application or if I may start immediately.

As you say that my absence is being felt now more deeply than ever, so I also feel to start immediately without waiting. The morning prayer can be recorded when I return. If there is actually a brahmacarini asrama organized by San Francisco devotees, it will be very nice to keep there Jadurani as the leader of the brahmacarinis. I am very glad that two other devotees are waiting for me. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
