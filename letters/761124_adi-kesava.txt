====== Ādi-kesava ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Ādi Kesava,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 8, 1976.

I have studied all the letters and clippings in our support. It is very good. This is very important. By Krsna's grace, due to this apparent setback, now this Movement will become more prominent. Sometimes these tactics are also employed in military encounters. Temporarily retreating, then coming forward with stronger force than before. You may consult with Tamala Krsna and Ramesvara and whatever expenditure is required for emergency legal costs may be loaned from the BBT. We must spend for this purpose.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
