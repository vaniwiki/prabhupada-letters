Bombay

My dear Giriraja dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 19th, 1975 and have noted the contents. So far the managing committee is concerned, when I shall return to Bombay, I shall personally form it. In the meantime, go on managing as it is. If there is any possibility of getting money from Africa, then you must go there and collect. That Major Jagdish Sah should be encouraged to continue nicely as he is doing.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
