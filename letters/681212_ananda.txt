Vancouver

My dear Ananda Das,

Please accept my blessings. I have heard from Upendra that you have had some success in arranging for a temple in Vancouver. This is most encouraging news, but why you are silent? Please inform me of your progress there as I am always anxious to hear from you.

You will be very glad to know that our Montreal center has mimeographed a very fine edition in French language of Back To Godhead. I think that in Vancouver there may be good opportunity to circulate this publication so you may write to Hansadutta in Montreal to make arrangements for ordering copies.

I hope that this finds you very well and that you will notify me immediately of what is happening with you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Are you getting BTG from New York? We have now __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ published by MacMillan Company. Copies can be had from New York.
