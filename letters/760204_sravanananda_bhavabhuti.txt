====== Sravanananda, Bhavabhuti ======

Madras

My dear Sravanananda and Bhava Bhuti,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated January 30th, 1976.

In Madras we have to construct a very gorgeous temple. In Nellore the owners of the land are putting so many impossible conditions that we cannot construct. So that foundation stone can be brought to Madras and used for the Madras temple. Now immediately find out some land and begin the construction. Never mind what the cost will be. We are not concerned with the amount of money, but we want a very attractive temple. The money should come from the gentlemen of Madras. The foreign funds are reserved now for Bombay, Kuruksetra, Jagannatha Puri and Mayapur. But if absolutely required, something may be arranged. Go on sending funds to Hyderabad. That construction should be completed as soon as possible. But whatever amount you have sent there, Hyderabad will repay you after their Temple is finished.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
