====== Bali-mardana ======

Calcutta

My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 29th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far the temple in Kuala Lumpur is concerned, we cannot be dictated by others. That is not possible. Yes, the touring program, preaching and distributing our literatures, is more important. Of course for the big cities a nice center is required. So if Kamala Devi is making so many demands there in Kuala Lumpur, then it is not advisable to stay on.

So far Mayapur is concerned, I have not yet received the documents of the purchase of the land from Tamala. They had not yet arrived in N.Y. when I left there, on the 2nd August. So you can send a copy here immediately. Also you should send the temple plan made by Jaju's engineer, so that Naranarayana, presently in London, can be consulted.

Regarding the Book Trust, soon you will be receiving copies of the documents from Karandhara and upon your approval we will draft a final agreement and sign it.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. The Madison Park program has failed on account of the documents not being received. Syamasundara is disappointed.
