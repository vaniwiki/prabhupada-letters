====== Kancanbala ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kancanbala dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I have duly received your letter (undated), and noted the contents very gladly. My sincere blessings are for you for your nice prosecution of Krishna Consciousness. Whatever you are doing at the present moment is approved by me and I think on account of your becoming a sincere soul, Krishna is dictating from within and you are doing things so nicely. There are two gurus---one internal and the other external. The internal Guru is Krishna Himself seated in everyone's heart, and the external Guru is the Spiritual Master. So a sincere devotee is helped both externally and internally. To the sincere devotee the internal Guru Krishna dictates, but the thing has to be conformed by the external Guru then it is all right. I am very glad that you don't go out, and keep indoors engaging yourself in Krishna Consciousness activities.

Regarding love affairs in the material world: they are only shadows or reflections of the real love with Krishna. If you love Krishna in any capacity, you shall never be frustrated because everything in Krishna is perfect, eternal, blissful, and full of knowledge. So continue your present activities and chant your beads; whenever there is some difficulty consult Brahmananda or write to me; and Krishna will help you more and more on the path of perfection. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
