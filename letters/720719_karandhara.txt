====== Karandhara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7/13/72, and I have noted the contents. I have already sent you one telegram "OK SEND KRSNA BOOKS," so by now I think you have duly forwarded the $10,000 as per Bhavananda's instructions. From now on, I am insisting there be at least two signatures.

I do not understand all of the points about purchasing the apartment house, whether I shall be required to sign anything or what. So you may explain in detail what is to be done. As for the payment, we shall not need to cash the bonds, we can manage in other ways to pay the $63,500. I understand that we must pay the full amount cash by August 25, 1972.

As for Dayananda, I am enclosing the letter to him, so you may kindly forward to him. We have celebrated a very, very nice Rathayatra festival here in London, and in the Trafalgar Square itself I initiated nearly 30 new devotees with fire yajna before 25,000 persons, mostly Englishmen. All in all, it was the best Rathayatra we have seen to date. I have not heard anything from you about Rathayatra in San Francisco.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
