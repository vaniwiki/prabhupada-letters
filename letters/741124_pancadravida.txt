====== Pancadravida ======

Bangkok

My dear Pancadravida Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 19, 1974 and am glad to read the contents. Never mind if you do not get the visa for India. We can preach anywhere. We have to preach both in heaven and hell. There is a Bengali saying that a husking machine will husk the rice whether in heaven or in hell. So where-ever Krishna desires we will preach this movement.

Try your best to establish a center in Bangkok, and the men here who have to leave India for visa difficulty, they can go to Bangkok and remain there and get the visas from there. Here now there is visa difficulty, so a center in Bangkok will be good. Manasvi can go to Bangkok to assist you. He speaks Hindi and can be valuable. He has already told Brahmananda that he will go.

So take this as Krishna's desire, and we are servants of Krishna, so our only business is to try to satisfy Him. You are a sannyasi and I have got full confidence in you that you can do very nicely there. Everywhere this movement is accepted, so please keep me informed what is the progress there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
