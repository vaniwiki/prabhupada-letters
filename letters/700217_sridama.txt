My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12 February, 1970, and I am very glad to know that you are doing well in Boston Temple.

I did not know where you were staying and I was very much anxious about your health, so I wrote to Subala and he has conveyed my message to you. Now I am relieved to learn that your are engaged in cooking and your injury is healing nicely. I am also feeling very well here in Los Angeles. Gargamuni has rented a nice house with a sunny compound for me, and I am being attended by two good boys, Nanda Kumar and Devananda.

Hope this letter will meet you again in good health, and thank you for your sincere service.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
