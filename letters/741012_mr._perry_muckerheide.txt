Dear Mr. Muckerheide:

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 12, 1974 and have noted the contents. From your letter I can see that you are an intelligent boy and that you have desire to assist me in spreading this movement of Lord Caitanya all over the world. Due to the influence of the Age of Kali everything is deteriorating, but by taking to this chanting of Hare Krishna mantra our real life of bliss and knowledge is awakened.

But before saving others we must first see that we ourselves are protected from the dangerous effects of maya. Therefore my recommendation to you is that you should associate yourself with my disciples in one of our Krishna Consciousness centers, practice our regulative principles, and study my books very carefully.

You are now living very near to our Los Angeles center, so please take advantage of this and participate fully in the program there. In this way your intelligence will become more and more purified and in consultation with the others there Krishna will give you the proper idea of how to spread Krishna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
