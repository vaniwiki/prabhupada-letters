====== Gunagrahi ======

San Diego

My dear Gunagrahi das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 11, 1975 and have noted the contents. I have accepted upon your recommendation Dan for first initiation. His name is Dvarakaraja dasa. His beads may be chanted upon by Kirtanananda Svami or Satsvarupa Maharaja. I have also accepted Matanga das and Vamsi dasa for 2nd initiation. Their threads and mantra sheet are enclosed herein. Let them hear the tape of myself chanting gayatri mantra (through the right ear). Make sure and train these persons very nicely to follow all of our principles very carefully so that they may not fall victim of Maya.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
