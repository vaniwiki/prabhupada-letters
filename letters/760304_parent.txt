====== Parent ======

My dear parent,

Please accept my blessings. There has been a serious mistake. I do not wish that Gurukula should be closed down in Dallas. So you kindly arrange to send your child back to Gurukula.

One thing is at least for the time being, you must arrange to pay the tuition for your child. If you like, you can get my books and sell them and you can pay tuition in that way. You purchase at the temple's price and sell them and with the profit you can pay your tuition.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
