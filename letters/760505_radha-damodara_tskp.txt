====== Radha-Damodara TSKP ======

New York\\
Radha-Damodara TSKP

My dear disciples,

Please accept my blessings. As it is impractical for anyone to be sent to China at this time, I am sending Tamala Krishna Goswami to resume his old position as manager of Radha-Damodara TSKP. Now all of you work cooperatively. I was very pleased to see how you were working so hard last year to distribute so many books. There is no instance of religious books of philosophy being distributed in such magnitude in history. Now go on enthusiastically and increase this book distribution unlimitedly.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
