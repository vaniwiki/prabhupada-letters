====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

Dear Tejiyas,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8 February 1976 and I have noted the contents. Regarding our sending someone to see Mr. S.M. Patnaik at Bhuvaneśvara, we can do this immediately, however, we may not get a good reception from this man. I would like to have a letter of introduction sent here from Mr. J.B. Patnaik. When we have a positive letter introducing our organization, we can send one man to see Mr. Patnaik in Bhuvaneśvara.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
