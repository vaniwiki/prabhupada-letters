====== Letter to: Joy Fulcher ======

My dear Joy Fulcher,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated December 6, 1968 and have considered the contents.

I know that now there is a shortage of hands in our Seattle center, so why not remain there to help out Upendra and the others. Also your services to attract brahmacarinis will be very valuable in Seattle. I know that you are very nice artist even without the guidance of Jadurani so for the time being you should remain in Seattle and paint independently. You should work to paint very quickly and very beautifully because we have need of such talented artists. When Jadurani first began to paint she was slow but now that she has practiced she has become very expert and quick. So this practice is what will improve all areas of your already very nice art work.

In the future there will be great use for an artist who can take hints from me and paint at least four pictures of 8.5 x 11 size each week. We are planning to begin an illustrated book of all of Krishna's pastimes and stories, so a very good, hard working artist will be required. So if you can practice to do this, it will be great service. With such an artist I can dictate stories for books about not only Krishna, but also Prahlad, Bhismadev, Queen Kunti, and many others from the Bhagavatam. If you can assist me in such a project when we are ready to begin it, then I think that you can come here to take direct instructions. So work hard to develop in this way and we shall see what happens as Krishna plans.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
