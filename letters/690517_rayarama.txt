====== Rayarama ======

My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 14, 1969, and I have received a similar letter from Brahmananda also that you are finding some difficulty in keeping pace regularly with the routine work. My advice to you under the circumstances is that at least for one hour you must all go to have Sankirtana outside on the streets or in the park. That is your life and soul, first business. The next business is completing the chanting of 16 rounds every day. The next business is your editing, and if you find extra time, then you can attend the temple ceremonies. Otherwise you can stop these activities, but outdoor kirtana, your editing work and chanting of 16 rounds must be done. Outdoor kirtana must be done, even at the cost of suspending all editorial work. That is your first and foremost business. Temple worship is not so important. If need be, the whole temple can be locked, but the outdoor kirtana cannot be stopped.

Regarding Birbhadra, Kirtanananda is not here now, he is in North Carolina, but when he returns I shall talk with him about taking our boys to New Vrindaban. Otherwise, they will be returned to their mother in Los Angeles. Regarding the two books you mentioned, they are all right.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. When you come to New Vrindaban, please bring my tape-recorder (in white box) lying in my closet.
