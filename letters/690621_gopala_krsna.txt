====== Gopala Krsna ======

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated June 7, and June 16, 1969, and I have noted the contents. I have also received your presents, shoes and soap, and I thank you very much. I am also glad to learn that the anxiety of your parents is now removed. So go on with your prescribed duty of Krishna Consciousness and be happy. You are a very intelligent boy and faithful to your parents and to your duty. Certainly Krishna will be very much pleased upon you. The father and mother are also as good as the Spiritual Master, and we are indebted to father and mother in so many ways. So as they are dependent on your income, try to help them as far as possible, as well as spend something for Krishna also. Rupa Goswami spent 50% for Krishna, 25% for emergency, and 25% for relatives. You can also try to follow this principle as far as possible. Your main business is to keep in Krishna Consciousness, and if you keep that point in view, you can deal with others according to social conventions without being attached.

Another thing, if you can request your father to supply us with Maharastrian mrdangas and kanjanis, that will be very nice. I wish to import them from Bombay, so if your father or anybody else who may be known to your father can arrange to supply us these things from Bombay, it will be a great service to the society. On receipt of your favorable reply from your father, I can arrange to pay him from a Bombay Bank where I have got money. In the Bank of Baroda, Bombay, I have got some money, and if your father agrees to take this trouble, then I may send him the required money by check, payable in the Bank of Baroda. So you can ask him quotation for the following things: 1) Harmonium---double reed, 2) Harmonium---triple reed, 3) mrdanga, 4) Kanjani. As our new centers are being opened in all parts of Europe, Canada, and America, we require many such instruments. So if your father does some business, he can make some profit also. In Bombay, the Scindia Steam Navigation Co. carries our goods free of charge, so if your father agrees, have him see the director, Sumati Morarji. She will be glad to dispatch our goods free of charge. Or else we can get the goods by paying the regular freight and price. So you can open correspondence either with your father or with some reliable person who can supply the above goods.

Regarding __Back To Godhead,__ I wish that you take charge of organizing the sales in the libraries. If you write letters on behalf of the society, will not that be good? I suggest that you may take a little responsibility for organizing the sales, and wherever you will direct, they will dispatch the sample copies if so required. Or else we can send the copies to you in Montreal for you to do such propaganda work as you like. I am starting for Los Angeles on Monday, the 23rd of June, and I shall be glad to hear from you at our Los Angeles address as follows: ISKCON, 1975 South La Cienega Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90034.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
