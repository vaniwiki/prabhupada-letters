====== Dinesh ======

My dear Dinesh,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12th June, 1970, and noted the contents. I have also received the copy of the letter which you have submitted to the Embassy of India.

Regarding this permission from the Indian Consulate, it must be taken somehow or other. It is very important.

I am very glad to know that you are maintaining a nice program of Sankirtana in the Washington area. Yes, this Sankirtana is our prime means for attracting sincere souls back to Krsna consciousness, so continue to improve your Sankirtana as far as possible. It is very encouraging that you have received written permission from the police to chant and take collections. This permission is very important. Please send a copy of the letter to me for reference.

So it is very good that your sales of literature are very good and improving more. But Gargamuni informs me that the payments for BTGs and book sales are not being sent. So the best thing will be to keep daily count of your stock and how many magazines and books sold, then regularly on Sunday the sales may be totalled for issuing a check to the amount owed to the book fund and to BTG account. Then on each Monday the check may be sent to Los Angeles. So you do this regularly.

Regarding your schedule of temple activities, it is approved by me. So please continue this program of classes, Sankirtana, Deity worship, offering and distribution of Prasadam, and working in Krsna's service. This simple full twenty-four hour schedule will make your life perfect.

So your plan to visit the heads of each of the embassies in Washington to give them some Prasadam and explain our philosophy of Krsna Consciousness Movement is very nice. So do it with great seriousness and Krsna will give you all further intelligence. Regarding the proposal of a new center in Trinidad, that is a nice idea. I know that there is a large Indian community there. For the time being just try to train up this nice older woman who is staying with you. Give her all facilities and instruction for understanding our Krsna consciousness way of life.
