====== Sridama ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings. I was very much shocked to learn that you have again met with some motor accident on the way, and perhaps this is the second time you have broken your leg. So I do not know why such things are happening. Anyway, whatever calamities happen we should take it as Krishna's blessings, as a token punishment for our past misdeeds. That is the observation of a devotee. Whenever he is put into a dangerous position, he takes it as a blessings of Krishna, and the opportunity is used for remembering Him very strongly. So you are now in the hospital, and you have good opportunity for chanting. Do it nicely. I understand you are eating Prasadam from the temple. That is all right. By Krishna's Grace everything will be all right. Don't be worried. Chant Hare Krishna, and when you come out from the hospital let me know. I hope this will meet you, by Krishna's Grace, in improved condition.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
