====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

Boston

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18th, April, 1970, with copies of printing.

__KRSNA, the Reservoir of Pleasure and Other Essays__ is so much attractive I think this book will be sold like hotcakes. I am very much satisfied with this printing work. Although some of the pictures are not on the perfectional stage, on the whole it is done very nicely. I understand that you are going to print further 50,000 copies of this book from another printer. I think this book will be sold by hundreds of thousands. Anyway all the samples that you have sent are all satisfactory.

I have no objection if KRSNA book is made to the 6 1/2 x 9 1/2 size, but a picture book as suggested by the Japanese people looks nice in a little larger size. So I have no objection to any size, which ever size you think will be nice for the market you can do in your choice. The blown up page of NOD looks very nice, so you continue this process in the matter of NOD.

Now as there is some demand for our books, you overflood the market with big and small books as many as possible. Here in this temple last night they sold six copies of TLC. Now the elderly people are coming to purchase our books. I understand also that you are getting good many orders. The sample BTG issue is also very attractive. So manage things to the best of your capacity and Krsna will bless you all and give the proper intelligence also.

The cover picture of the book __KRSNA, the Reservoir of Pleasure and Other Essays__ is so attractive that it bears the meaning of Attractive, Krsna. Thank you very much.

I hope you have received by this time my check for $2409, and I understand from Gargamuni that you are going to send me a counter check for $5000.

This ISKCON Press insignia is very appropriately drawn. It bears the real meaning of mrdanga or press and mrdanga are two parallel lines.

The one Japanese printer has quoted for 10,000 copies of books, at a cost of less than $9,000, so why not print our First Canto Bhagavatam from there? I have asked them if they would give free delivery to our ports at that price, so if they agree, I think the First Canto Bhagavatam may be printed there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. There are some editorial mistakes in the blueprint of The Topmost yoga. I am giving herewith a note Pradyumna. Please send my Bengali small prayer book.\\
