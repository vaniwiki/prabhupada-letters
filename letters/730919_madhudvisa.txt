====== Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your zonal report and proposal for purchasing Australian headquarters. You have my full approval for this program.

I am very much encouraged to note how you have increased the book distribution and are becoming No. 1 distributer in the world. We have published Caitanya Caritamrta so you can order this nice new book from New York.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
