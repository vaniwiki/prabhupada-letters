====== Hari-sauri ======

My dear Hari Sauri,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 20th April, 1977.

I am very much obliged to you for giving such a full report. May Krsna bless you and give you more and more intelligence how to manage everything very nicely in Australia and New Zealand.

As you have recommended them I accept Michael Pepper and Jackie as my duly initiated disciples. Their new spiritual names are;

Michael Pepper---Sikhipiccha-dhari Dasa

Jackie---Venu-dhara Dasi

Now hold a fire sacrifice and the new initiates should vow to always chant minimum 16 rounds daily and faithfully follow the four regulative principles. I also accept for second initiation Jayasila Dasa, Vashrestha Das, Atitaguna Dasi, and Bhadra Dasi. The sacred threads duly chanted on for Jayasila Das and Vasusrestha Das are enclosed herewith, as are the Gayatri mantra sheets for all of them. After the fire sacrifice they may be allowed to hear the Gayatri mantra from the tape in the right ear. Teach them to be good brahmanas, always remaining internally pure by chanting Hare Krsna, and externally by regular bathing.

Yes, the name "New Govardhana" will be very appropriate for your farm. Regarding the idea of getting 36" nim wood Gaura Nitai from Calcutta, that is very good. Or if somebody can carve them locally, that will also be very nice. Regarding the gentleman whom you have met who speaks so many languages, let him translate in any one of these languages any of our books and that will be a great service.

You will be glad to know that I am feeling a little recovered now and every evening I am again able to do my translation work. Now my only disease is that I have no appetite.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
