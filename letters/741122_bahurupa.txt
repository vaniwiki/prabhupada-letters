My dear Bahurupa Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated September 24th, 1974. I am pleased to hear that you are chanting 16 rounds daily and reading my books regularly and following the four rules. In my books the philosophy of Krishna Consciousness is explained fully so if there is anything which you do not understand, then you simply have to read again and again. By reading daily the knowledge will be revealed to you and by this process your spiritual life will develop. Krishna Consciousness is not a hackneyed thing but it is something which is our natural and original consciousness. Presently our consciousness is clouded just like a mirror becomes covered with dust So the cleansing process is this chanting and hearing and doing some service and trying to please the Spiritual Master. By this process our consciousness becomes clear and we are able to understand everything.

So far Gayatri Mantra is concerned, of course it is not such an important thing. The main thing is to chant Hare Krishna but you can consult with the GBC. Jayatirtha and get his recommendation. The Hare Krishna mantra is sufficient for becoming Krishna Conscious. You may please me the most by reading my books and following the instructions therein and by becoming fully Krishna Conscious in this life time.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
