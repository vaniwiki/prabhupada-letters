My dear Ksirodakasayi dasa;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Sept 1, 1974, and thank you very much for it. By the grace of Lord Nrsimhadeva I have recovered from the danger and am improving daily and I thank you for your prayers.

I am very glad to learn that you are reading my books and preaching. That will make you happy, and the audience listening they will also become happy. I am very glad that you are taking up this active service of preaching. In Amsterdam you just try to deliver the fallen souls. Caitanya Mahaprabhu is known as patita pavana, the deliverer of the fallen souls. So as you have taken the vow of service you can deliver the most fallen souls by this Krishna consciousness movement. There in the temple they have got now Jagannatha Deities so let them worship and do it nicely. When you have got practice and 12 brahmana devotees then Radha and Krishna can be installed. Regarding the incense factory; yes, you can guide them but you should not be very much involved with business. Be on the sidelines and help them. Regarding the Hindi printing, no, you do not have to send the manuscript here, you can print there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
