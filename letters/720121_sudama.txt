Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 23, 1971, and I am pleased to hear that everything is going on nicely there in Tokyo center. Japan is now one of the world leaders, so I calculate it as one of our most important fields, therefore I feel some relief to know that you are a very intelligent and capable American boy in charge of such important affairs. You are setting the example of determination which others may see and follow. In this way, go on increasing and such sincerity is noticed by Krishna and He is helping you to approach nearer and nearer to His Lotus Feet.

The tapes which you have sent have been duly received, but I think we shall require many more before leaving India, so if you can provide in the same way as before, please do it. You may send marked clearly "Gift Parcel, No Commercial Value" to Bombay address. Each small packet may be marked "Value less than $2."

So far I know, Bhanu is awaiting some money clearance matters to be completed from the Reserve Bank of India and then he will be departing here very soon.

I am happy to hear that Kartikeya Maharaja has returned to our camp. Now you give him all good counsel and friendship, and if he somehow develops some enthusiasm by becoming artfully engaged, he is very good boy and will be a great preacher. He always has my blessings.

I think that by now Karandhara is there, so he may write me his report, one copy to Bombay address, one copy to Nairobi.

I hope this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
