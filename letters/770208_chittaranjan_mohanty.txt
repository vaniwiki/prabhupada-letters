Dear Mr. Chittaranjan Mohanty,

Please accept my greetings. I have received your undated letter requesting my endorsement of your film, “Shri Krishna Rasaleela.” When I was recently in Bhubaneswara, however, your representative came to see me and I already explained why I could not do so. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu never discussed the topics of Rasaleela in public audience, but only with the most confidential associates. It is not for materialistic persons. I suggested you film the Srimad Bhagavatam, starting with the First Canto, First Chapter. I wish that you develop pure [illegible].

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
