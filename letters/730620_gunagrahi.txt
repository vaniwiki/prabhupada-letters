My dear Gunagrahi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5 June 1973 and I have noted the contents.

Everything appears to be going very nicely there under your management. You are facilitating sankirtana and book distribution by travelling and going to colleges in a trailer, and you are preparing for a large Ratha-yatra festival. This is all pleasing and inspiring to me.

Upon your recommendation I have accepted the following as my disciples: Lawrence Burstein's name is now Lokavarnotamma das, Claude Crocker is now Cittaranjan das, Catherine Crocker is now Citraketu devi dasi and David Sherk shall now be called Gadai das. Regarding second initiation, enclosed is a sacred thread for Lalitananda das and gayatri mantra for he and one for Sita devi dasi. Hold a fire yajna for the first initiates and later, privately you may play the gayatri mantra tape for the new brahmanas. Have them hear the tape in the right ear and show them how to count on their fingers.

Regarding your questions about Gaura Nitai Deity worship: Yes, it is all right Gaura Nitai may wear turbans as well as crowns. You ask what they may wear in the evening---they can wear different dresses or night clothing just as Krsna is dressed. Make a small symbolical bed and give Them rest in that way. Bathe the Deities mentally by mantra and not by pouring upon them.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
