Honolulu

My dear Sudama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 26, 1973. I am much encouraged by your description of your enthusiastic programs there. Others have spoken big words and yet deviated from our basic regulative principles and caused so much havoc. You have now gone there to institute the right thing. I am very much disturbed on hearing so many reports of things going against our principles there in Hawaii but now you have given me the transcendental bliss by your reports of devotees joyfully engaged in Sankirtana and prasadam distribution and reading our books regularly. Continue the routine work and encourage the others. You follow as you are doing and as you have begun things there so others will join you. Those who are not following the regulative principles may say and act whatever crazy thing they may do but we must not compromise with our principles. Those who are actually sincere about spiritual life will gradually see the purity of our movement as you are conducting it and they will become attracted to the real thing. Those who want to be cheated do not take the solution even when it is at hand but prefer to be cheated.

This new service is a great new chance for you in Krsna Consciousness. You are my dear and beloved son and because you are carrying out my instructions there exactly as I have taught you and all my disciples, Krsna will be very pleased with you and all the devotees who are there. It is very good news that there are now 28 devotees and I am sure more will join you in the future.

Yes, I am certainly coming to visit you in Hawaii. I plan to be there by the 14th or 15th of January. Bali Mardan has fixed up arrangements for my staying at a hotel for 4 days. If suitable, I can extend my stay there or make other arrangements once I am there. Always be assured that you are being protected by Krsna and that if you simply carry out my instructions against all odds you will certainly come out successful in the end.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
