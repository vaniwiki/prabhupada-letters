====== Ranadhira ======

Pittsburgh

My dear Ranadhira,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram received by me on 11th February, 1971. Yes, I have all blessings for the happy marriage of Haladhara Prabhu and Joan Prabhu, so you may immediately do the needful in this regards.

How are things going on there in Pittsburgh? I have reports that the temple there is doing very nicely and that our Spiritual Sky incense business is expanding in volume very rapidly. So please keep me informed.

Our preaching work here in India is going on very nicely. Especially we are getting such good response to our life membership program. Have you initiated that program in Pittsburgh? It is a very nice way to distribute our literatures and gain support for our movement, especially from the higher circles. Also book distribution to the schools, libraries, and various institutions is most important. So try and increase on these programs more and more.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
