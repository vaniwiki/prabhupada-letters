My dear Ramesvara das Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received very encouraging reports from the Indian Library Party. Now, there must be sufficient stock of each book in our India warehouse to supply all of these orders immediately. I have written one letter to both Tejyas and Gopala Krishna in this connection, now you should find out their inventory and see that they have sufficient books to meet all of the orders promptly. Perhaps 300 of each book is required for this purpose in stock in India. So they should take inventory in India and order from the Los Angeles warehouse accordingly. Please supply these books promptly upon realization of the actual needs.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
