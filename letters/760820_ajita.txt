====== Letter to: Ajita ======

Cleveland

My dear Ajita das,

Please accept my blessings. As per your letter of request, I am accepting on your recommendation the following for first and second initiation,

__First Initiation__\\
Patricia Taylor---Papsudani dasi\\
Diane Zimmerman---Dinadaya dasi

__Second Initiation__\\
Maharudra das

The names and beads duly chanted upon by your local GBC man, may be given at a fire yajna. The brahmana thread and gayatri mantra which must be heard through the right ear, may also be given at the fire yajna. All initiated disciples must chant 16 rounds a day without fail and observe the four regulative principles very strictly. The brahmanas must become learned in the sastras and very clean internally and externally by regularly bathing with water and the holy name. A brahmana must be fixed up in understanding of brahmana. One should not take it cheaply. This initiation is very serious and one should endeavor to follow the orders of the spiritual master with great determination. Daksina should also be offered when one presents oneself for initiation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
