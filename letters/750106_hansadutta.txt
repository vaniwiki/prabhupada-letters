====== Hansadutta ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Hansadutta das,

Please accept my blessings. I have considered this matter of record distribution and have decided that it should be immediately stopped. It has simply caused havoc. It should be stopped everywhere. The stress must be on books, nothing else needs to be sold. If someone hears a record, he will not understand anything of our philosophy. He will simply enjoy it as sense gratification. But if he gets a book and reads even one page, then he may very likely be induced to take part in our movement. These records are not important. My books are important. You should make arrangement to distribute them in as much quantity as possible.

Enclosed is one letter from Ajita das (president of Stockholm) wherein he expresses anxiety and confusion coming from this record distribution.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
