====== Gurudasa ======

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24th March, 1970. I understand that the Lord Caitanya's Birthday procession was very, very nice and similarly in San Francisco also they took out a procession in the street, and it is understood that 4000 to 5000 people participated. So this is another introduction to our Krsna Consciousness Movement.

Regarding the court case, such kinds of case will come and go. We have to go on with our transcendental business. It is very encouraging that Sankirtana Party is going twice daily, that should be continued. Other things will be adjusted by the grace of Krsna.

I talked with Gargamuni, you can immediately begin the incense business. It is not very difficult and you can do very nice business in London. From Holland you can get very good scents. Holland is a great center of manufacturing essential oils.

One thing, all other centers print the Acarya's name on the letterhead of their stationary---you should also do that. And every center contributes $15 monthly towards my maintenance fund, so you also try to contribute this monthly. Besides that, in your book list I don't find the name of Srimad-Bhagavatam. You should have all the books in stock always. If you have not got any Srimad-Bhagavatams in stock, just order them from Brahmananda. Also, I have not heard anything from Ksirodakasayi in some time. So let me know how he is doing.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
