My dear Hrdayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 30, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I was ready to send some threads and gayatri mantras to Houston, but now you have moved, so I shall send them to Pusta Krishna instead. I am going to Los Angeles soon, you can stay there, and we shall speak some. Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
