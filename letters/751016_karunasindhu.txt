====== Letter to: Karunasindhu ======

Los Angeles

My dear Karunasindhu das,

Please accept my blessings. Concerning your letter of Oct. 5, 1975 addressed to Brahmananda Swami, nobody should interfere with our work. There is no need to send anything to be checked by Purusottama das in Vrindaban. It is useless.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
