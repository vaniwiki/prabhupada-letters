====== Giriraja ======

Bombay

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings.

Sriman Sri Krishna Badruka, son of Hariprasada Badruka, who is staying in our temple there, may stay for one month more. By the end of January he will leave his room. So, there is no cause for agitation.

Regarding going to Wardha, we could not get reservations till now. We shall try again tomorrow. If reservations are not available we shall have to fly to Bombay and then go to Wardha from Bombay, as it will be suitable.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
