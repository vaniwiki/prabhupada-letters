====== Letter to: Ekendra, Shawn, Christina, Dvarakadhisa, Kimi, Tonya, Joe, John, Candramukhi, Carol, Peggy, Lisa, Stephanie ======

My Dear Ekendra, Shawn, Christina,

Dvarakadhisa, Kimi, Tonya, Joe,\\
John, Candramukhi, Carol,\\
Peggy, Lisa, and Stephanie,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very nice Isopanisad papers, with sanskrit, transliteration, translation and purport. You are all very nice devotees. You are very, very fortunate to have the opportunity to be going to this Gurukula. It is the only one of its kind in the world. You are the first students and you must set a good example for the others, always being very enthusiastic to learn from your teachers, offering all respects to your teachers, leading the kirtanas with exuberance. In future you will be the leaders of this Krsna Consciousness Movement, so now you must take this training preparation very seriously.

Hoping this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
