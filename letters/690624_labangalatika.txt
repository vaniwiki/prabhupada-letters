====== Labangalatika ======

My dear Labangalatika,

Please accept my blessings. I am just looking over the letter that you had given to me in New Vrindaban, so I shall reply to it herewith. You are a very good girl, and I have seen with pleasure your advancement in Krishna Consciousness. It appears that in your previous life you had cultured this knowledge, and on account of your pious life, you have got a very good son who is developing in Krishna Consciousness. So New Vrindaban is the right place for you now, simultaneously to advance in Krishna Consciousness and to take care of your boy directly in your presence. I have advised Kirtanananda Maharaja that girls who are living in New Vrindaban should be engaged in the following activities; 1) taking care of the children, 2) cleaning the temple, kitchen, etc. 3) cooking, and 4) churning butter. So for the time being, you remain in New Vrindaban, follow the principles carefully, and I am sure that your life will be successful.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
