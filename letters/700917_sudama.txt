My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your nice letter dated September 14th, 1970, and I have noted the contents. I was very much hopeful about the house, but you have not got it. Don't be worried, Krsna will provide you with a better house very soon.

Regarding the quotation, it appears to be cheaper, but there is no mention of the quantity. So in your next quotation clearly state the quantity.

In India, from the very moment we stepped down from the airplane, there is good propaganda work going on. We are following the same principles as in the U.S.A. by sending Sankirtana Party and it appears to be very successful. We have had many meetings and still we have got many engagements and the functions are going very nicely. The boy Bruce is improving and becoming more interested. He has now sacrificed his hairs for Krsna---that is a good sign.

I hope the methodical way you are conducting our Tokyo Temple will improve more and more and there may not be any more poisonous effects as it happened in the past. Kindly let me know at least once in a fortnight about your nice actions.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
