My dear Lance Nally,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear that you are now becoming serious about engaging in devotional service. Maya is always there like a shadow, presenting reasons for refraining from devotional service but if we simply keep ourselves engaged in Krsna Consciousness, then Maya cannot touch. We become strong in Krsna's service by following the regulative principles and chanting 16 rounds of beads daily. If we do so then everything will be all right. If we neglect chanting 16 rounds then all these irregularities will spring up.

I am glad to note that you would like to see one center opened in Minneapolis. Minneapolis is a large city and certainly a temple should be started there soon. That particular area of the country is under the supervision of Bhagavan dasa Prabhu, Detroit center. If you will correspond with him there in this connection, then I am sure that arrangements can be made for starting one temple in Minneapolis in the very near future.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
