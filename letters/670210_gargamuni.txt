====== Gargamuni ======

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I have already informed you that the Dictaphone is clogging at the last stage from point 25. Is it due to the tape or the machine? Please let me know what to do. Also please pay the rent of Ranchor's apartment since he is here. I hope you are well.
