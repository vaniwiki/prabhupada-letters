====== Dvarakesa, Prabhujaka ======

Frankfurt

My dear Dvarakesa and Prabhujaka,

Please accept my blessings. I have noted your letter of August 23, 1976 addressed to Harikesa Swami and have noted the contents with pleasure. Please continue your program of preaching in Eastern Europe for this program is very pleasing to me. You should be supplied all funds for this program by the local GBC men there in Europe. This program is very important.

People are suffering greatly presently due to having lost all proper vision. They are completely without knowledge as to what is the real purpose of life. They have forgotten what is the real purpose of life. It is up to you to reestablish their lost relationship with Krsna by being sincere to preach the message of Krsna purely by yourself following the instructions of the Lord and his bona-fide representative, the spiritual master. If you follow nicely our Krsna conscious program and preach to these unfortunate people, surely Krsna will recognize your very nice service as He states in __Bhagavad-gita, na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya krttamma,__ whoever preaches this message of __Bhagavad gita__ is considered by Me to be the most dear. So continue on this way, you have my full approval and support.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
