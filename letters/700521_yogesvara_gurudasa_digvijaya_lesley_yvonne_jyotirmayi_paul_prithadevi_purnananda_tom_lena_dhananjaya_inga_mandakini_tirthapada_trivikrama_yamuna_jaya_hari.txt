London

My dear Yogesvara, Gurudasa, Digvijaya, Lesley, Yvonne, Jyotirmayi, Paul, Prithadevi, Purnananda, Tom, Lena, Dhananjaya, Inga, Mandakini, Tirthapada, Trivikrama, Yamuna, and Jaya Hari,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you all very much for your Aksoy Treetiya card. This is the new years day of the appearance of Satya Yuga. Satya Yuga means the age when people did not know anything except the Absolute Truth or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

In Srimad-Bhagavatam we begin our reading by offering of obeisances to the Supreme Truth Satyam Param Dhimahi [[books:sb:1:1:1|(SB 1.1.1)]], so those who are strictly on the Bhagavat line or in Krsna consciousness actually they are living in Satya Yuga age.

Our London Temple is replica of Vaikuntha, so live there peacefully, chant the regular beads, and follow the regulative principles.

I am so much thankful to you for your respective presentations---they are as follows: one golden cup, mysore sandal soap, some scent in snuff box, one picture of London Radha-Krsna Deities and one xeroxed interview report. So I shall be glad to know what is the contents and its formula in the box, then I can use it as snuff.

I beg to thank you once again for these gifts. Hope this will meet you all in very good health in Krsna Consciousness.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Where is Mukunda & Janaki please inform.\\
