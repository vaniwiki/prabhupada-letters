====== Isana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Isana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 14, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the land which you now own, if you are conveniently able to keep it, that is all right. It can be used for developing in the future. But if you need the money for going to London, you can sell it and utilize the money for this purpose. You have described how you meditate on Krishna and your Spiritual Master, but I do not follow what you mean by "identify". To think of Krishna and your Spiritual master is very nice, but if you think you are Krishna or Spiritual Master, that is Mayavadi philosophy. One should not indulge in this sort of thing. I have already received the constitution notes from Janardana, and I am very encouraged by his descriptions of the opportunities of spreading Sankirtana in Paris.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please inform Gopala Krishna that I have received his presents with thanks. ACB
