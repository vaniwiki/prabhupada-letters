====== Nalinikanta ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Nalini Kanta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 12th, 1977. Thank you very much for the donation of 50 dollars.

Unless the books are written by a PhD we do not want it. We are not going to be able to print the books you have suggested. There is no need for such books. Instead of writing simply read my books. That will be better for you. Whatever free time you have engage in reading my books. Otherwise, an idle mind is a devil's workshop.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
