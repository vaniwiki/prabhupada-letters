====== Letter to: Sri Govinda ======

Evanston, Illinois

My dear Sri Govinda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 7, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

I know that you are a very intelligent devotee and that you are very capable. Why not contact Tamala Krsna Goswami in New York and see if you can work together with him to distribute our literature all over the world. He is now formulating plans how to increase our distribution everywhere, and perhaps you can be instrumental.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
