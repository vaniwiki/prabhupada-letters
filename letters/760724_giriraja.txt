<card class="letter">
My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated July 17 and have noted the contents with care.

This news of the donation of Mr. Malhotra is very good. Take the land and utilize it. Many good guests will come to such a place and I will also come. Estimate the cost and we shall do it immediately. I will come and see the land upon arriving in Bombay.

You may print in Marathi the Bhagavat Darsana and Lokanatha Swami may edit the translations done by others. We have government paper so you may print with this. I think though, that there is more than one Maharastrian devotee, but anyway there are many sympathisers who would be willing to voluntarily serve by this translation work.

This idea of Mr. Binbani's is very good; you should encourage him. You may say that the entire expense of this issue has been met by the Binani Trust. This will encourage the other trusts to also contribute. It is very nice that he wants to help the printing of literatures. The construction of the temple is going on, now let us have new publications. I am sending by separate registered post the Hindi translation of the Nectar of Devotion. You should print it. Our Bombay center is a general cultural institution for the education of scientific knowledge and spiritual life. I am trying to induce responsible men to fully retire from family life and take to Krsna consciousness.

Ashok's mother is a good lady as are all of them. Please give my blessings to her.

Regarding this research tax exemption, we have got so many Phd's also, and are starting the Bhaktivedanta Institute for making research work for the improvement of the economic condition of the world. We are introducing many farms and they are very successful. We want to introduce this in India also.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
