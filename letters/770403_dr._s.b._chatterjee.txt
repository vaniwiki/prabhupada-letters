Dear Shri Chatterjee:

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 30, 1977.

Study of Vedanta is not a question of hobby. It is a question of realization. Shri Swarup Damodar was the secretary of Caitanya Mahaprabhu and many scholars of that day used to come and see Caitanya Mahaprabhu with their writings. One brahmana also came. This is mentioned in the Caitanya-caritamrta. Shri Swarup Damodar advised that brahmana that your Bhagavata study was imperfect. So the best thing would be that we have a Board of learned scholars for higher studies, the Bhaktivedanta Institute. I wish that you completely join this movement along with the other learned scholars and become a Bhagavata. Then everything that you speak and write will be perfect.

You say that in the near future you wish to join one of our temples. Why the near future? Do it immediately! First live in our temple and practice our way of life. Then all facilities will be available to you. We have big centres in Vrindavan, Mayapur, and Bombay, so you may live where you like.

But one thing you must understand, there is no question of keeping any profit. All profit goes to Krishna.

I hope this meets you well.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
