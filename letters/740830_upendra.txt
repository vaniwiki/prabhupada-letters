====== Letter to: Upendra ======

Laguna Beach

My dear Upendra das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 16, 1974 and have noted the contents. So you have returned, but now you must be very careful not to become rubbish. If you are keeping long hairs, they must be removed. All of my disciples must be clean shaved. Even anyone who stays with us must be clean shaved. They can visit, but anyone who wants to remain with us must be clean shaved.

So for a time you may come here to India. Yes, I know your wife, she is of nice character and chaste girl.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
