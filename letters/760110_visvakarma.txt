====== Letter to: Visvakarma ======

Toronto

My dear Viswakarma,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your undated letter.

Yes, it is the mercy of Krishna that we have got such an important building in Toronto. It is a top-most triumph. If you can fix up a neon sign always moving with the maha-mantra Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, that will be a great achievement. The sign can be on from evening to mid-night, that will be the proper utilization of such an ideal building and location. Christianity is now declining, therefore they are having to sell all their churches to us. Because they have got no clear idea of God, people are not satisfied with them. But we can explain what God is, so people are appreciating more and more our Movement. Now by Krishna's grace you have a beautiful Temple, use it to preach very vigorously. If you all strictly follow the principles and chant sixteen rounds, your spiritual strength will be insured, and our Movement will become increasingly prominent.

I accept the recommended devotees as my initiated disciples. Their spiritual names are:

Errol Lewis---Ugresa dasa

Craig Harper---Asuramarjara dasa

Subash Batra---SubhaVilasa dasa

Asha Batra---Ashalata dasi\\
Now you have to hold a fire ceremony. Instruct everyone to faithfully chant 16 rounds and follow the regulative principles. Teach them by your personal example.

Regarding Bon Maharaja, in the future he should be completely avoided. We shall have no further connection with him.

Enclosed is a letter to SubhaVilasa which you may please deliver to him.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
