My dear Lokanatha Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 13 August 1976 and have noticed the contents with care. I am very very pleased to learn that you are preaching so nicely. May Krsna bless you and give you more and more abilities. I shall let you know my program when I reach Delhi. I shall be in Delhi on the evening of the 25th of this month. Then after a week I shall go to Vrndavana. I shall chalk out my program at this time.

Either I go with you or not, the program which you are doing is completely approved by me. Go on steadily with your program. As long as we are following the regulative principles of devotional service I am always with you. So be encouraged to continue this program more and more and expand it so that the preaching may be heard in every town and village. I am very pleased by your report with the enclosed news clippings. Thank you very much.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

nb.---the initiations may be done when I reach Vrndavana.\\
