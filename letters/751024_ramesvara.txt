Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 11, 1975 and I have noted the contents with care. Concerning the print of the painting "showing Bhagavad-gita being worshiped," I do __not__ consider this suitable for using in our books.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
