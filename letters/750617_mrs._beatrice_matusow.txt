My dear Mrs. Matusow,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 2, and have noted the contents. Regarding your idea, I think it will be best, if the next time you come to Honolulu, you come to our center here and discuss this proposal to the temple president named Manasvi dasa. Then some decision can be made.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
