====== Krsna dasa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Krishna das,

Please accept my blessings. Yesterday I received a packet from you containing several letters from different parts, and I thank you very much for it. I am expecting one air mail small parcel from India, from Indo Crafter. If it does come, you can immediately redirect it to me by simply writing the new address on the package and putting it in the mailbox. That will not cost you anything. But I have not received any letter from you since I left Hamburg. You will be glad that here the reception was very nice, and I am enclosing herewith one press cutting, although there were several other nice cuttings also of our activities and picture. We have already passed through two important programs here: one big meeting at the Town Hall, attended by Indians and Englishmen, which was very successful, and one nice meeting when the BBC men invited us for television on Tuesday night. They came also to the temple last night, and it was very nice. We are expecting many engagements from different persons, and it appears that people are interested in the Krishna Consciousness Movement. So I shall be glad to know how your center is making progress.

The immediate problem is to secure a nice place, and if it is possible to do so during my stay in Europe, then I shall go there again to Hamburg to install the Deity. From India I have settled up with a firm to supply Deities along with other things. So I have ordered four pairs of Radha-Krishna Deities, 24" high, weighing about 30 lbs. each. The cost will be about $100 per pair, or 400 marks. The firm in Germany wanted $650 for the Deities, 12" high, so there is much difference of price. Therefore I have decided to get them from India. I have already ordered four pairs: two pairs for England, one pair for France, and one pair for Germany. So I hope very soon you shall find out a nice place, and we shall install the Deities as early as possible. I am enclosing herewith one newspaper cutting published in New York, and you will find how Patita Uddharana, Rsikumara and other boys are chanting and getting alms. Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
