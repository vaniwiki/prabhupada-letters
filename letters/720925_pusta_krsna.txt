====== Pusta Krsna ======

London

My dear Pusta Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your note from Boston dated September 22, 1972, and I think that by now you must be in London. I am very glad to hear that you will be holding Bhagavata-dharma Festivals all over England. I know that you are good preacher and sincere boy, and Revatinandana Maharaja is also sannyasi, so you work together with him and with the others in cooperative spirit to spread this Krsna Consciousness movement widely all over the British Isles. From Revatinandana I can understand that there is immense field for preaching amongst the youth and in all parts of the country, so do not hesitate to take the bold step forward and invite everyone to become devotee of Krsna.

One thing is, now we have got many many books in England and we must raise funds for our place there, so try to increase the selling of literatures and magazines and deposit everything in the building fund. Preach, sell books, in this way gradually you will feel yourself becoming perfectly happy.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
