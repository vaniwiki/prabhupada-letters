====== Trivikrama ======

My dear Trivikrama,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of August 3rd, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased to learn of the nice service you are rendering in London, and all of your godbrothers and sisters who have written to me from there have praised your nice endeavors. I have already told Yamuna to put the Deities away for the time being, so this will solve your question. When I arrive in London we shall consult together how to best spread Sankirtana Movement throughout England. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
