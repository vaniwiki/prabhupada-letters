My Dear Naranarayan, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2nd January and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear how in Pittsburg you are engaged in distributing our books and also helping Ranadhir with incense distribution. Our book distribution program is so much important and you should continue vigorously in this direction. Especially if you can get our books into the schools and libraries, that will be very nice. Such book distribution is first class preaching work.

For book distribution our life membership program has been very successful here in India and we want to initiate this program whole-heartedly in all our centers. So you should certainly try to make life members also. In this regards if you have any questions you can discuss with Rupanuga or any of the GBC members and he can give you all pertinent information.

Also in this respect, your wife would be a great help to you and you could work as a team in making life members. Treat your wife nicely instead of fighting and creating misunderstanding. Train her up for such useful purpose and it will be a great help to both you and the society. She is very intelligent girl and I am always remembering her article. Ask her to write me also.

That you want to open one center in Buenos Aires, Argentina in South America is certainly approved by me. So under the supervision of the GBC you may make such plans. I am anxious to see that we establish some nice centers in South America also.

Please offer my blessings to the others there in Pittsburg. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
