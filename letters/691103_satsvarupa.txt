====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter dated November 18, 1969 and have noted all the points carefully. I can understand that the composing program is not going as planned. Therefore, I think Palika Dasi may immediately be trained to help with this task. For layout work I have already asked Aravinda to come to Boston to do that work. So these two devotees will be posted in Boston for the time being to centralize the activities. Then we shall see how to pick up further men. For editing the Sanskrit words you can send me a list of the words, and I shall send you the correct diacritic marks. You write that you shall send me your changes for the __Krsna__ manuscript pages here with me, and upon receipt of them I shall do the needful. Please also send carbon copies of the tapes you have edited in the past few months. By separate post a new tape is being sent to you.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
