====== Letter to: Vamanadeva ======

St. Louis

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 19th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. The beads enclosed have been chanted and are enclosed herewith along with one letter for Sravaniya Devi Dasi.

If you leave, who will look after St. Louis? You are a householder with wife and children. You can't move very often. Better you stick to one place and develop it nicely. Whenever you move you have to take so much trouble to move your whole family. I do not know what is the situation there in St. Louis but in every center there is potential to improve more and more. My opinion is that you stick to St. Louis and develop it more opulently. Of course I am in favor of opening new centers but not at the cost of taking from our already established centers.

So you are an advanced student. Krishna is giving you intelligence. So use your discretion. But your wife is pregnant, so it is best not to move at the present. Just like this girl Sravaniya Dasi, so many neophytes are coming. So guide them all and help them to become Krishna Conscious devotees. That is the greatest service to humanity. Krishna is very much pleased upon such devotees who try like this.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
