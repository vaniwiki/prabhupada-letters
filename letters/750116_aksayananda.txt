Madras

My dear Aksayananda Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 11-1-75 and have noted the contents. Stridish das was just here and he has brought you the answers to your questions I hope. Your program sounds very nice there.

You have mentioned the idea of having a pandal in Madras between the Mayapur and Vrndavana festivals. This will be nice, if it is practical. If you can arrange it co-operatively with the other leaders, then I shall also come there at that time. So, you can consult amongst yourselves and see if it will be possible or not.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
