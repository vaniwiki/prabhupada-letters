====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

Montreal

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 31st December, 1970. Also I very much appreciate the new edition of French Back To Godhead enclosed, printed by our ISKCON Press. Overall the magazine was very nicely produced and I am pleased.

Some improvements in the format of the magazine can be made though. For our English edition I have instructed Satsvarupa that there should only be one article by myself no more than four pages in length and that the remainder of the magazine should be made up of articles by our students. Also, so far as the order of presentation, first my Guru Maharaja or senior acaryas, then myself, then our sannyasis, and then other students. In this way you can present our French BTG and that will be very nice.

I am very glad to learn that you are trying to distribute our books. Please continue with this program as it is so very important. Especially try to place our books in the schools and libraries. Our literatures are for the intelligent class also.

I have also received from you one very interesting article interviewing one Dr. Wilfred G. Bigelow, a heart surgeon at Toronto General Hospital. I have commented on his points in one letter, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. Perhaps you could encourage the doctor by presenting our literatures to him and inviting him to our temple there.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. When I was at Bombay Airport, your mother, father and sister came to see me. They talked with me for a long time. Your mother is anxious to see you with your wife.\\
