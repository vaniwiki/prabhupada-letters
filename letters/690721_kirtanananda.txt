====== Kirtanananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 16, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am so pleased to learn that everything is going very nicely in new Vrindaban now, and the men, women and children devotees are all happily executing their daily functions. I have received the cheese you have sent, and although it was nice, there are yet some improvements to be made. The improvements are that first you should put the cheese in a frying pan and stir vigorously, adding 1/4 of sugar. While on the fire it should be stirred and mixed as nicely as possible. Then while it is cooling it should still be stirred as nicely as possible. Then when it is cooled you should knead it to make dough. When it is soft enough you can shape it into squares or round shapes as you like. The cheese you have already sent was not bad, but this procedure will improve upon it further.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
