My dear Jayapataka Swami:

Please accept my blessings. In Hawaii they are arranging for manufacturing plastic kholes. You can arrange one or two Bengali experts in making and fitting the heads of the kholes. They must be prepared to stay with us for at least one year. We will pay their transportation to Hawaii and return and also a small salary. Our men can then learn from them. We now require so many khols for expanding our Sankirtana movement.

I have not received any report from you. I am anxious to know how you have spent the money.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
