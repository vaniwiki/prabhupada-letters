Dear Bhakti das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received from you the name of one devotee recommended for second initiation, Santipani devi dasi. So I am enclosing one gayatri mantra. Have her hear the mantra through the right ear, of me chanting gayatri. I have already cautioned you that the second initiation should be given out only when you are certain that the devotee is really following all our principles, so now instruct her further on the seriousness of following the regulative principles of Krsna Consciousness. All the devotees there are in your charge so by your example they will best be encouraged to enthusiastic advancement.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
