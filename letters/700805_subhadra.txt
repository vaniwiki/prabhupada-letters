====== Subhadra ======

My dear Subhadra dasi,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your nice letter dated July 22, 1970 Thursday night. I did not reply right away because I am getting ready to to lead a Sankirtana Party to chant Hare Krsna in Japan and then to India, where Lord Sri Krsna had all His Pastimes with the cowherd boys and girls. Yes, you are certainly right when you say Radharani cooks prasadam for Lord Krsna. Whenever He returns in the evening from herding cows with His cowherd boy friends, Radharani has a nice preparation waiting for Lord Krsna. You have also mentioned about Krsna playing on His flute. In the __Nectar of Devotion,__ it is said that Lord Krsna attracts living entities from all over the universes by simply playing on His flute.

Now please listen faithfully to your mother and father and they will teach you all about Lord Krsna. It is said that everyone has a mother and father but only a few are fortunate enough to have a Spiritual Master. So you are doubly fortunate, you have a Spiritual Master and also you have a nice Krsna consciousness father and mother, simply live by their example.

I am hoping this reply finds you in happy mood, and I remain

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
