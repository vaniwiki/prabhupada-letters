====== Hariprasada Badruka ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Sriman Hariprasada Badruka:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 27th February. I just arrived here the day before yesterday and I am glad to receive your Hyderabad progress report. The Deities mentioned are too expensive. Of course, we cannot collect money without Deity worship. Without Deity worship there is no life, and there must be preaching also.

But the thing is, without Indian devotees rural preaching cannot be effective. They are mostly illiterate, how they will understand? We must avoid the risk of a separatist movement, __unity__ is our purpose; just like in London where the Indians are starting their own Hindu Radha-Krsna Temple. We want to avoid skin disease and the Indian people are like the tannery expert. Such a cobbler is expert at skin disease. They will see our Sankirtana Party and think it is a white dance. Anyway, how to gather Indian devotees, that program is wanting.

I shall be going to Mayapur by the 15th, remaining there up to the 22nd. I hope to see you soon and I hope this meets you and your family members in good health. Hare Krsna.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
