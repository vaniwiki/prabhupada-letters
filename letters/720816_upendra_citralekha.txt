====== Upendra, Citralekha ======

Sydney

My dear Upendra and Citralekha,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 6 August, 1972 along with the balaclava hat. The hat is very nice and it is now cold in London it also had some immediate use. But now I am in Los Angeles and the weather here is very warm so I have kept the hat in London for my use whenever I shall go there.

I am very happy to hear that both of you are becoming happy in your Krishna Consciousness spiritual life, and that in general everything is going on very nicely there in Australia.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
