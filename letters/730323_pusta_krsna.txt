====== Pusta Krsna ======

My dear Pusta Krsna:

Please accept my blessings and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 13th of March, with enclosures.

Yes, your study program is nice. By writing according to our realization we become more and more convinced and all doubts are destroyed. I have looked over your essay and I think you are understanding our philosophy rightly. Why don't you write something for Back to Godhead?

We can avoid idle conversation and utilize our time in the spare moments for studying slokas from the Gita and Bhagavatam. Practically I have given you more than enough for 50 years at one sloka daily. If we can simply read one sloka daily, that is step by step progress.

I said it long ago, that we are trying to make Brahmanas from anywhere in the world. We can offer the intelligent person the opportunity to be trained up in the highest spiritual knowledge and train him up as a preacher himself. That is a very attractive offer, so in your traveling SKP you can preach like that, and quote some important slokas from our books and wherever you go you will be respected and you can recruit some solid devotees for pushing on this movement. So kindly go on with your program.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
