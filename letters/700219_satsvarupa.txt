My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13 February, 1970.

Please do not be disturbed by second-hand information. Just continue your editing as you have been doing nicely.

I hope you have been receiving the transcriptions and edited versions of Krsna tapes which I have sent to Bhagavan das. I have not received any copies from him, still I have continued to send him tapes, and I have sent some to you also.

I am now delivering some lectures every Sunday at the L.A. Temple and the series may be called "Sinful Activities and Their Resultant Reactions." They will be transcribed here weekly, and sent to you for editing.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
