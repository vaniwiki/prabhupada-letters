====== Letter to: Hari-sauri ======

My dear Hari Sauri,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram. It is not possible to reply you by telegram because there is necessity of sending beads, and sacred thread which can only be sent through a regular letter.

As you have recommended him, I accept Clayton as my duly initiated disciple. His spiritual name is Karsna-Dasa. You should hold a fire sacrifice and he must vow to chant minimum 16 rounds daily and follow the four regulative principles faithfully. His beads already chanted on are being sent by separate post, so the fire ceremony should be held after receipt of the beads. I also accept Anupam Das and Bimala Dasi for second initiation. Anupam's sacred thread duly chanted on is enclosed herewith. After the fire ceremony they may be allowed to hear the Gayatri mantra in the right ear. They should be instructed to always remain clean, internally by chanting Hare Krsna and externally by regularly bathing.

For ten days I was staying in Risikesh in a very nice house on the side of the Ganges River. But my health was not good and so I have come to Vrndavana where I will stay indefinitely.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
