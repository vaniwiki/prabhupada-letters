====== Letter to: Taitreya ======

Hawaii

My dear Taitreya,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter and check for $1,000 and I thank you very much for this contribution. So, fortunately you have got a very good husband, and you are also a very good wife. So, live co-operatively and help him in writing essays which he has done very nicely. In this way, both of you will be happy and successful in life.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
