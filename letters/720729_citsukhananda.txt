====== Letter to: Citsukhananda ======

Mexico City

My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Mexico City dated July 17, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I am also eager to come there but immediately I am in Europe. But I promise I will go again, and I will let you know when I can come. I also want that you take that place at Puerto Vallarta from our Daniel. I like that place very much.

Everywhere wherever Krishna Katha is spoken, that is Vaikuntha. And wherever I go to my branches, you my good devotees turn it into Vaikuntha and I wish to be there where my disciples are.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
