Houston

My dear Prahladananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14th May, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so glad to note how ISKCON Houston is making steady progress for becoming a grand success. And Sankirtana is being well received, especially at the schools and university. That is very nice. Try especially to distribute our literatures there and lecture also. These books are so much potent that anyone who reads them is sure to become Krishna Conscious. They are so nice. So we want to make propaganda in that way. And if you are enthusiastic and sincere in your efforts, then Krishna will give you all facility.

So far as your questions: parching the body unnecessarily is not the desire of the Supreme Lord. So one who goes against the rules and regulations of scriptures is causing pain to the supersoul. Therefore, parching the body means parching the supersoul.; generally it is the process to simply chant and hear, but if Krishna's lila comes into remembrance, that is very good. It should come automatically. Not that you are remembering artificially.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
