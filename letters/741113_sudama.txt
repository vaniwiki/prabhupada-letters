====== Sudama ======

Hawaii

My dear Sudama das Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 21, 1974 and have noted the contents. So we have already discussed about the new house, and I shall be looking forward to coming there sometime in mid December. So please arrange.

In the meantime you go on managing things there very nicely, and you can refer matters to me. In this way Hawaii will be managed. Regarding your request for being GBC of Hawaii, yes formally you were GBC of Japan, so it can be considered at the next GBC meeting during Gaura Purnima time.

Krsna has given you a very good field there, and I know there is wide scope for spreading our movement, and I like the place there. So do everything very carefully, always following our principles, and Krsna will give the necessary intelligence for pushing on this sublime movement very successfully.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
