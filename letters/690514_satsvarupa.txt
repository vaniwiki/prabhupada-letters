====== Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 12, 1969, delivered by Arundhati here in Columbus. This evening Arundhati will be married to Pradyumna, and they appear to be a very nice couple. Regarding your questions about Sankirtana Party, I think you should try to always have Sankirtana going on. All other things are subsidiary. This chanting is our life and soul, so we must arrange our program now so that there will be as much chanting on the streets and at college engagements as possible. On May 12th, we had a very successful engagement at Ohio State University, and over one thousand boys and girls were chanting and dancing along with us. So this policy should be continued as far as possible.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. What about the Omega watch? I have sent you one tape. Have you received any check for the meetings? You paid me two checks (75 & 25) but if there is any more please send. I want to purchase one compositor ($3000.00 Down payment $600.00) ACB
