====== Letter to: Cidananda ======

San Francisco

My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated Feb. 20, and I have noted the contents. You can arrange to supply prasadam only to our devotees. We are not in a position financially to distribute foodstuff for the poor class of men. Such men may take shelter of some charitable institution. At the present moment, we are not in a position to make charities but for the devotees we can sacrifice anything. So you can stop preparing prasadam for persons who are not willing to work neither to pay. Regarding your going to India, that is already in my program. Please save some money, not only for your passage but also for my passage. I am coming back to San Francisco by the 10th of March. When we meet we shall talk more of our Indian program. I think it is Krishna's desire that you should come to India with me and help in establishing a nice Indian center there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
