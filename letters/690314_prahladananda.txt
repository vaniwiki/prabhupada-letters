====== Prahladananda ======

My dear Prahladananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March the 5th, along with your check for $30.00 for my book fund. I thank you very much for your this contribution of love. I am just trying to disseminate this message of my Spiritual Master and if there's any credit for this service, everything goes to Him. This message of Krishna Consciousness is coming down from Krishna Himself, and we are all servants of the Supreme Lord working under the consecutive disciplic succession. Please try to understand our philosophy through various books that I have already published and sometimes after you will have to carry out this order of disciplic succession. I am very glad to inform you that I am keeping well here in the atmosphere at Hawaii. The atmosphere here at Hawaii is quite suitable for my health. I am staying on the sea beach side, and the place is also very congenial.

I hope this meets you in good health, and happily executing Krishna Consciousness.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
