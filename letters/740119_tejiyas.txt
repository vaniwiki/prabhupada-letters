====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram reading as follows: "Vrindaban Temple Construction Fund current account open no. 230. Karandhara informed."

I suppose the current account is open in the Punjab National Bank, Moti Bagh branch as I informed you previously, although you have not mentioned the name of the bank. I am advising the Vrindaban branch of the Punjab National Bank to transfer immediately Rupees one lac, (Rupees 100,000), to the Punjab National Bank, Moti Bagh branch, New Delhi, in favor of the Vrindaban Temple Construction Fund, account number 230. Please take care of this information and I am reaching New Delhi on February 3rd, by Pan American airlines, flight number 1, arriving at 4:30 A.M. Please do the needful and more when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Henceforward all collections for Vrindaban Temple Construction should be deposited in this newly opened fund account, number 230, Punjab National Bank, Moti Bagh, New Delhi
