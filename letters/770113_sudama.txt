<card class="letter">
New York

My dear Sudama Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated Jan. 3rd and have noted the contents. It is nice that you are enthusiastically engaged in New York. I have no objection to your worshiping my murti for Guru Puja. But for placing in the temple there must be a pair of murtis, (my Guru Maharaja must be there) as in Krsna-Balarama Mandir, and they must be permanently installed. This may be done in accord with the temple authorities. Or else you may worship one murti of myself privately in your room.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
