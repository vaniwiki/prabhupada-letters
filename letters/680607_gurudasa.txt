My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated June 2, 1968. Gargamuni's remark that your book "SWAMIJI" may be interesting only to the admirers and disciples is right. . . so if you are preparing some book like that, make it so nicely that it may be accepted by general public. And for this purpose, it is better to add with the pictures my speeches, which are of public interest. There are so many tape records of my speeches, you can select some of them to be printed with the pictures. I think that will be better attracting the general public. It is better you take a little more time but do it very nicely.

Our London program is gradually becoming a tangible fact. And I am receiving letters from California devotees which are very encouraging. I think I shall be starting for London in the month of August. Certainly, your conclusion is very nice; we should always depend on Krishna. But for service, we can make our plan, and Krishna will help us.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
