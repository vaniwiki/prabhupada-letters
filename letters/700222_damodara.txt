====== Letter to: Damodara ======

Washington, D.C.

My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15 February, 1970, along with a check $15.00 for my maintenance account. Thank you very much for it.

I am very pleased to learn how things are going on very well in Washington center and that you are nicely celebrating the various Advent days of our great Acaryas. But I am especially glad to know of your very successful work amongst the students. This is very encouraging to me. I know that the young people of your country are all eager to take up this Krsna Consciousness movement, simply we must sincerely present our program to them in such a nice way by chanting Hare Krsna, dancing, speaking something about our philosophy, advertising and selling our literatures, and distributing Prasadam.

In this connection, I may inform you that in order to maintain our status of spiritual strength, everyone of us must very rigidly chant daily sixteen rounds without fail and follow the regulative principles strictly. This is essential for understanding our philosophy clearly and for being able to impress Krsna Consciousness in the hearts of others; so our sincerity in this respect is most important, and all such duties should be observed regularly by everyone. I hope that you will see that all the boys and girls there are following this process, and studying our literatures carefully.

Hope this will meet you in good health, and please convey my blessings to all the devotees of Washington center.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
