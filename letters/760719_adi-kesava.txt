====== Letter to: Ādi-kesava ======

Iskcon, New York

My dear Ādi Kesava Maharaj,

Please accept my blessings. I wish to thank you for assisting in organizing such a grand Rathayatra on 5th. Avenue in New York. I am very much pleased with your sincere efforts. Go on like this and Krishna will surely bless you.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
