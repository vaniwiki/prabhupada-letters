====== Letter to: Amogha ======

Jakarta

My dear Amogha das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 18, 1973, and I have noted the contents with great interest. It is so nice you are arranging our preaching program there in Indonesia. So I have left it to Madhudvisa Swami to arrange the dates of the program there. But one thing is, you should not arrange more than one program per day, and that program should either be in the morning or after 5:00 at night. I want to finish this traveling very shortly and settle down to translate my books. So I am counting on you boys and girls to push on this movement and preach vigorously all over the world, and we shall be successful.

As far as the dates of the programs, that you must arrange with Madhudvisa Swami as we shall be coming to Indonesia via Australia and New Zealand and then shall be returning to Calcutta by March 1 for beginning preparations for our Mayapur function. So I shall be looking forward very much to seeing you shortly, and at that time we may discuss things at further length.

Hoping this finds you well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
