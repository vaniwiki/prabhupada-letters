====== Nara-narayana, Dinadayadri ======

New Vrindaban

My dear Nara Narayana and Dinadayadri,

Please accept my blessings, I am in due receipt of your letters dated 1st November and 26th October respectively and have noted the contents carefully.

That you are working hard to build cottages there in New Vrindaban is very encouraging to me. I want very much to see this project grow, so you please continue to work in this respect. So far as what materials to be used to finish the cottages, I think whatever is easiest and least expensive is best.

So far as your casting of Murtis there during the winter months, that sounds very nice. If you could produce plaster Murtis of Lord Caitanya the same size in height as Kartamashai Murtis you produced earlier, that would be very nice. And then your good wife Dinadayadri, acting as pujari there, can take nice care of that Murti. Husband and wife working conjointly in Krishna Consciousness is the perfection of household life. So both of you go on working in this way to strengthen and improve our wonderful New Vrindaban community project and Krishna will be very pleased.

Hoping you are both in good health and happy in the service of Lord Krishna. Kindly offer my blessings to the others there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
