Sripad Narayana Maharaja,\\
Accept my dandavats. I last wrote to you on the 28th of September, and I also sent you a check for Rs 1500/-. I still haven't received any letter from you, and I am worried. Please make me happy by writing me a letter as soon as you finish reading this one. Please let me know if all the goods have been purchased. If you don't think that the money I sent is enough, don't buy the tambura for Rs 200/-. But the other goods should be packed properly, and you must send them to Calcutta. Along with the railway receipts send it by registered post to the following address:

M/S United Shipping Corporation\\
14/2 Old China Bazaar St.\\
Calcutta - 1

Send it to them with the train receipt, and forward it by registered post with acknowledgement. They will ship it and deliver it to the USA. Have you received a letter from the Scindia Steam Navigation Company? I am sure you will get one from them. I am eager to hear how you have progressed with this.

The preaching work is going on very well here. Someone wrote an article in the newspaper saying that, "In America people had the idea that God had either died or gotten lost, but Bhaktivedanta Swami, within three months, has explained to the atheist sampradaya that God is existing within Hari-kirtana." This is all a glorification of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Prabhupada and is fulfilling his desire with vijaya vaijayanti" (victory flag and garland.) I am very insignificant, so whichever way he is guiding me, I am doing that. Write to me soon and make me happy.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
