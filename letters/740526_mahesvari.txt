My dear Mahesvari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 11. I am very sorry that your husband Mahatma das has taken my letter to him in the wrong way and has told you to get married to another man although you are only 20 years old and have a 7 month old son. This is a most irresponsible and nonsensical proposal on his part. I never wrote or intended that he should leave you. He can stay out and distribute books on sankirtana, but for that he can remain grhastha, nor does it means he perpetually remains on sankirtana party forgetting his responsibilities. You write that you badly need your husbands instruction and security, therefore, this is natural, so he may go on sankirtana but he must also spend time with you as you require, not in the mood of sense gratification but for cooperation in Krsna Consciousness.

So you may take this letter to the president of the temple and he must do the needful so that Mahatma das does not set an irresponsible example. For your own part, do not be bewildered. Go on chanting Hare Krsna and simply trust in Krsna as the dearmost friend.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
