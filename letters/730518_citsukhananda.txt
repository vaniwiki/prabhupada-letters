====== Citsukhananda ======

<card class="letter">
Caracas

My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your Air Mail Special letter dated 14 of May, 1973, and I have noted the contents.

Tomorrow I am going to Dallas because the weather here in Los Angeles is not good for my health. It is too cold and cloudy. So I am going to Dallas to get some sunshine. If the weather there is not suitable, I may come at once to Caracas. However, if the weather is good in Dallas I shall remain there until May 30 and then to New Vrindaban for the corner stone laying for our first temple there. Then I shall come to Caracas from Pittsburgh.

Please let me know in Dallas whether or not you can make arrangements for tickets for four to Caracas.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have already come to Dallas and it appears nice 5/19/73\\
