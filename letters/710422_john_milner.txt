Tallahassee

My dear John Milner,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 4th April from Tallahassee, Florida and have noted the contents.

It is so much encouraging to hear how you are introducing this Krishna Consciousness Movement in the schools and colleges there. Especially this is an ideal opportunity for distributing our books also, so you should make all serious endeavor in this connection. These books are so potent that anyone who reads them is sure to become Krishna Conscious. So it is a very valuable service to distribute our books.

Yes, incense distribution has been very helpful in many centers for maintaining financially, but we are not businessmen. So producing candles for distribution is not at all necessary. We do not want to increase factories. We want to increase Krishna Consciousness and this can be done best by distributing our books and preaching. So in that way you can make your program.

So far as your going to Pakistan to join up with Brahmananda Maharaja, I have not heard from Brahmananda in some time. So whether or not he has arrived in Pakistan I cannot say. Neither does his good brother Gargamuni Maharaja knows for certain where he is. But if you can contact him and he agrees, then arrangements can be made.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
