My dear Bhakti Ballabh Tirtha:

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due receipt of your invitation card for the Annual Sri Krishna Janmastami Celebration and I thank you very much for it. I am here in Vrindaban where we are holding our Janmastami and Vyasa Puja ceremony at our Krishna Balarama Mandir.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am enclosing herewith a copy of the latest "Hare Krishna Explosion" which is published from our Hyderabad branch for your perusal.\\
