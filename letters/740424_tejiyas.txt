Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of April 11th, and April 22, 1974 and I have examined the contents.

I am enclosing the list of checks requested by you by Registered post except I am not sending one check for Rs 3,000 for deity clothes to be paid to the tailor Lalita Prasad of Vrindaban. Deity paraphernalia is supposed to be collected separately by Gurudasa and Yamuna, not come out of the construction fund as you have requested. Besides, I have advised Gurudasa not to pay any tailor but to make clothes by our own devotees for the deities.

According to my check book, after writing the last check no. 365504 for Rs 17,600.00 there is a balance of only Rs 18,745.81. But you are indicating a balance of Rs 100,313.64. Where is the difference? Send me a complete statement of account. You must have received a further Rs 50,000.00 by now from Bombay. Anyway, send me a statement of account so I can tally with my check book. Somehow I find a balance of only Rs 18,745.81.

As for the needs for construction over the next three months, one lac has been transferred to Delhi to the Vrindaban Temple Construction Fund and one lac is deposited in the Trust Fund; that makes two lacs. Plus, Birla will contribute Rs 50,000 per month. I am advising the Vrindaban Punjab National Bank to transfer to Delhi Vrindaban Temple Construction Fund a total of three lacs, see the enclosed letter to the bank. So I think this will solve your immediate construction needs for some time.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
