My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 23, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding Trivikrama Maharaja I have informed Madhudvisa Swami, who is the new GBC secretary in Australia and South Pacific zone, to write to Trivikrama and engage him for preaching work in that zone. But if there is difficulty for the temple in general to raise the money for his fare, then let Madhudvisa Swami supply his fare for going to help him in that zone. And any money that Trivikrama has collected he can turn over to you for getting that new temple in Tokyo city center.

That is a good idea, to invite many Indians and other influential Japanese men to visit our country asrama in Tokyo. There are many Indians in Tokyo and if you canvass them one by one gradually all of them will become our life members and support our activities for expanding widely in Japan. If we have got solid financial base there from the Hindu community, then we can go to all parts of Japan and open up centers and distribute our literature in Japanese language. So, try for this and I am fully convinced that you are all very sincere boys there and that your work will come out very very successful.

Hoping this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
