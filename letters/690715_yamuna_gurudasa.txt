====== Letter to: Yamuna, Gurudasa ======

My dear Yamuna and Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of Yamuna Dasi's letters of July 3rd and 7th, 1969, as well as Gurudasa' letters of July 1st, 4th and 8th, 1969. I have noted all the contents carefully, and I am so glad to know that you are arranging so nicely the temple paraphernalia as well as the Rathayatra Festival. You have got two great responsibilities to function. Do it to your best capacity, and Krishna will give you all facilities without fail. Our principle should be to serve Krishna very diligently with love and faith, and all necessary supplies will come without any difficulties. As you are all sincere devotees, I am sure you are feeling the great assistance of Krishna through your activities, and the more you serve the more you will know how you are making progress in Krishna Consciousness. The same example has to be repeated how when a hungry man is given foodstuffs to eat, automatically he feels three kinds of symptoms: satisfaction of hunger, strength and pleasure. So this Krishna Consciousness Movement is based on sincere service to the Lord. We shall always remember this, and then success is assured. I am glad that you are expecting me there during Janmastami Day, and this is a very nice proposal. Even if I go to Germany in the meantime, it will not be difficult for me to come to London during Janmastami Festival, which takes place on the 4th of September.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
