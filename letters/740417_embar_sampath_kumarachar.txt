Mysore State

My dear Embar Sampath Kumarachar:

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad you are coming to the U.S.A. You are welcome in any of our temples there. As you may know, our most important temples are in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Vrindaban, West Virginia, Philadelphia. So you are welcome to stay in any one of these temples and you can stay there as long as you like. I especially invite you to our children's school, Gurukula, in Dallas Texas. If you so desire you can take part there to take the post of head sanskrit teacher. As soon as you are in the U.S. go to Dallas.

This latter can be taken as sponsoring your stay in any temple; we will pay all charges for boarding and lodging.

Please send me five or six photos of yourself so I can send letters instructing my different branches as mentioned, so there will be no misunderstanding.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
