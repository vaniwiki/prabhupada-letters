====== Jayapataka ======

Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received also your letter of April 4, 1972, and everything seems to be going very nicely there in Mayapur, and also at Calcutta Temple. Four lakhs sounds like a reasonable price for that house. I have given you one lakh, ten thousand, already, so balance you try to raise funds, but if there is scarcity there will be no trouble, we shall supply. One thing is, as soon as you send me, jointly signed, a statement of how the money I gave you was spent, along with vouchers, then I can arrange more in future, as there may be some need to move swiftly before the monsoon comes. So try to do it very nicely, quickly, and sagaciously. Tamala Krishna can go also to my god-brother's math near Jessore, Bangladesh, as I have got a letter from him requesting our men to come there but they will not meet all expenses. His address is Bhakti Sambandha Turya Srami, c/o Gaudiya Math, Bordia, Jessore, Bangladesh. The pandal program at Mayapur should go on, along with prasada distribution. We are already on the top of all our godbrothers, that should be maintained. Invite all Hindus, Muslims, Jains, etc., without any discrimination, as we do in foreign countries, and continue the evening program. One thing, I have received on complaint from Damodara Maharaja that there was some quarrel with Acyutananda Maharaja. I do not know what is the fact, but we should avoid any quarrel with our godbrothers, and always be very nice and kind to them, and cooperate with them. Because Damodara Maharaja is offended, so Acyutananda Maharaja should go to Damodara and beg his forgiveness, and bow and touch his feet. There is no harm in such behavior of begging forgiveness. So far "Gita Gan," it should simply be composed there and sent to Japan c/o ISKCON Tokyo for printing. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
