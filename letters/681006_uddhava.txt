====== Uddhava ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 3, 1968, and I am so pleased to learn that you are now going to be photographic expert also for our press. It is all Krishna's arrangement. Please learn the art very nicely. So far financial assistance for starting our press, I am sure Krishna will help us. Don't worry about it. Simply just become expert in conducting the press.

Regarding binding: The cost of binding should not be more than 40 cents. And the best thing will be some of our students learn binding also. The book size of Srimad-Bhagavatam will be exactly as it is, at present, but it may be that the pages may be increased. Because next printing I am thinking three volumes in one. And the papers may be just like Bible paper, thin, and pages will be not less than 1000, and we shall print in one volume; the binding should be very first class, and similarly, part by part, we shall have to print 12 parts, altogether. So if some of our students becomes expert in binding, that will be very nice. I think Devananda, who is in Boston, he has some knowledge in binding. Binding is not very difficult task. Anyone can do it, but I do not know how it will be successfully done. But the cost of binding must not be more than 40 cents.

The Seattle center is going on very nicely, and most probably with our next center will be opened in Florida. I am so much thankful to you for your affection for me, and I pray to Krishna that you may make progress more and more in Krishna Consciousness. Thank you once more for writing me,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
