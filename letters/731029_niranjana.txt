Saugor, India

My dear Niranjana Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 17, 1973. I am glad that you like the Glasgow temple and that you are going there to preach. We want that the Indian people participate in this movement of Lord Caitanya.

My program is to go to Delhi on November 1 for our pandal program starting November 9. The new address there is: ISKCON, G 12 Anand Niketan Extension, New Delhi 110023. So you can come and see me there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
