====== Radhavallabha ======

Brooklyn

Dear Radhavallabha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter regarding the printing of the first volume of Caitanya Caritamrta.

As for introduction, you may use the Introduction I have already written and printed in Teachings of Lord Caitanya' I think it will also be suitable for Caitanya-caritamrta. As for dedication, please use the following:

"Presented to my friends and devotees who like to read my books and approached to request me to render the great Caitanya-caritamrta into English."

You have also inquired whether the picture of Lord Brahma and Visnu on the back cover of Srimad-Bhagavatam Third Canto volume one may be used. Yes, there is no objection to go on using it as it is.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
