====== Dixit ======

Bombay

My dear Dixit das;

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter dated August 26th, and have noted the contents. By the grace of Lord Nrsimhadeva I am improving in my health. I expect to be coming to Bombay as soon as Giriraja completes my new quarters on Hare Krishna Land. At that time I may see you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
