Governor of Uttar Pradesh\\
Raj Bhavan\\
Lucknow, U.P. INDIA

Dear Dr. Channa Reddy,

Please accept my best wishes. I thank you for your letter dated June 14, 1975 and have noted the contents carefully. As you are also touring very widely within India, I also am touring very widely all over the world. From Australia I went to Fiji, then to Honolulu, Hawaii. From there I went to Los Angeles, then Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, then again I have come to Los Angeles. Now I am going to San Diego, then Dallas, New Orleans, Detroit, Toronto, Montreal, New York, and then to New Vrindaban, West Virginia.

So far our Bombay temple is concerned, I have received one telegram from my secretary there stating: “NOC FOR TEMPLE OBTAINED.” It is understood that the present Chief Minister Sri S.B. Chavan is a kind gentleman who is religiously disposed, and he has kindly given the order of NOC.

I do not know the latest news about Bombay, but I hope they may begin the construction work as soon as they get the Municipal sanction.

Regarding my project in Kurukshetra, I have sent one letter to Sriman Gulzari Lal Nanda, the copy of which is enclosed herewith. I have received no reply as yet, maybe on account of my heavy tour program. So when I get some opportunity I shall take the advantage of constructing a temple and Varna-ashrama College as soon as possible. Then your help will be certainly required.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
