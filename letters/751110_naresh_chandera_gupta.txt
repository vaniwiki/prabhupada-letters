My dear Sriman Naresh Chandera,

Please accept my blessings. I am very thankful for your letter in appreciation of our Krishna consciousness movement. You will be very much useful in this great movement. Please immediately come to Bombay at the above address and we shall talk in detail and do the needful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
