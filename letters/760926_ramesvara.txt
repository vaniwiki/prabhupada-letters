My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 17th inst. including two transfer receipts for $70,000 from BBT to B/A Bombay a/c and $1900 rent to M/V a/c LA.

Regarding the Fiji situation, your solution to amend the constitution is nice. Let Vasudeva become president. Your idea to sell BTGs, collect donations, hold kirtana and distribute prasada profusely, yes, do that. I was given the impression that this temple was to be controlled by the Punja family and our devotees would not have any hand. This was the impression given. We want that a very nice relationship be kept with Vasudeva. It was wanted that he follows our instructions including following the GBC, so that everything can go on nicely. Let one brother be president and one treasurer, and give one good man who can act as secretary. I have not lost confidence in Vasudeva. Now the matter is clear---I'm very much pleased with him so let him remain president and that will please him more, and his brother treasurer with one secretary. If the temple remains permanently in ISKCON Fiji's name and cannot be sold, that is very nice; it is not for selling, it is for improving more and more.

Local men must understand our philosophy, then it will be very successful. We cannot import men from outside. We sincerely want that local men either from Vasudeva's family or any other family which will take on the work. We have to work on that line. Just like some of my Godbrothers wanted to take men from India to London but the attempt was a failure---but when I trained up local men then it was successful. I have no objection if the whole Vasudeva Punja family be trained up and take charge of the temple. Local men should not simply become a visitor but they should be trained up to take charge of the temple. That is what I want. As soon as one is a devotee there is no personal ambition---life is dedicated for Krishna.

If my books can be translated and published there, I have no objection. Since Tamala and yourself are there for some time everything will be alright. Vasudeva must be president. Gurukrpa is feeling inconvenience regarding Australia because of the long distance. His interest is mainly Japan. You or another man may take care of Australia.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
