====== Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. Your nice letter of 8/18 in hand; your nice philosophy that Krishna takes and Krishna gives, is very nice. This means Krishna is not impersonal. He is the Supreme Person and fully reciprocates. The impersonalist cannot reciprocate. Krishna does not take anything from them, neither does He give them anything. The Impersonal, therefore, simply enjoys the troubles of speculation. I have received news from Sante Fe that they have opened a nice branch there in an old castle, and it is very much pleasing to me. Now Kirtanananda Swami is going very soon to the U.S.A., and I expect that all of you will combine together to open at least 108 centers before I leave this world. I hope by this time you have seen Mr. Nehru; I am anxiously awaiting your report. I am also glad to learn that MacMillan is going to publish our books, and are including Gita and Bhagavatam on their spring lists. So I shall not bother to arrange for printing in India. Please confirm this.

I am going to Delhi next week (Sept 5), and may not be returning to Vrindaban, so please direct all mail from now on to P.O. Box 1846, D Delhi 6. The 10.00 dollars monthly contribution from each center will be a nice resource for development of the Vrindaban House. I am so much pleased to learnt that you are getting a car from a friend; now please take care of it carefully. Offer my blessings to all the devotees.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
