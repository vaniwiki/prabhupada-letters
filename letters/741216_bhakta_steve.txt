My dear Bhakta Steve,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 28, 1974 and have noted the contents.

It is very nice that you have joined the Radha-Damodara travelling Sankirtana party and that you are engaged in spreading the message of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu along with Visnujana Swami and Tamala Krsna Goswami. I think it would be very nice if you would make nice silver jewellery for the Radha-Damodara Deities and in this way your talent will be used in the most perfect way. Please continue reading our books with great care, studying again and again and staunchly following all of our regulative principles and always stay in the association of devotees, chanting Hare Krishna.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
