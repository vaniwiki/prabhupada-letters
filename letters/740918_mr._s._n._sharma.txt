Dear Sir:

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due receipt of your letter in Hindi and have noted the contents. To join our mission first of all you have to become a pure Vaisnava. For this purpose you have to remain with us and live the techniques in your life. Then you can be trained up as a preacher. We do not allow anyone become a preacher unless he is strictly following the Vaisnava principles of no eating meat, fish, or eggs; no sex outside of marriage; no gambling; and no taking any kind of intoxication whatsoever. You must also chant 16 rounds Hare Krishna on the japa beads.

So if you are interested, you can practice these things within our association for some time. Then we shall consider you for preaching work.

I hope this meets you well.

Faithfully yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
