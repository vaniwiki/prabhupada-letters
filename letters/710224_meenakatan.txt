====== Meenakatan ======

Hamilton, Ontario; Canada

My dear Meenakatan,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your kind letter dated 1st February, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear that you are now at our Hamilton center and how much our movement is being appreciated there. So work enthusiastically along with Dharmaraj and the others to push on this movement and to make Hamilton temple a grand success. Krishna is there in your heart and the more you surrender to Him, the more He takes charge, and seeing your sincerity, He will give you all facility for increasing your service more and more.

You write to say that you are too much absorbed in temporal thoughts of sex life. If that is the case, then perhaps you should get yourself married. In Krishna Consciousness we do not artificially repress any desires, but that everything can be used in Krishna's service is our philosophy. My Guru Maharaja made sannyasis to go out and preach this movement and I am making householder couples and they are doing so nicely to spread Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's message. So if you are so inclined and you can find a suitable girl, then you have my permission to get yourself married.

Your name is Meenakatan. Meenakatan was a great devotee of Lord Nityananda.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
