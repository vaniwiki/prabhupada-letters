My dear Vrindaban,

Please accept my blessings. With further reference to my letter dated 7/4/76, I beg to enclose herewith a "true copy" of the receipt by Punjab National Bank. You can go immediately to see the bank manager and do the needful.

It is signed (signature illegible) by a bank official and it has the official stamp of the Punjab National Bank dated 5/3/71.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
