My dear Alfred,

Please accept my blessings. I am writing this letter to inform you that Sudama Swami has left our camp. He has his own plans. He has violated our rules and regulations and thus fallen down from the spiritual platform. Under these circumstances, please do not act under his advice. I have been very much busy here in Bombay. In about a week, I am going to come to Honolulu. I will notify you of my definite arrival date and I request that you please come and see me there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
