My dear Sanka das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated. I understand from Bhavananda Maharaja that you are invited here to plant a garden. So when you come your questions can be discussed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
