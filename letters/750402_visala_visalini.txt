Mayapur

My dear Visala and Visalini,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated March 27th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your kind donation of 501 rs. My simple request to both of you is that you continue to endeavor sincerely in Krishna Consciousness, being very careful to follow all of our principles very seriously and try to co-operate fully with this Hare Krishna movement in spreading the message of Lord Caitanya all over the world.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
