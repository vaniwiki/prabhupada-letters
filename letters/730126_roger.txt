My dear Roger,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 5, 1973, and have noted the contents.

Thank you very much for your kind sentiments. By engaging in this Krsna Consciousness Movement you will be perfecting your own life as well as helping others to also come to the platform of God-consciousness. This is the real business of human life, though unfortunately the majority of human beings are neglecting. Now it is our business to wake them up to Krsna Consciousness. Please read my books very carefully and become convinced on this point. Chant Hare Krsna, take prasadam, and follow the regulative principles very rigidly. This will make you more and more advanced in spiritual life.

I hope this finds you in good spirits.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
