====== Damodara ======

My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 9th, 1970, and noted the contents.

I am very glad to note your careful understanding of Krsna Science. It is a fact that there is no one who can claim to be happy who is not in Krsna's service favorably rendered. All others are simply entangled in the tight circle of sense gratification. However, the Lord is very kind to us and He has appeared for renovating the devotional service dormant in the hearts of all living entities in the matter of hearing, remembering, worshiping, etc. So that the conditioned souls suffering from material pangs may take advantage of them and thereby become liberated.

It is very good news that your Washington Temple is now expanded with devotees and you are increasing your program regularly. I am especially eager that all our books may be distributed to all the libraries and school-colleges of the world and so far the program of distribution has met with good success everywhere. So you also do it thoroughly with the help of your assistants. The university community is also a prime target for our propaganda work and I am most pleased to know that classes are being regularly taught at the universities and other classes are using our books as texts. You are one of our intelligent devotees, so please try your best to convince the students of the necessity for chanting Hare Krsna Mahamantra.

I am very much happy that you have added worship of Srimati Tulasi devi to your Temple activities. That is most auspicious. However, you should not try to speculate on the "level of consciousness" of the pure devotee of the Lord. In the material condition of life the consciousness of the living entity is covered over in varying degrees by the material energy in the form of sensuous body and subtle mind. But the consciousness of the pure devotee is not limited by the influence of maya and so it is never to be speculated in that way.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife and to all the Prabhus there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
