====== Letter to: Upendra ======

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of October 24, 1968, and due to constant change of addresses I could not reply earlier. Your desire for India should be suspended for the time being because formerly I thought that there would be development of a branch of our institution in Vrndavan, and the matter was entrusted to Achyutananda, but we could not give it practical shape till now. Neither I have any hope he will be able to do it. Now he proposes to come back. But the Samkirtan party which is developing may hope one day to travel over the world, and in that case, your service will be required. The present Samkitan party now working in Los Angeles is scheduled to join the London party in due course, and if it is successful there, they may propose to make a world tour, which certainly will be a glorious work. And at that time our tour in India will be very successful.

In Seattle, also you try to move in Samkirtan party as Tamal Krishna was doing, and it is good proposal that the girls may take charge of the temple in cleaning the temple house, and worship the Deities, and cook prasadam while you are in work outside. Please try to develop the Seattle center which is practically in your charge, and let me know at least once in a week about your activities there. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
