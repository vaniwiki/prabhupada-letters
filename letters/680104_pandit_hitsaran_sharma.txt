====== Letter to: Pandit Hitsaran Sharma ======

In exchange of the books supplied if you want printing materials like machines, etc., I am sure you will get import license. And I will send you from here things as you need them. Let us cooperate fully in the service of Lord Krishna.

I am glad to know that you have moved to your new buildings and (and) hope everything (everthing) is happy now. I hope Srimati Bahuji is now doing well and so also your blessed son. Kindly reply my letters promptly and oblige. Hope you are well and thanking you once more.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
