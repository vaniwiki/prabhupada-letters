====== Letter to: Gurudasa ======

Frankfurt

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14/11/76.

I am very happy to hear that you are going to Poland. Bharadraja also speaks Polish. He may come there sometimes if it can be arranged. Sri Garbha's wife doesn't have to go to Mayapur, she may go to the farm in France. it is very nice there. Or she may go to any of our farms. The preaching in Poland is the first consideration. Vrindaban is being managed somehow by others. Aksayananda has one man who is collecting very well (Rs. 15,000-20,000 per month) Vrindaban is becoming self-dependent. If you can preach vigorously in Poland it will be a great asset. You may come to Vrindaban if you like, but preaching in Poland is my greater interest. So, now Vrindaban is somehow being managed. Now the most important work is that side in the Communist countries. If you can do something there, it is more than if you come here. Our business is to glorify Krsna as the Lord of Vrndavana and to popularize Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's Hare Krsna Movement. I was a resident in Vrndavana, but at the age of 70 I tried to preach Krsna consciousness a little bit and now this Institution has come out. So, I think it is more profitable to preach about the Master of Vrndavana, Krsna, outside of Vrndavana. A devotee of Krsna can create Vrndavana everywhere by preaching the glories of Krsna.

There are many sahajiyas who imitate Rupa Goswami not to go out of Vrndavana, but Caitanya Mahaprabhu remained always outside Vrndavana for preaching purposes, although He is is the master of Vrndavana personally. I have no objection to your coming to Vrndavana, but as you have accepted the sannyasa order, it is more important to preach about Vrndavana rather than to come to Vrndavana. I am getting older and older and it is getting difficult for me, therefore I am requesting all my younger disciples to preach all over the world. Otherwise, you are always welcome in Vrndavana. I have no objection.

I am a little hopeful that if we preach in the communist countries, they will like it. According to our Vaisnava philosophy even a snake or lizard is in the house shall not go without eating, what to speak of other living entities. The communists have an idea for feeding human society, but our idea is expanding. We want to see even a snake not fasting.

If somebody wants to go to Bangkok it will be very good. The address there is: ISKCON CENTER, 17 Amorn Soi 2 Sukumvit 49, Bangkok, Thailand. In charge there now is Rajni dasi.

Alex, who was just here, told me he has given you the money for my house as well as some for purchasing a bus. The house construction money can be sent to American Express International Banking Corporation in Calcutta. The account number is S/B a/c no. 5416. It is in the name Sri A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami (ISKCON). Please send one copy of the deposit notice to me.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
