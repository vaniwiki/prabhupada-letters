My dear Bali-mardana Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, with newspaper clipping, dated nil.

I can understand that actually Hayagriva was not involved directly in the management of Back to Godhead and that whatever arrangement you already have there is sufficient. Meanwhile Hayagriva can be encouraged to continue his literary contribution of articles, editing of the smaller books, etc. We shall see what he can do, and if at all possible he should be brought back to the standard. In this connection I have written his wife, Kirtanananda Swami, and the GBC members. Thus far I have received no reply regarding Madhudvisa's suggestion about Hrdayananda from the GBC members.

You have been to India so you know the importance of the life membership program here, so I am requesting that you personally attend to some items needed here for the preaching work in that connection. Rupanuga is writing the specifics to you under separate cover.

I have received from Kirtiraja the specifics and plans of your proposed building, the Columbia Club property, and it is ideal for all of our purposes so I am anxious to hear of any progress in securing it.

I am approving of second initiation for Hari-puja dasi as you requested.

My plans are to go to Mayapur as soon as they have finished my quarters and to remain there until the 22nd.

Thank you very much for the mostly favorable newspaper article and I hope this meets you in good mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
