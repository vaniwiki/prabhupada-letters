====== Letter to: Jagadisa ======

My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated October 3, 1969, sent along with a maintenance check of $15. Regarding the information you heard that it is all right to neglect one's 16 rounds as a daily minimum, this is wrong. Everyone should strictly follow the regulations of 16 rounds daily. If one is busy for other Krishna Consciousness activities and cannot fulfill the regular routine of chanting, he must compensate it the next day, curtailing his activities in the matter of sleeping or eating or any other sense gratificatory process. So far as how long each day to go out on Sankirtana Party, Caitanya Mahaprabhu prescribes to chant Hare Krishna Mantra 24 hours. So if you can do so, it is very nice. Otherwise, as much as possible. Sankirtana is our life and soul.

I am very glad that Jaya Hari Dalmia was in the temple, and I hope you received him well. His father is a great friend of my activities. When I was in India he helped me so many times with financial assistance, so he is sympathetic. I am very glad that his daughter-in-law has presented some saris and the boy has presented some books. Please keep the books nicely. None of you will be able to understand Hindi or Sanskrit, so when I return to USA I shall ask you for these books. Regarding the picture of Lord Caitanya which is outside of your temple, this is not good. We should not place our worshipable Deities as statues in the open atmosphere.

I have also received one very nice letter from your good wife, Laksmimoni. She is a very nice girl, so the two of you work combinedly to spread this Sankirtana Movement of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. That will bring all happiness and success to both of your lives.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
