Dear Sri Murthy,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8/11/75, and have noted the contents. At present I am at Bombay and you are welcome to come and see me and we shall discuss these things broadly. And if possible I am prepared to go to Bharatapur and speak my views on spiritual advancement of life.

So for our guidance Krsna has spoken everything in Bhagavad-gita. Unfortunately so-called scholars and saintly persons have misguided the people by making different interpretations of the divine instruction unnecessarily. That is the cause of the ruination of our culture in India.

There is all round guidance in Bhagavad-gita for social, political, religious, educational, cultural and philosophical and in all matters of guidance, but instead of taking guidance from Bhagavad-gita, they are now enamored by the external feature of modern civilization. It is said therefore, na te viduh svartha gatim hi visnuh: "They do not know that the supreme self-interest is to know Visnu."

I am very glad to see that you have detected the deficiency in our educational system, but still there is time before complete ruination if we take seriously this Krsna Consciousness Movement.

If you can, come here, we shall provide for your staying here for some time. We have got guest rooms and arrangements for prasadam.

I hope this meets you well.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
