<card class="letter">
Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Vasudeva das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 18, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

I am requesting the BBT in Los Angeles to forward you the books which you require. There is no need to deal through Australia. You can place your order directly to Ramesvara Maharaja and I am also notifying him to fill your order immediately so that your preaching work goes on there.

Concerning the Deities, I have commissioned Bharadraja in Los Angeles to make them for Fiji, however if anyone else is able to do it nicely and cheaply then it is alright. You can correspond with Bharadraja in Los Angeles concerning this matter.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. I have also sent a reminder to Aksayananda Swami in Vrindaban to send the dimensions of the altar and Vyasasana of the Krishna Balarama Temple. I trust that you will receive this shortly.
