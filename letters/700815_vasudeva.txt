My dear Vasudeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5th August, 1970. I am very glad to know that you are very fully engaged in the duties of chanting regularly 16 rounds, going out on Sankirtana, performing arcana for the Deities and painting.

It is very encouraging for me to learn that you are so enthusiastic in the execution of your devotional services. So please be engaged 24 hours daily in sincere transcendental loving service of the Lord and your life in Krsna consciousness is sure to be successful. Many of our Temples are now requiring pictures of Pancatattva and Acaryas, principally your Spiritual Master and my Spiritual Master, for their Guru Gauranga worship. So I am confident that you can help them in this connection by painting many of these very important pictures of our Temples. No we have got so many new branches of our Society, so your assignment is already given to provide them in this way with paintings.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
