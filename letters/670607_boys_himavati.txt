====== Boys, Himavati ======

Montreal

My dear boys and Himavati,

I have duly received your kind letters and it was so pleasing to me that you are all sincere souls in Krishna Consciousness. I am making progress very nicely and tomorrow I shall be discharged from the hospital, to go to New Jersey to take rest for a fortnight in front of the natural sea. The basic principle of Krishna Consciousness is to receive one and all as our Master, and serve them with prasadam as diet and Krishna Kirtana as medicine for being free from materially diseased condition. So we shall follow this principle and Krishna will help us on our onward march.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
