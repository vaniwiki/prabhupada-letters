====== Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find tape no. 3. Kindly acknowledge receipt, and date of receipt also. After finishing with these tapes, they should be sent directly to Pradyumna in N.Y. for sanskrit, along with a copy of the finished transcript. He can forward the tapes to me.

Also please find a poem presented to me in Bombay by one French boy, Darsha. If you like, you can publish it in Back to Godhead.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
