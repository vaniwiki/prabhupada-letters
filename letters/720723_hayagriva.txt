My dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 17, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, I shall do as you have requested by informing Karandhar that henceforward he should send you $125 monthly, beginning 1st August, 1972, but if you again ask me for increase in expense then I shall have to ask you to take sannyas! You may submit to Karandhar your expenditures and receipts, and he shall do the needful. I am coming to Pittsburgh and New Vrindaban by end of August from Nairobi, and I look forward to seeing you then. Meanwhile I await Photostat copies of the property deeds.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
