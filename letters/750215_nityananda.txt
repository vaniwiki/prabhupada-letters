====== Letter to: Nityananda ======

New Orleans

My dear Nityananda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 5th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to hear that your farm project in Mississippi is going on nicely. Develop it nicely like New Vrndavana.

I have accepted the two persons that you have recommended for 1st initiation. Their names are Michael---Muniraja, and Robin---Rajanatha. Their beads can be chanted by Kirtanananda Swami. Train them to be first class devotees by following very strictly all of our rule regulations, chanting at least 16 good rounds daily.

Thank you for the 100 dollars donation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
