====== Satsvarupa, Jadurani ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of Oct. 28, 1968, along with Jadurani's. There is some difficulty of our temple here, therefore my return address is given to my residential apartment, as above. So you can write me letters to this address. I hope the enclosed statement of certificate of your being an ordained Brahmin will help you.

As mentioned in the letter, you will be pleased to know that I am now admitted as ordained minister of religion in the USA. Now there is no difficulty of my staying in your country and if the students in different universities and colleges want to hear from me about the teachings of Lord Caitanya, Bhagavad-gita As It Is, and Srimad-Bhagavatam, I shall be glad to accept such invitation, provided such students pay reasonable contributions. I am getting gradually older, therefore even if I remain in your country, I shall restrain my moving and my main business will be henceforward to train you all my disciples for preaching work. I think you will approve of my program. Hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your handwriting letter after so long a time, and from your handwriting I can understand that Krishna is keeping you in good health. You must take care of your health, and under the direction of your good husband. I have especially entrusted you in his hand so that he may take proper care of your health, and everyone is pleased about your nice combination. Both of you are very serious students in Krishna Consciousness and on account of your service %%__%%, Krishna always will help you in all respects.

I confirm herewith my statement that the wife is the shareholder of the husband's pious activities. So you should know it well that Sriman Satsvarupa, life being fully dedicated to Krishna, whatever he desires you to act, you should kindly follow his instruction. Actually he cannot check you in the matter of your service either to Krishna or to me, but because we have to work with our present body, we must take care of it by following the ordinary rules.

Regarding casting of Nrsimhadeva murtis, I could not follow what you mean by this. I know Rukmini can paint, so if she paints Nrsimhadeva pictures, let her do this as many copies as she can. So far casting in metal or in any other solid material is concerned, if she is able to do it, let her do the job in casting Radha Krishna murtis. We require many Radha Krishna murtis both in our temples as well as in private household homes. Yes, that is a nice idea to copy photos of lotuses and flowers.

Yes, because in our temples there is no picture of Srila Gaura Kisora Das Babaji or Srila Jagannatha Das Babaji, so you can paint Their pictures. If you have no picture to copy from, you can write and request Gurudasa to send you some. I am enclosing herewith a small picture of Madhvacarya, if it is too difficult to work from, you can send it to Gurudasa and he can make clearer and larger prints from it.

Hoping you are in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
