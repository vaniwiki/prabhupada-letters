====== Upendra ======

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of May 4, 1967 and I am concerned about your %%__%% for army mobilization. I am enclosing herewith a letter you may present to the authority and as a Divinity Student you must not be sent to the field. Chant Hare Krishna. Krishna will save you. Present our prospectus and all newspaper cuttings. Some new cuttings I am enclosing herewith. Also I would request you to pay the rent on room in which I was staying. The Society is short of %%__%% and therefore you can assure Haridasa, Mukunda and Syamasundara, that hence forward you should take responsibility for the rent of my apartment.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enclosure: 4
