====== S. N. Sharma ======

Dehradan, India

My dear S.N. Sharma,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14/11/76.

I am here at least for another fortnight, so if you can come immediately it will be very kind of you. We have good accommodation and good prasadam for you. You can just bring your clothing and personal needs. It will be a great pleasure for me to talk to you on the various topics you are interested in. It will be best if you can come immediately upon receipt of this letter.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
