====== Rupanuga ======

Dela Plain, Virginia

My dear Rupanuga das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 21, 1975 and have noted the contents. It is not good that all of the temples are spending more than they are receiving. They should rather save more and not exceed on the expenditures. I do not think that the jewelry business should be encouraged. We are after preaching, not money. Their endeavor should be utilized for selling books. That is different from the endeavor of selling jewelry. I do not think that this attempt should be encouraged. Our principle is __tyaga,__ or renunciation, which means to renounce material activities as far as possible. What plans are there for the book distribution for the bicentennial celebration in Philadelphia?

Regarding Baltimore, again deficit. This is not a good sign. Regarding the Sankirtana Newsletter, then stop it. If the BBT does not pay for it, then stop it. The temple cannot afford to publish it, and if the BBT does not pay for it, then stop it. But it is good attempt.

Regarding Atlanta, everywhere again expenditures more. Why was the airport distribution closed down in Atlanta? I am glad that their farm project is successful. Milk, fruits, flowers and also food grains can all be produced in the farm. Cannot flowers be produced in the farm? This will reduce their expenditure and tulasi also.

It is good that the New York income was more than the expenditures. The description of my room there in the new building sounds very nice.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
