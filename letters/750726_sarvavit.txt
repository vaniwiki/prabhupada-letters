My dear Sarvavit dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 15th, and I am very glad to read the contents. I am glad to learn that you are getting good training by Cyavana Maharaja and you should take your post of temple president as a very serious matter. It is your responsibility to always exhibit a Krsna conscious example. You should always be thinking how to spread Krsna consciousness to the African people. This is our mission---to save suffering humanity from the path of repeated birth and death. The way to become free is only by becoming pure devotee of Krsna. You should simply stick to our principles and everything will come out all right in our preaching work. You should publish profusely literature in Swahili and distribute. This is very important. This mission has been established simply on the publishing and distribution of my books. So get them translated and published as soon as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
