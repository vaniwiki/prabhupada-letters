====== Ksirodakasayi ======

London

My dear Ksirodakasayi das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 28, 1974 and have noted the contents. Yes, the Mahabharata is an authoritative book. It is considered the fifth veda. But, quotations must be given from the original Mahabharata.

Regarding your question on demigod worship, there are so many demigods, and the qualities may be overlapping. Demigod worship is meant for materialistic men whether in goodness, passion, or ignorance. Those in the transcendental position above the qualities of the material world worship Visnu. Most people do not know that Visnu is the ultimate aim of worship. The varna-asrama system is organized with this purpose, to worship Visnu. So far we are concerned, we never recommend to worship any demigod either in goodness, passion or ignorance.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
