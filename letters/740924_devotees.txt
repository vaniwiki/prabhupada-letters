====== Devotees ======

My dear Devotees:

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter received at Vrindaban and your prayers for my health. By your prayers and by your chanting Hare Krishna, and by the grace of Lord Nrsimhadeva I am recovered from the serious illness.

So let us go on with the spreading of this sublime cult of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu all over the world. My only request is that you all remain enthusiastic and pure by strictly following all the rules and regulations and the devotional practices of chanting 16 rounds.

I hope this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
