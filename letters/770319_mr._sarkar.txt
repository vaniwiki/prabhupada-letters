====== Mr. Sarkar ======

My dear Mr. Sarkar,

Please accept my blessing. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 10th March, 1977. My health is improving by the grace of Krishna, and I am leaving for Bombay by the 22nd instant. Thank you very much for your concern.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
