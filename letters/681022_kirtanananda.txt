====== Kirtanananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. While I am packing my goods for going to Montreal I have received your letter of Oct. 18, 1968. Yes, when Krishna has given us New Vrindaban, it must develop rest assured. You have got very good engagement by the Grace of Krishna, do it nicely and your life will be glorious and successful. So also Hayagriva's. When you go to Columbus take Radha Krishna with you and teach Hayagriva also how to worship the Deities. If required, ask Acyutananda and Jaya Govinda to send you another pair of Deity for Hayagriva. Radhakrishna shall be your life companion and thus you will be always secure from the attack of Maya. So also Hayagriva. The present mode of worship is quite alright, don't worry. You have seen in Vrindaban so do follow as much as possible. Decorate the Deity as nicely as possible with nice flowers and dress. You will forget all other false beauty. Open the Columbus center gorgeously along with Hayagriva and Pradyumna. The boys will like it. Carry Deity with you. Krishna is so nice. He is carrying the whole planetary system as Sankarsana, but at the same time, He agrees to be carried by His devotees as small as a devotee can carry Him. He is greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest. His greatness is there even when He becomes small to be carried by a devotee. The Mayavadis cannot understand how the greatest can become the smallest as it is impossible on material understanding. I am going to Montreal to meet the consulate of USA for my permanent visa. Let me see what Krishna desires. Hope you are well. Offer my blessings to all.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
