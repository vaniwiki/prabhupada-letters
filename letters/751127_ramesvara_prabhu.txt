====== Ramesvara Prabhu ======

My dear Ramesvara Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letters dated November 18th and 20th 1975. I have noted the contents carefully.

The incident with Purusottama is now a closed chapter, in the future be more careful, we have got enemies as well as friends, we have to be careful.

I was very happy to receive the new edition of Bhagavad gita the make up is very nice. Every time I see a new publication of my books it gives me so much enthusiasm that my life is increased by 100 years. Thank you for helping me so much.

The report of Ghanasyama Prabhu selling standing orders to the head of the Mormon church is very encouraging to me, may Krishna bless this boy. Practically speaking there is no religion in the world, the only true religion is Bhagavata Dharma, that is the original religion of the human society, whatever else there may be passing as religion has come after Vedic literature. The whole world is in darkness, so we are bringing light in the shape of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Therefore this is the best service one can render to the human society, to give knowledge, how to go back to home back to Godhead.

The BTG No. 12 is also nice. In India the biggest circulated spiritual magazine is Kalyana printed by Gita press at 95,000 so you have far surpassed them, thank you, the magazine is very nice.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
