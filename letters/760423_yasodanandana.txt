Hyderabad

My dear Yasodanandana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14 April, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning the printing of the Brahmasamhita, I have informed Ramesvara Maharaja that the BBT Trustees can discuss this, and if they approve it, then I have no objection. You have stated that you would also assist in the printing costs. I can write an introduction to the book if it is approved by the others to go ahead and print it.

On your recommendation I agree to the second initiation of Jagaman das Brahmacari. Impress upon him the seriousness to follow the regulative principles strictly, keeping clean outside and inside by constantly chanting Hare Krishna. You can hold fire yajna and play a tape of the chanting of Gayatri Mantra into the right ear.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
