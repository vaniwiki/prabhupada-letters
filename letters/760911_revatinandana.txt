====== Revatinandana ======

Laguna Beach

My dear Revatinandana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 13 August 1976 and have noted the contents with care. On your recommendation I am accepting Simhesvara das brahmacari as brahmana and his thread is enclosed within. The name of Tyaga dasa may be given to Terry Gardner and the name Sarana devi dasa may be given to Sandra Joaquim.

The newly initiated brahmana may hear the mantra from the tape in the right ear at the time of the fire sacrifice which you may perform and the thread is enclosed within. The names of the first initiates may also be given at that time. Their beads may be chanted upon by Ramesvara Maharaja the GBC for your temple.

Please impress upon the initiates the necessity of chanting 16 rounds daily on the beads and following the four regulative principles. And the brahmanas must become clean outside by taking bath regularly and inside by chanting the maha mantra. Avoid sinful life and spiritual life becomes easier. Without following these principles there is actually no possibility of spiritual life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
