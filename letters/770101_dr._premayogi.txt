My dear Premayogi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and some samples of your literary work.

Regarding your coming to the Kumbha Mela, yes you may definitely come. Arrangements are being made now for our camp there and you will be accommodated there. I shall go there around the 10th or 12th. You may come by the 14th.

So far your literary work is concerned, the style is nice. We can discuss further when we meet at Kumbha Mela.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
