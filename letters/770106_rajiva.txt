Delhi

My dear Rajiva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3/1/77 and have noted the contents.

Yes you may translate Bhagavad-gita. You're so enthusiastic. Krsna will give you strength. The more you serve the more you'll get strength.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
