====== Bali-mardana ======

New York

Dear Bali-mardana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 18, 1973 with enclosed photostat of Caitanya-caritamrta which I am looking over.

Regarding the purchase of the building, I wish that unless the Columbia Club sells the building that you do not move from the present building. You proposed to move to another building but I do not appreciate this idea. Go directly to the Columbia Club building. So finish your dealings with Columbia Club managers and we can purchase and move directly there. I am praying to Krsna that He will favor you with that new house for conducting His preaching work.

Now we are going to install nice Radha-Krsna Deities here in our new Letchmore Heath Temple on Janmastami Day, August 22nd 1973. The thing is there are no nice paintings immediately available for the Temple room here. So I want you to remove all of the paintings that are presently hanging in my rooms at Brooklyn Temple and dispatch them to Letchmore Heath or London immediately by air mail. The temple room is very large, I think about 70 feet by 30 feet, so many paintings are required to decorate it nicely. Therefore all of those paintings in my rooms are required and if you can send me besides additional of the newer paintings that will be your great contribution.

I am awaiting anxiously your report on the meeting with the Japan emperor.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: As to when I shall be able to go to Japan, I am going to L.A. by the end of August. In September I will stay in L.A. Then whenever you call me at Japan I shall be able to go. Thirty lakhs rupees will solve the problem of India.
