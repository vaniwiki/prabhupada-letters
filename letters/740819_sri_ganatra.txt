====== Sri Ganatra ======

Bombay

My dear Sri Ganatra,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for greeting telegram from Bombay dated Aug 12th on the occasion of Vyasa Puja. You may know that we have had to postpone the opening of the temples due to the temple and asrama not being completed. This is due to difficulty in getting cement. They are expecting to complete the temple for the opening ceremony by three months time. Then we can have our opening ceremony.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
