My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22 July 1973 and herewith please find another two checks. 11-66/1210 No. 143 for $100.00 and 24-191/1230 No. 298 for $150.00 which you please deposit in my investment account No. 8-80613 Bank Branch 366.

Regarding the book transaction with the company Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. I see that you have already some correspondence with them. On the whole I see that the agreement is not good. So you can do the needful in this connection.

Presently we are staying in Paris, coming here on the 9th and going back to London on the 15th August 1973. Yesterday we installed the Deities Sri Sri Radha and Krishna and the ceremony was very nice.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
