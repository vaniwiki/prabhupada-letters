====== Letter to: Morris Lapidus ======

My dear Morris Lapidus,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 29, 1976.

Since we have already moved to our new location and everything is going on according to our standard program, we cannot possibly think of moving again or purchasing another building. Actually it is out of the question altogether.

If you have any further questions in this regard, please consult with Madhudvisa Swami as I have instructed you in my last letter.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
