====== Giriraja ======

My dear Giriraja Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 8/10/76 and have noted the contents carefully.

Yes, you can do as you have suggested, reply in the monthly news letter to the members, followed by the reply I sent to Smt. Morarji.

Your preaching in the colleges is nice, try to make some Indian devotees.

I am enclosing two letters to the Bank of America for renewing the fixed deposits, see that it is done and inform me what has been done about the receipt I left for renewal when I was there last. Also one letter to Ramakrishna Bajaj, do the needful.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
