My dear Mrs. Scott,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 19th, 1974 and have noted the contents. If you like, you may contact the temple president in Paris and find out from him if he thinks it is a good idea for you to go there. Please chant 16 rounds and follow the 4 regulative principles strictly and read my books with great care.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
