====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna, Visnujana ======

My dear Tamala Krishna and Visnujana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your long letter dated February 10, 1969, along with Purusottama's letter of the same date, and I shall reply conveniently. In the meantime, I am enclosing herewith the certificates and letters duly signed by me, and as you need them urgently I am dispatching them first.

Regarding the mangos: Govinda dasi misled me---the mangos are not yet ripened. There are many mango trees, but the fruit will not be ripened until late May or June. So for now there is no abundant supply of nice mangos. So I shall soon be returning to the mainland for my engagements in New York, in Boston, and elsewhere.

Hope this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
