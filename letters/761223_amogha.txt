My dear Amogha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very long letter dated 2 December, 1976.

I have no objection to your working there in Australia. If you are happy there and can execute devotional service with enthusiasm that is nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
