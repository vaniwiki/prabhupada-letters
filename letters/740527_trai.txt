My dear Trai das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 25, 1974.

Upon your recommendation I have accepted Neal Buyers as my initiated disciple and his new spiritual name is Niranjana dasa. Keep him carefully now. Krsna Consciousness means to create ideal men, so you must set the example in following the rules and chanting Hare Krsna mantra and see that others are doing it also.

I am enclosing brahmana threads and gayatri mantra for Ādi Kesava das and Vivasvan das. You must be very careful before you award the brahminical thread by recommending a man to me. Now that we are dividing our society into the four orders as much as possible, it is not that every man has to be made a brahmana after a year. Especially if one cannot even get up early and go to mangala arati he cannot become a brahmana. So consider it carefully before you recommend further men to me. Sometime in the past Rupanuga Maharaja reported that you were not sending him regular reports so he could compile his GBC report to me; please cooperate with him in this so our huge organization can run smoothly in all its parts.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
