Nairobi

My dear Brahmananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 2, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Somehow or other I want that the Nairobi center is maintained, not closed. As sannyasi you can come and go, but my only ambition is that the center may not be closed.

You can inform the Mr. Motichand Shah, the gentleman who has started "Krishna Industries," that he can pay at least 50% of his income to the temple. If he wants to serve Krishna and he doesn't spend anything for Krishna, then it is not at all good.

I am writing a letter to Caitya Guru das to issue one letter of explanation and apology to Mr. Amarshi B. Shretta, P.O. Box 53, Kisumu, Kenya, explaining what the reason was for not bringing his car at the time appointed. Also, please find enclosed one letter from Sarva Vit das Brahmacari in the Mombassa Temple. Please advise him in this matter as you best can judge the situation being there.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
