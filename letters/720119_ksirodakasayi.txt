My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 12th January, 1972, and I am very pleased to know that another Hindi BTG will be coming out shortly. Now just continue in this way to produce Hindi magazine regularly, and Krishna will give you all facility to print more and more literatures gradually and increase in every respect.

Regarding distribution of magazines, you write each center and ask them how many copies they want. All collections from books and magazine sales should be sent to the Bombay Book Fund Account No. ISKCON Book Fund,* and if temples can pay for magazines in advance that is better, but they may also pay after receiving the magazines, within 30 days. All necessary expenditures will be paid by check from the Book Fund. For petty expenses, not exceeding Rs. 200/- may be kept with you always and everything should be accounted for with vouchers. No such items should be mentioned as "miscellaneous." Anyone who takes money personally for miscellaneous expenditures must sign a voucher---this is accounting. The plain business is that the press is to be submitted the manuscript, they will print and deliver, and then for distributing our office will take necessary action. The magazines should be sent according to the order of the different centers and they should be responsible for the payment of the bill, and when bills are collected, money should be directly deposited in Book Fund Account.

Rohininandana will return to Delhi by 25th this month or as soon as possible after finishing the Jaipur programme.

I hope this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. One devotee Dharmavira is offering one apartment in his possession in Patel Nagar. Gurudasa is returning soon to occupy the place. I think you can live there and work cooperatively.\\
