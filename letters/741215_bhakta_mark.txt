====== Bhakta Mark ======

Brooklyn

My dear Bhakta Mark,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil, and have noted the contents.

It is very nice that you have met with my disciple, Visnujana Swami and you should try to remain with him and learn as much as possible about this wonderful philosophy of Krsna Consciousness from him.

In regards to your initiation it is necessary that you are recommended by one of my elder disciples, such as Visnujana Swami himself or any one of our temple presidents. If he feels you are ready for initiation he can write me a letter and recommend your initiation to me and then we will see. For now I simply request you to continue with this wonderful Sankirtana program and remain as you say in your letter,, cent per cent engaged in serving Krsna and spreading Krsna Consciousness in every way possible by mind, body and words. You can use all of your talents for spreading Krsna Consciousness. So please work closely with Visnujana Maharaja and whatever he says try to do it. And always chant Hare Krsna.

As far as the seven transcendental meters for singing the names of the Lord, that is not so important for now. Better to try to increase the purity of the chanting first, that is our most important thing.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
