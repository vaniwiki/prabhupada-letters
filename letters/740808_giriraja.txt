My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 7, 1974 hand delivered by Panca Dravida Swami. Regarding the installation ceremony here at Vrindaban, it will be done before next Janmastami, and if the cement can be obtained, it will be done after three months. It is good that you have almost completed the new cement godown and the cowshed. I am very glad that people have offered to donate cows. Regarding your Janmastami program expectation of 10,000 people, it is very good. Thank you very much. I am very much pleased what you are doing. Give the people nice prasadam. This is what is temple---life. Chanting, dancing, prasadam, this is what I want.

Regarding getting the USA money for your Sunday feast program, no that is not required. Local people can contribute. There are many temples that are getting donations from the public. In Bhuleshvar there is one Hanuman temple, and they are getting grains and ghee from the public. If you try, you can also get.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
