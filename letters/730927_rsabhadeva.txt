====== Letter to: Rsabhadeva ======

Laguna Beach

My dear Rsabhadeva dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 8, 1973. Regarding the initiations I am accepting the following devotees as my initiated disciples: Bhayahari das (Glen,) Visvamitra das (Vern,) Sanka Das (Jim,) Sarvani dasi (Sharon,) and Nirupadi Dasi (Judy). Please see that they all strictly follow our rules and regulations and that they chant 16 rounds minimum on the beads Hare Krishna mantra.

Also enclosed is a sacred thread for Diradarsa dasa duly sanctified by me. So you can hold a fire sacrifice amongst the devotees and let him hear the mantra from the tape in the right ear.

I hope this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
