====== Madhusudana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Madhusudana,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter of September 16th, 1969 and the enclosed contribution for the book fund. I am pleased to note that you are going on with your Krishna Consciousness duties with enthusiasm. Now you have a very nice wife, Kancanbala, so my request to both of you is that you work combinedly to push on this Sankirtana Movement of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This will bring perfection to your lives, as more and more you become attached to the Lotus Feet of Krishna. Persons under the grip of Maya are simply mad after sense enjoyment, but our goal is to lose all desire for sense gratification and become simply mad after Krishna. This is the perfection of human life, to have no other desire but to render unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. Now you have very good opportunity for elevating yourselves to this status, and if you go on as you are now doing, rigidly following the rules and regulations which you have heard me speak about, then gradually your life will become more and more sublime.

Here in England there is very good potency for spreading Krishna Consciousness. When I arrived on September 11th, there was a nice reception at the airport, and one article reporting on the event is enclosed herewith. Last Tuesday evening we appeared for 40 minutes on a popular interview show on the BBC television station. This Monday there is to be shown another one hour long documentary program on our activities in England. Perhaps you have heard by now that there are three new centers opened recently; Tokyo, Laguna Beach and Colorado. So Lord Caitanya is being very merciful to many of the boys and girls of the present day Western world by giving them the intelligence to understand the importance of developing Krishna Consciousness.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
