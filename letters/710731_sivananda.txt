====== Letter to: Sivananda ======

Berlin

My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I was so anxious to receive word from you and now I have received your letter post-dated 22nd July, 1971 and after such a long time. Thank you very much.

Your letter of appreciation will be published in this years Vyasa Puja publication. I am so pleased to know that in Berlin everything is going on all right. You will be pleased to know that on 2nd August I will be coming to London. So if possible you can come and see me there and we can talk further.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
