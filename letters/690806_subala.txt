====== Subala ======

My dear Subala,

I beg to thank you very much for your letter of August 2, 1969, and I have noted the contents. I am glad to learn that you are selling __BTG__ increasingly, and it is giving me pleasure increasingly. Now in Boston they have decided to make profit of $1,000 per month by selling __BTGs,__ and similarly you try to do that. Satsvarupa has now purchased a large house on the strength of this profit. So in selling __BTG__ not only are we doing first-class propagation work, but also we are making profit to support the temples and facilitate other activities. You have mentioned that Chris has contributed $500, and you are considering sending this to me. This idea is nice, and you may do it. I am thinking that the press department may immediately be begun now in Boston in the new house, so there is necessity for funds for purchasing printing equipment and the necessary paraphernalia for printing our many books. Any extra money you have you can send to me, and when you require some money, I shall supply it. But try to become rich by selling BTG. There is possibility of making profit of at least $1,000 per month.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
