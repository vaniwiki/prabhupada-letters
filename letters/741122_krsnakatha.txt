====== Letter to: Krsnakatha ======

Toronto

My dear Krsnakatha Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated September 30th, 1974 and have noted the contents. So far I know the paintings are coming out nicely from the press so if you like you can remain with your wife in Montreal. You can also paint like Devahuti does by the instructions of the press managers.

There is no hindrance of your being a householder so far as distributing books are concerned. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu had many householder disciples who would preach Krishna Consciousness. I understand recently in Toronto the entire temple distributed many "Isopanisads" and other books. So you can engage your self in spare time in this book distribution without any hindrance. Side by side you can also paint pictures for Krishna. In this way fully engage yourself in Krishna's service. That is what I want. Nothing else.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
