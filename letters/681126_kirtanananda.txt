====== Letter to: Kirtanananda ======

My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of November 20th and have noted the contents carefully. Also I have seen the newsletter of November 20th regarding the progress of our centers in New Vrindaban and Columbus. Both these centers are progressing nicely and I have no doubt that under your able direction the New Vrindaban will become a most prosperous endeavor in spreading Krishna Consciousness and attracting the attention of many new people. There is no need for discouragement because you are working sincerely and according to Krishna's plan your activities prove to be of great use in propagating our movement.

So far as your life insurance policy is concerned, I do not think that you need sign this over to your father. The father's duty is to maintain the son so there is no necessity of you giving up this money to your father. You are serving the greatest Father and therefore all other fathers are automatically served. This money will be of greater profit if you keep it to further develop New Vrindaban. Regarding the six year old cow, it is too old and I do not advise you to purchase. Please thank Randy for the gift which he has sent along with your letter.

Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
