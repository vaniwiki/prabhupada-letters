My dear Brijratanji,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 17th, 1975 and have noted the contents carefully. I welcome your suggestion. I have advised my assistants to publish one chapter in each issue from the Bhagavat Maha-Purana. This will contain the devanagari script as well as the roman script. I thank you very much for your suggestion.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
