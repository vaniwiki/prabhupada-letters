====== Bhurijana, Jagattarini ======

Dallas

My dear Bhurijana and Jagattarini,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters with enclosed offering and I thank you very much.

I am very glad to hear that you are settling into some steady service. Krishna is sending us so many children and they must be nicely guided and educated so that they can grow up to become first-class Vaisnavas. Go on with your service now and do not be side-tracked and create unnecessary problems. If you simply follow the simple program that I have initiated you will be happy in this life time and in the end you will go back to home, back to Godhead.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

I have received your check.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
