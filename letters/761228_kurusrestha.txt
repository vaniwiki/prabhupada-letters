====== Kurusrestha ======

Denver

My dear Kurusrestha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 12, 1976 and have noted the contents carefully.

I have seen the pictures of the Deity installation you have sent. It appears to be very nicely done. Stick to the principles. All the brahmana devotees appear to be very nice. Do this and be happy. In your country hundreds of temples like this must be opened. Town to town, village to village. I am very pleased. Another temple opened, another book published, that is the success of this Movement. Without book distribution the temple worship standard will also diminish. Therefore both of them should go side by side. I can see in the pictures so many outsiders offering respect with awe and veneration. This Deity worship is very important. As soon as you get sufficient initiated brahmanas try to open another center.

It is good that you have stopped all business ventures. Now, stick to it. Book distribution is sufficient. You should not divert for any other business.

Regarding Bhakta Wayne, yes let him work as you have described. That is real preaching. That will be very good preaching if he meets professors of his standard and they are convinced of our philosophy. That will be a great success.

I am very much pleased, thank you very much. Krsna will bless you.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept as my duly initiated disciples the devotees whose names are as follows: Larry---Lalitananda dasa, Otis---Sridama dasa, Nancy---Nidra devi das, Jody---Jagajjanani dasi, Lisa---Lila devi dasi, Pam---Pandurani dasi.

Now hold a fire sacrifice. Ramesvara Maharaja may chant on their beads (or Satsvarupa Maharaja in his absence). Instruct the new initiates to chant a minimum of 16 rounds daily and to follow the four regulative principles very strictly.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
