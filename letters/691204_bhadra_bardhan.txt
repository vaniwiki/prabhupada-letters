====== Bhadra Bardhan ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bhadra Bardhan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 23, 1969 and have noted the contents. I am pleased to learn that the Columbus center is improving gradually and now you have begun to perform plays for the guests at the Sunday feasts. In one way or another you should always be engaged in Krishna Consciousness. This will protect you from the onslaughts of the material nature. Regarding your question about items being used in Krishna's service becoming spiritual, you should understand it that anything which will remind one of Krishna is spiritual, and anything which will make one forget Krishna is material. Actually, everything is of spiritual nature because everything is coming from the Ultimate Source, Krishna. But when something is offered to the Lord or when it is used in His service, then it resumes its spiritual quality because it will remind one of Krishna. Therefore, even though such object may not have consciousness, it will act as spiritual. It is just like when an iron rod is put into the fire: the rod has not actually become fire, but it will act in just the same way as fire.

Regarding your question about the Brahmajyoti, it is explained in __Bhagavad-gita__ that the impersonal Brahman effulgence is emanating from Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The brahma-jyotir is just like the sunlight, which emanates from the Sun God: Because the sunlight has no personal form, this does not mean that the Sun God has become impersonal. You have seen in pictures of Lord Krishna that there is a nice effulgence coming forth from His body. This effulgence is the Brahmajyoti, and it is pervading throughout the entire spiritual and material manifestation. But above this Brahmajyoti is the Supreme Source of everything, Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I hope this important point is clear to you now.

Please offer my blessings to Jaya Gopala and the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
