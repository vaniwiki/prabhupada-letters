====== Hrsikesananda ======

Kathmandu

My dear Hrsikesananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 23/10/76.

I shall send Aksayananda as soon as possible. Let him survey the situation there. As soon as possible I shall also come.

Worship Saligram Sila nicely, husband and wife. Do not forget to follow strictly the four regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds minimum daily.

My thanks are due to H.H. Sri Kali Baba Maharaja and His Majesty for trying to help our movement there. I am eager to open a nice center in Nepal.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
