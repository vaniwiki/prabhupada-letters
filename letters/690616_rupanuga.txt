====== Rupanuga ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to hear that you are successfully carrying on the Sankirtana Movement, and Krishna is giving you encouragement by mercifully giving some money also. So rest assured that Sankirtana Movement is specifically benedicted by Lord Caitanya for achieving all kinds of success. Stick to the principles seriously and faithfully, and there will be no difficulty. Now you may please send as many nice photographs of your Sankirtana activities as possible to Brahmananda for publication in Back To Godhead. In each issue of Back To Godhead there shall be sufficient pictures of our Sankirtana Movement with descriptions. I have advised to follow this policy rigidly.

I am very glad to hear about Sacisuta's activities. He is very intelligent and serious devotee, but due to his past habits, he is a little flickering. I think if there is any suitable girl, you can negotiate for his marriage, and then he will be fixed-up. He has got various capacities, and he can help our movement very much, but as he is a little restless, try to help him be very serious and get a wife amongst our Krishna Conscious girls. Please convey my thanks to him as he is doing very well in Buffalo. Regarding the draft board, Tamala Krishna is also working on this in Los Angeles, so you can open direct correspondence if there is chance for mutual cooperation.

I am enclosing list of Holy Days for the coming months, and also enclosed is a very nice letter I received recently from Sudama in Hawaii. Please convey my blessings to your wife and child. I shall be very pleased to see you again when you come to visit in New Vrindaban. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
