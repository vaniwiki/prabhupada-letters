====== Letter to: Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 25, 1974 and have note the contents. Yes, it is good that you have understood me about not investing any BBT monies in business. Regarding the Spanish publications, it appears that these versions are shorter in length than the English ones. One thing is that Gurukrpa Swami has written that he will not be able to legally send any more money out of the country after the final payment to Japan, but you have written in your last letter that he would be transferring money into my account.

Regarding my health, I am improving by the grace of Krishna. Thank you very much for taking so much care of my health for praying to Nrsimhadeva. He is very kind. By all your prayers He will surely take care of me. Kindly follow all rules and regulations. That will give you spiritual strength. We should always be in touch with Krishna the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. That is by chanting Hare Krishna.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
