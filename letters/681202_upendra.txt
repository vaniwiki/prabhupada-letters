<card class="letter">
My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of November 30th, 1968 and have noted the contents carefully. I have noted with pleasure that you have spoken before a group of the Catholic Church. You should know that as far as our Krishna Consciousness movement goes, we are better Christians than those who proclaim that they are following the orders of Christ. This is because we are following and generally they are not. Just like the 10 Commandments order that thou should not kill. But these so-called Christians are performing so much killing by meat-eating and wars. So how are they good Christians? You may ask them this in your meetings and try to convince them of their position. Also, we do not commit adultery, we do not take the Name of God in vain, in fact we practice that the Name of God is just as good as God. So according to the 10 Commandments, nobody is Christian, but in our own way we are following the principles of the 10 Commandments strictly. So I think you may explain to them how this Krishna Consciousness movement will help them advance to be better Christians.

I have also noted that you write to say that you are having trouble with sex agitation. Why you do not marry then? Either you become grhastha or what other choice is there? Either you train yourself and pray to Krishna, begging that you may remain brahmacari or else get yourself married.

On the Disappearance Day of my Guru Maharaja, you may hold meeting to discuss His activities and offer respect to His Memory. Practically, this movement is His because it is under His order that I have come to your country.

So continue to chant your full 16 rounds daily, even there is effort and I am sure that you will be helped by Krishna through the difficulties of this inferior energy, maya. I hope this finds you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
