====== Tulsi ======

Los Angeles

My dear Tulsi das:

Please accept my blessings. Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following as my initiated disciples and their names are:

Barbara Stark---Bhrama Karika devi; and Bhakta Ned---Nirguna dasa. I also accept for second initiation Mahaswara dasa. His sacred thread is duly enclosed sanctified by me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
