====== Letter to: Umapati ======

Paris

My dear Umapati,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated 12th July, 1970.

I understand that the new boy, Harivilasa, is very experienced, so if he is going to be president that is nice. We want a good administration---that is one side of our propaganda work.

I am very glad to hear about the apartment of the American boy, Lou, which you are utilizing as a base in Paris. That is nice. Anywhere we may live, our chanting process must go on.

Yes, the police and Government men will gradually understand us and naturally their harassment will diminish. The same thing is happening everywhere. So prepare excellent literatures, that will enhance our prestige.

I am very glad that you have made nice arrangements for carrying on our preaching work and maintaining everyone including the householders without necessity of an outside job. You are all very advanced and experienced, so do it nicely. That will give me pleasure.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
