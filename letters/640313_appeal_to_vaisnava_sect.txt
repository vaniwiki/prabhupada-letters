====== Appeal to Vaisnava Sect ======

__AN APPEAL TO THE VAISNAVA SECT AND SPECIALLY TO THE VALLABHA SAMPRADAYA OF BOMBAY AND GUJARAT.__\\
INSERT SANSKRIT HERE

SRIMAD BHAGAVATAM is very dear to all Vaisnavites and especially to the __Vallabha__ and the __Gaudiya__ Vaisnavas. The glories of Vrindaban and Mathura are magnified by these two Sampradayas and the undersigned as an humble servant of all Vaisnavas, has tried his best to render it into elaborate English version for its publicity all over the world. The first and second volumes of the publication are already out and there are still 58 fifty eight parts to be published to finish this mighty project.

I am therefore appealing to the Vallabha Vaisnavites specifically to help me in this mighty project. I am a Sannyasi and as duty bound I have attempted this heavy task for benefit of all human beings and I am seeking your valued cooperation.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
