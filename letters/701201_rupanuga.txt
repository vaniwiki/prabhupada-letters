====== Letter to: Rupanuga ======

Buffalo

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12th November, 1970 and have noted the contents carefully.

That the sannyasis have gone is all right. Also Gargamuni Maharaja is trying for Florida. That is good. I've written to him one letter encouraging him. I think things are going nicely. So please cooperate with the sannyasis. Work with them so that they may go on with their missionary activities.

I've advised all the GBC members here to keep regular correspondence with you. So what is the cause for mistrust? I do not know.

These engagements at schools and colleges is a most important task. If schools become interested with our philosophy and we can introduce these books, then it is our success. A little effort in this direction is sure to be successful because these are completely new thoughts for the Western world, this science of God. And because the West is scientific minded, they will take it up. We should try for this vigorously. Once they take up Krishna Consciousness in the colleges, it will be the greatest success. We've got books and we've got the Dr. Staal correspondence. Let the school authorities inquire about it. These are the propoganda items. This task should especially be entrusted to Hayagriva Prabhu because he is in one university. Not just Hayagriva, but all of you who are college graduates. You know better than me how to introduce these books into the schools. Also recently I have received one report from Jagadisa and he is distributing our books nicely.

Yes, all blessings for this marriage between Nityananda das and Carol. Please also offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
