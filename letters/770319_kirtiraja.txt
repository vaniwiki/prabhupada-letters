My dear Kirtiraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 8th March, 1977. It is very encouraging.

I am very grateful to the boy and girl who are distributing our books in Poland. Gradually, it will be alright if they are initiated. In their case some special concession may be made to encourage them, even they cannot follow so strictly. Let them continue still a little longer before initiation.

The program of preaching aboard the Russian ships is very nice. You are very intelligent. As to which way to preach aboard the ship, do you think best.

The best thing will be if you and your family stay in Poland over a long period of time so that you can train the interested persons. At the same time others may come and go visiting for book distribution. You should try to get residency and if you can get property there that is very nice. That is our main business, that by our association we should try to train people up in our philosophy and principles. Yes, I approve your idea to have a sankirtana party in America to support the Polish preaching. You have got good intelligence so utilize it properly and Krishna will help you.

The idea to send Bhagavad-gita to influence people and world leaders as complimentary copy is good, and the cover letter as you suggest is also O.K. The BBT may pay for it.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
