====== Letter to: Sumati Morarjee ======

Madam Sumati Morarjee Baisaheba,

Please accept my greetings. I hope you are doing well. Since a long time I have not heard from you. I hope this letter will find you in good health and devotional service of Lord Krishna. I hope you are getting my "Back to Godhead" paper regularly, and you will be glad to know that the paper has increased in circulation by this time and we are printing 50,000 copies per month.

Also you will be pleased to know that now I have got 24 branches---perhaps you have seen the list in our "Back to Godhead." Our Indian Vaisnavas are helping me by contributing each one pair or more Radha Krishna Murtis for our different Temples. I would request you also to contribute one pair of Radha Krishna Murti and recommend some of your friends to do the same.

You will find in the enclosed copy of the letter that Dalmia-Jayan Trust has contributed one pair of Murti, and similarly the Birla Trust has contributed four pairs of Murtis. Now I request you to carry these Murtis to America by your shipping line. The Murtis are being prepared in Vrindaban, under the direction of Sri H.S. Sharma, Secretary to Dalmia Jayan Trust. The Murtis are already packed and ready for dispatch, so on hearing from you, immediately they will be sent to your care for being carried by your shipping lines to the respective destinations; namely Boston, Montreal, New York and Los Angeles. So kindly send your instructions to the following address: H. S. Sharma, Dalmia Charitable Trust, 4 Scindia House, New Delhi.

Awaiting your early reply and thanking you in anticipation.

Yours in the service of the Lord,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
