====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 28, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. The circular you have sent to the presidents and members of ISKCON is very nicely drawn, and please follow the principles. All students should be encouraged to write some article after reading Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and Teachings of Lord Caitanya. They should realize the information, and they must present their assimilation in their own words. Otherwise, how they can become preachers? So far as Sankirtana Party is concerned, as many pictures as possible should be published each month. The pictures are very attractive to the customers also. Acyutananda should also be asked to send pictures, as many as possible, of the many Visnu temples in India for publication in BTG. BTG should be full with our own articles, and there is no need for articles by outsiders. So far as ads are concerned, only our own books should be advertised; nothing else.

Your proposal to keep my apartment by arrangement with Mr. Chudy by the residence of Vaikunthanatha there is very nice. If this is done, I shall be pleased. So far as my goods are concerned, they must be packed in trunks with inventory taken of where each item is being kept. For the time being, you may send me immediately from my book-shelf #6 (SB, Cantos 4, 5, and 6---a red book), #48 (Websters Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary), and the black bound typewritten manuscripts of __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ and __Caitanya-caritamrta.__ I hope by now you have received the key from Purusottama, which I think is for the closet door. There are some important files in the closet. One of them is for the Radha-Damodara temple. That file contains many important documents. That should be kept very carefully. Immediately I don't require it, but I shall send for it when it is needed. When Gargamuni comes, or if Rayarama is coming, then the tape recorder, as well as the suitcase with my clothings may be sent.

Now the $600 which we have saved from the ISKCON PRESS establishment may be invested in improving our New Vrindaban scheme. I am writing to Hayagriva to transfer the property in the society's name, and I have already talked with him. So far as my books are concerned, work with great enthusiasm to print, sell, and bind them in cooperation with the other boys. I am glad that Gargamuni is coming here to improve his business in cooperation with Tamala Krishna. This is nice, and I have full approval. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
