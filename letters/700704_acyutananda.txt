Calcutta

My dear Acyutananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21st June, 1970, as well as the telegram conveying the news of Jayapataka's arrival. I am also enclosing a letter for him in reply to his letter from Brussels.

I hope by this time you have occupied the apartment and now conjointly you can work nicer. Jayapataka is a very sincere devotee and intelligent also. Both of you combined together can do some real service to the cause of Lord Krsna and Lord Caitanya.

Regarding the land, many hindrances are coming one after another but still I say that you purchase the land of Jabed Ali. We shall take the risk because the proprietorship of Jabed Ali is clear, so there is not risk of purchasing the land. The next risk is that they will not allow us to construct building. The land in that part of the country is agricultural certainly and Sridhara Maharaja or Yayabar Maharaja have got land in that vicinity however. Sridhara Maharaja's land is not very big plot. So I will be glad to know what is the measurement of the land and what is the price. If Sridhara Maharaja and others' lands are on the agricultural plot and they are permitted to construct building why we shall be refused for doing so? I think you shall purchase the land of Jabed Ali Sekh and at the same time apply for permission. That will be nice. Please immediately let me know if you have removed to the Ballygunge apartment as informed to me previously---this is essential.

You are preaching in Calcutta in educated circles, that is alright, but there is no use of your going to the interior villages. My principle is that where my other Godbrothers cannot preach I shall go there. On my behalf you should follow this principle, also. Srila Prabhupada Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami Maharaja did not very much like preaching amongst women, so you should also avoid such meetings. Now Jayapataka and yourself combined together shall preach in English this Krsna consciousness philosophy amongst the educated circle and perform Kirtana.

So first of all let me know if you have changed your address, then I shall let you know the program of work and if required I shall send some more American and English boys. As soon as we get our own place many Indian boys from other camps will join us. So immediately let me know if you have removed to your new address.

Awaiting your early reply. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. What about my place at Radha Damodara Temple. My money is already advanced to them. Please let me know where is the key? Sometimes you may go there and live for a few days. On hearing from you, I shall send you the copy of the advanced money receipt both by the %%___%%.

Reply this letter to L.A. address 3764 Watseka Avenue L.A.\\
