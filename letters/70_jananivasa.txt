====== Jananivasa ======

My dear Jananivasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 23rd November as well as the encouraging newspaper article enclosed. Please forgive this late replay, but due to my traveling much of my mail has been neglected.

Presently I am touring many cities in India and the response here has been very good. Actually everyone in India is a devotee; they have simply been misled by politicians and so many things. By Lord Chaitanya's mercy we are again reviving their original Krishna Consciousness, just as we are doing in all our centers all over the world.

I am very glad to learn that your college program is doing so nicely there. Please continue in this way and also introduce our books into the classes and libraries. We want to reach the intelligent class of men and so this college program is of first rate importance. In your country they are very scientifically minded and so if Krishna Consciousness is presented to them nicely, surely they will take to this, the greatest of sciences. You can approach the professors in that way and try to arrange for accredited classes in Krishna Consciousness also.

So far as getting yourself married is concerned, I have no objection. Be sure that you can meet the obligations of Grihasta order of life and then when you find a nice girl you may marry with my blessings.

Thank you for your invitation to Columbus temple and I will be very glad to visit there when I return to the U.S. I will be going to New Vrindaban, so perhaps from there I can visit Columbus.

Please offer my blessings to the other good devotees there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
