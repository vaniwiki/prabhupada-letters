====== Letter to: Cyavana ======

Nairobi

My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter and I am pleased about all the news. It sounds that you are doing well, and I'm so pleased to learn that Damji Devji, as well as Mr. Shah, they are helping you so much. So I am very much obliged to them. Please offer my sincere thanks to them. It will be a great pleasure for me to meet them again when I return to Nairobi.

As you are so quickly managing the affairs of East African campaign, I am sure you have all blessings of Lord Krishna, so continue to work very hard for His pleasure and all of you will go back to Home, back to Godhead.

Your Trial Balance is very good, and it should be an example to all the other centers. I am sending a copy of it to all the other centers.

I shall be leaving here (Bombay) on 23rd instant, but we shall cable flight details later. If there is satisfactory program there, if you are getting that new place, then I may stay for some time in Africa as there is not much hope for Mayapur program here due to government ban on foreigners in Nadia District.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
