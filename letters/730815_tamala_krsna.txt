My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th August 1973. I am sending you the copy of a letter sent to Mahamsa that was sent to you in reply to your letter of 2nd August which should explain everything clearly.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB. Mr Pulla Reddy gave us the land as a donation and why he is making now this land as a trust property, why not outright gift land? These are very important points. I have not heard anything from you about Mayapur and Bombay affair. If Mrs. Nair is not definite of selling to us, then what is the purpose of transferring the required money to India. I can transfer the money immediately on hearing from you. I have already written you one letter from Paris.
