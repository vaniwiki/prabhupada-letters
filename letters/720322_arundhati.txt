====== Arundhati ======

Miami

My dear Arundhati dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 1, 1972, wherein you state that you have returned to your rightful position of serving Krishna in the Miami center, and that you are very much repentiful and wish to return to your husband. That is very good news to me, as I am always glad to see when my disciples exhibit good sense. Yes, you have understood rightly that one can never really be satisfied apart from Krishna, so I think that now if you simply stick very closely to the regulative principles and always keep yourself and your child 24 hours engaged in devotional service, so much so, that you will be too much busy serving Krishna to think about other things. In this way, your mind can become steady.

Now I have taken your husband with me, and he shall always remain with me from now on to learn perfectly sanskrit language exactly as it is understood by our line of acaryas from Krishna Himself. We shall be leaving India in a few days time, and after visiting our centers in the Far East we shall be returning to Los Angeles, so I do not think it will be practical for you to join your husband just now, but perhaps later we shall see.

Hoping this will meet you and your son in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
