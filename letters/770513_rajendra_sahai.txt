My dear Sri Sahaiji, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter, undated.

Regarding Sri Beni Madho Temple, I have already advised Sri Acarya Omkar Giri to see my friend Dr. G. Ghosh of Allahabad, for making a Deed of Gift. But I have not heard anything further in the negotiation. Perhaps you can let me know what has transpired in this regard.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
