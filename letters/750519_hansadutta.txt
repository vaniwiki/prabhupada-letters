My dear Hansadutta dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 15th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your pair of slippers is very nice. Thank you very much. Thank you for sending my coat to Melbourne. It is a little cool here. Your program in Germany is a good one. There is no need of establishing a deity for the time being in these places you have mentioned. Simply make a nice preaching center. Yes, while you are in India you may appoint other competent devotees to take responsibilities. I am very pleased with the life member program as well as the annadan program. That is a very good idea.

Regarding BBT affairs, European publications are your main business, but for the time being, you must also see to the accounts and managing of the BBT in USA. Bhagavan can also be another BBT trustee. His name can be added to the list. It is approved by me that you get the books for only 20% above the cost of printing.

Regarding the farm, whatever money I had, they have taken 3 1/2 lakhs in India. Giriraja tooks 2 lakhs and Jayapataka Swami took 1 1/2 lakhs. So, you can provide the funds from Europe I think. As far as machines are concerned, it is better to avoid using them as far as possible. I am enclosing one letter that I have recently written to Mahamsa Swami concerning the farm for your information.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
