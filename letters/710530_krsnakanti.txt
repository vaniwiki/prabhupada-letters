====== Krsnakanti ======

Seattle

My dear Krsnakanti,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th May, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. You will be glad to know that the two boys, Paul and Patrick, recommended by you have been duly initiated by me and their beads and letters are enclosed herewith. Their names are purusa and Bhumna respectively.

So far as your coming here to India, one thing to consider is that temple worship must go on nicely. That cannot suffer and if it is dependent on you, then you shouldn't come. For India, anyone can come; a newly initiated neophyte is all right. Experienced men like yourself are not required. So instead of you, find a newcomer; he can come.

One thing though, is that I have noted with interest that you are proficient in the Russian language. If that is the case, then your service may be very much required, and so if I go to Russia at all in the near future, then I shall call for you and you shall accompany me to Moscow.

For the time being, develop our Seattle center more and more and make it a grand success. That will be to your credit and Krishna will be pleased. So do it nicely. Two new boys have come just recently and as Krishna sees that you are sincere to push on this movement, so he will send you many more devotees.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
