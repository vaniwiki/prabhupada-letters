====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 30, 1975 and have noted the contents. I don't think that Hayagriva is at fault. He has not changed the meaning or the philosophy in any way. But if you like to use the original manuscript, then if it is possible, you can use it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
