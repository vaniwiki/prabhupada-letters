Bombay

My dear Tamala Krsna Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. This is to introduce you to Hari Goswami of the Radha Raman Mandir in Vrindaban. He is coming to Bombay and will meet you, so please receive him nicely. Later when our buildings are completed, he will join our movement and live with us.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Please give him one copy of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
