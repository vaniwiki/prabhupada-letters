Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 5, 1976 which was delivered to me by Ramesvara. Hrdayananda Maharaja has suggested that why don't you come to South America and assist him in responsible management. That is good idea. Please keep me informed of your activities.

I hope that this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
