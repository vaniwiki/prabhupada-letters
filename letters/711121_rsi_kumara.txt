====== Rsi Kumara ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Rsi Kumar,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt or your letter dated 17-11-71. Your desire not to come to Delhi at the present moment is very much appreciated by me. So far our service is concerned it is not limited to any particular place, but when it is required to be fixed up in a place for a certain reason, it is better to stick without any change of mind. I think your presence in Bombay is needed.

So far the house as suggested by you if I have not seen it, then you can negotiate and when I return to Bombay and see it personally then we can finalize the negotiations.

When your Bombay program is fixed up, please let me know. I have not received any information as yet for the Madras program. If the Madras program is not yet fixed up, please let me know when we can accept other programs because we have many invitations from different parts of India.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
