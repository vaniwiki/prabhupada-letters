Paris

Dear Bhagavan dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 19, 1973 and I have carefully considered the contents.

You have done a nice job with the French edition of Back to Godhead, and I am especially looking forward to the next issue which will be color 32 pages. You should more and more improve this magazine until it becomes superior to all other magazines in the French language. The translating of our books such as Bhagavad-gita and Isopanisad is of the utmost importance and I am very thankful that you are seriously taking on this practical work for spreading Krsna Consciousness in your European zone.

The best date for the installation of Deities will be August 10th, Friday. So we shall probably arrive in Paris on the 9th of August and stay until August 15th when we shall return to London. You can arrange for meetings with respectable gentlemen of France, to take place in my quarters while I am there. You can immediately send open plane tickets for myself, Srutakirti, Hansadutta and Pradyumna (Vincent Florentino, Hans Kary and Paul Sherbow).

Enclosed are the gayatri mantras for the devotees recommended by you and one thread for the boy, Kapila das. Have the brahmanas hear the tape of my speaking the gayatri mantra in the right ear, and instruct them in the principles of __suci.__

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
