Dear Shri Chavan:

Kindly accept my greetings and extend the same to your good wife. I am so much obliged to you that you have lauded our activities throughout the world. This Krishna consciousness movement is based on deep science of the laws of nature. This human life is a boon to the conditioned soul to understand this science. I do not wish to take much of your valuable time but I would have been very much pleased that persons like you without any political prejudice come and take up this movement seriously and benefit the whole human society with this knowledge.

At least in India where this knowledge was generated there must be some institution to know it perfectly and distribute it throughout the world. That will glorify India’s prestige. To broadcast India’s glorification is the duty of every Indian without any political differences. I wish that you may take some active part in this movement and thus magnify the prestigious position of India.

Thank you very much for coming the other day and speaking so nicely about this Krishna consciousness movement.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
