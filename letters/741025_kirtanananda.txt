<card class="letter">
New Vrindaban

My dear Kirtanananda Swami:

Please accept my blessings. In India ghee is needed in our temples. I want to know if you can supply ghee by exporting it from USA. The quantity is 100 lbs. for Mayapur and 100 lbs. for Vrindaban per month. I am prepared to pay you for it in dollars at the fair market price.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
