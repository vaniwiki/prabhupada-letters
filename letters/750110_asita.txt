My dear Asita das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. If you want to stay there I have no objection. For the time being you can perform your devotional service in Puri and when I return to Mayapur in mid-March, you can see me and we shall see what was the cause for your being asked to leave. It is a big establishment and sometimes disagreement happens and I am helpless. I am enquiring from Mayapur why you were asked to leave there. If you want to take initiation from madhava Gosvami Maharaja I have no objection.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
