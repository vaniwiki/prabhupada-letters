====== Sripati ======

Montreal

My dear Sripati dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1974 with enclosed Deed of Sale. I am very glad that you have gotten this house. Now make it very nice for Krishna. It should be so attractive that people will want to go there and take advantage of this Krishna consciousness movement. Do not make it simply for comfortable living. Yes, if you distribute my books side by side than that is a very good arrangement, and your temple will be glorious in the city of Montreal. I will want to go there and visit you when I next come to the USA, so I will look forward to that.

Since it is our own house, you can install large Deities. You can install big Deities like Chicago temple. Invite Kirtanananda Maharaja and Jagadisa Prabhu and have a nice ceremony.

Upon your recommendation I am accepting for brahminical initiation Ghosa Thakura dasa, Priya Bandhu dasa, Priya Bhakta dasa, Bhadra Priya dasi, Sadhvi dasi, and Mohini dasi. Enclosed are the sanctififed threads. I also accept for first initiation the following devotees and their names are: Paul Campbell---Puskaraksa dasa; Christian Thomas---Krtakrta dasa; Leona Bolivar---Lalita devi dasi; Marie Cadeau---Medhya devi dasi. Now hold a fire sacrifice and the gayatri mantra should be listened from my tape recording through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
