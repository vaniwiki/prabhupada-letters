My dear Malati,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter of December 17, 1968, I am always so glad to be hearing from you. Your sincere attitudes expressed are very nice and I thank you for them. I am very pleased that you are serving your husband nicely and helping him so that he may advance his Krishna Consciousness. When the husband advances, automatically the wife shares in his success so there is all around benefit. So a good wife is a great boon to her husband and to her children so please continue in this way and I know that your life will be very successful. Kindly convey my blessings to Syamasundara and Sarasvati Devi. I hope that you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: So far as the new chant that you heard being sung at arti, there is no objection.
