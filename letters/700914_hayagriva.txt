====== Hayagriva ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 31st, 1970, and noted the contents.

I am very glad to know that the GBC is actively working to rectify the subversive situation which has been weakening the very foundation of our Society. All you members of the GBC please always remain very vigilant in this connection so that our society's growth may go on unimpeded by such poisonous elements. Your preaching in New Vrndavana as well as intensified study of our literatures with seriousness is very much encouraging. Please continue this program with vigor and reestablish the solidity of our movement.

From the very beginning I was strongly against the impersonalists and all my books are stressed on this point. So my oral instruction as well as my books are all at your service. Now you GBC consult them and get clear and strong idea, then there will be no disturbance. Disturbance is caused by ignorance; where there is no ignorance, there is no disturbance. The four Sannyasis may bark, but still the caravan will pass. There is every evidence that they are influenced by some of my fourth-class Godbrothers.

Regarding India, first of all I am trying to fix up a center in Calcutta and then I shall call you as your presence is needed. In the meantime go on constructing New Vrndavana.

If there is opportunity, try to convince these rascal Sannyasis who are misled by fourth-class men that if they at all want to have a change of leadership why do they not select a better leader than at present moment. What is the use of finding out a fourth-class leader who has no asset as their background. I am simply sorry that such intelligent boys are misusing their brain-substance in this way. Try to rectify them as far as possible. Isana Das has inquired from Tamala regarding Tirtha Maharaja. I do not know what is the sequence of this inquiry, but it is clear that there is a great clique and the so-called Sannyasis are the via media of spreading contamination in our Society. It is a very sorry plight.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
