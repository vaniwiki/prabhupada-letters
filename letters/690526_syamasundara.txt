====== Syamasundara ======

My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I am very pleased to read your letter dated May 21, 1969. Your anxiety for my health may not be increased, because I am keeping quite fit nowadays. There was a little backache in Boston for two or three days, but now I am walking in this hilly tract up and down. So don't be anxious. There about 16 centers now, so we have to take care of at least 16 centers daily. Otherwise, how these branches can be conducted? But gradually I am trying to divide the responsibility to departmental heads. I am so glad that you are trying so strenuously for success of our London Yatra program. I am sure our London program will be very successful because you are all sincere workers. In our Krishna Consciousness Movement, anyone who has got full blessings and confidence of the Spiritual Master, and therefore Krishna, his success is sure. In the __Caitanya Caritamrta__ it is said "__guru krsna krpaya paya bhakti lata bija__ [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|(Cc. Madhya 19.151)]]."

I am so glad to note that you are tackling very consistently a great personality like George Harrison, and he is becoming gradually inclined to our movement. I am very satisfied to learn that he has recently made one record along with you of Hare Krishna. If possible, send me one tape recording of it so I shall play it here.

Regarding Rathayatra, this must be done at any cost. I may go or not go; that is not important. But Rathayatra Festival, as you have already made program, somehow or other it must be done. A grand program is being made in San Francisco, organized by Tamala Krishna, and with the full cooperation of all Western Coast centers. They are inviting public from all the neighboring places, and they expect a big assembly of people. If I do not go to London to take part in the Rathayatra Festival there, then I shall go to San Francisco to take part in that Festival. But if you want me to go there and invite me, then I am prepared for that also. Mataji Syamadevi has invited me to go to London and she says that she has fulfilled my desire by starting an asrama in Leicester and the Deity has arrived. She stresses that I must go there and wants me to inform her when I shall be able to go. So you can let her know that I am expecting to go to London by the middle of July.

Please convey my blessings to Malati and the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am starting a formal school here in N.V. and your daughter grows, she can be sent here. ACB
