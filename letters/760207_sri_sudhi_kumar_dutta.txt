Sri Sudhi Kumar Dutta\\
Calcutta

My dear Sudhi,

Please accept my blessings. When I met with you last in Calcutta I wanted to know whether or not you could organize the sales of our books. If you are interested in this connection, I can help you up to the extent of Rs. 500 per month. Please let me know your decision if you are able to do this business.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
