====== Harer Nama ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Harer Nama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 13, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I am so glad to hear that you are having nice response now and soon you hope to hold some feasts. If by the summer you feel that the center has urgent necessity of some other brahmacaris, then we shall arrange for this. At present I think that Tosana may go to North Carolina immediately and help Bhurijana with the center there. In the meantime, you try to keep the temple maintained somehow or other, so when the summer arrives some helper may go to give you assistance.

Please let me know if Kamalasana arrives there in Sante Fe. He has left the temple here all of a sudden, and no one knows where he is. I am very much anxious for him, so please let me know if you have any word from him.

Thanking you again for your letter. I hope that this will be meeting you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. In case of urgent work somebody may go to help you from here. ACB.
