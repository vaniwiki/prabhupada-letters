====== Letter to: Vedavyasa ======

Taunus, West Germany

My dear Vedavyasa das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 8, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your going to Los Angeles, if Dr. Wolf suggests that you come, you should do it. At least you can come as tourist, so there should be no difficulty. So you should consult with Dr. Wolf.

Regarding your questions, you may not be so advanced that you will take the karmi remnants as prasada. The karmis should not be given so much that there is waste. You can give them a little, and then if they like you can give them more. This system should be introduced everywhere. I have seen myself that so much prasada is being left. This is not good. Regarding the attitude for taking prasada, if you think it is something palatable, so let me take more and more, then that is sense gratification. But, still it is prasadam so it will act. Prasad is transcendental, but one should not take too much. Sannyasis may take the maha-prasada but not to overeat. Caitanya Mahaprabhu was taking, but on principle he was avoiding.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
