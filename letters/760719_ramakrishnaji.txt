Bombay

My dear Sriman Ramakrishnaji,

Please accept my greetings. Enclosed please find newsclippings of our Rathayatra Festival held on 5th. Avenue, New York last Sunday. They are taking it seriously now, "East meets West. . ." This is the real platform of United Nations, spiritual understanding. I wish that the coordinator of the Gita Pratisthan will preach the gospel of the Gita on this understanding.

Tomorrow I am going on to London. I hope to return to Bombay on or about August 14th. Hoping that this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
