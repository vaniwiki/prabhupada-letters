My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10th January, 1971 and have noted the contents. Also I've received the very nice article enclosed and it has been appreciated by our Indian friends here also. And thank you very much for sending regular maintenance fund checks, via L.A.

I am so glad to note that your Sankirtana program is improving and that you are preaching directly from Bhagavad-gita As It Is. Sravanam Kirtanam. this is the process. It is beneficial for the recitor as well as the hearer. Also, book distribution is a very important program and you should give much attention to developing it. If anyone simply reads our KRSNA book, TLC, NOD, Bhagavad-gita As It Is, he is sure to become a Krishna Conscious person. So somehow or other, either through the schools or colleges, libraries, life membership program or ordinary sales, we must push on this literature distribution program. It is so important and a most valuable service to Krishna.

So far as leaving your karmi job, I have no objection provided there is no scarcity of money for running the temple. Then you can devote yourself full time to pushing on this movement and developing St. Louis center. So you have my permission provided there is no financial difficulty.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
