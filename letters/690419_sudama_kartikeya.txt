====== Sudama, Kartikeya ======

My dear Sudama and Kartikeya,

Please accept my blessings to the both of you. I was very much anxious to receive your letters, so now I am pleased to acknowledge receipt of them. I can understand that things are improving all around, and that is very satisfactory. So depend upon Krishna, work very sincerely, and everything will be complete without any doubt. On the kirtana nights you should all assemble together in the temple and if this is not possible then you can chant in your apartment. I am pleased that you are working for our activities in Japan, and in three months you should be able to gather at least $1,500.00 together. Don't spend money needlessly. Try to save as much as possible, because you have very important work to do for the service of Lord Caitanya.

Regarding Kartikeya's question about worshiping Lord Jagannatha, He should always be worshiped with awe and reverence. Krishna's picture as a Naughty Child should not be treated by us as a naughty child. We should always worship Krishna as the Supreme Lord.

I hope this will meet you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
