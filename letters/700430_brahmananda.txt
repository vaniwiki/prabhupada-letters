My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th April, 1970.

Regarding printing KRSNA book in Japan because the printing details are difficult here in this country, that was my former decision. In the beginning I decided like that.

Regarding NOD, I am sending herewith the dedication as desired by you.

The program of hardbound books to be printed in Japan, and softbound printed on our own press is a nice suggestion. So far printing is concerned, I have just received the French BTG, and it is very nicely done, so convey my thanks to Uddhava and Advaita especially. In this way if we can print on our own press, it will be very nice.

Regarding travelling, a Sannyasi's name is Parivrajakacarya, that is the beginning of Sannyasa. In the beginning one is ordered not to stay more than three days at a place, but at the Paramahamsa stage, one can stop moving, but that is not compulsory. So I have made my headquarters at L.A., that is a fact, still I may go in an emergency outside (not ordinarily) for a few days, and then come back to my headquarters.

There is a gap of some transcriptions---tapes numbers 12 through 16, KRSNA, so please get them done. I shall be slow in making further tapes till I get them back. Please give this instruction to the editors.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
