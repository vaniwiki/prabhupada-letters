====== Tusta Krsna ======

My dear Tusta Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 12, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, Karandhara said that Sriman Siddha Svarupa Ananda is not up to the point of our preaching work, especially when the "Sai Speaks" booklet was distributed there was some discrepancy from our standard. So when this complaint was lodged I called him here and I asked him to stay with me for some time. When I went to London I made arrangement that Siddha Svarupa Ananda Maharaja would speak in the sanctuary of Los Angeles Temple and this was settled up and he remained here in Los Angeles when I went to London. After coming back I understood that he left immediately when I left for London. I have received no letter from him. So there is no misunderstanding, but I want to keep him with me for some time, so if you have got his address you can ask him to come to me and live with me again for some time. It is better not to draw any wrong conclusions from so little evidence, actually he is very sincere soul and everyone knows it and I like him very much and so does Karandhara, so you need not worry in this connection.

I am very glad to understand that all of the programs there in Auckland are going on very nicely. If you have got opportunity to travel and hold kirtana with your music group over the South Pacific, why not take advantage? I shall be very pleased to see the new album "Cause of All Causes". And upon your recommendation I am very glad to accept the three boys as my duly initiated disciples. Their letter is enclosed.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
