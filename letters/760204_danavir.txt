====== Letter to: Danavir ======

Los Angeles

My dear Danavir,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your news letter of January 22, 1976 and I thank you very much. Your sincere endeavor to engage new devotees is very much appreciated. It is especially encouraging that these new devotees are taking on responsible service within our communities. They should follow our regulative principles, chant Hare Krsna and engage all day in the service of Lord Krsna. That is the only way that they will become satisfied.

Please continue with your service. Encourage everyone to take up this Krsna conscious life and set a high standard by your own good example.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
