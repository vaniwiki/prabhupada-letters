====== Dinanatha ======

Calcutta

My dear Dinanath,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 14, 1975 and I thank you very much for the same. I am so much pleased that your staying in my Vrindaban temple was not any inconvenience.

I met a very major car accident in Mauritius, and still there is some little sore on my knees. So by the middle of December I shall go back to Vrindaban via Delhi. From there I shall go to South India to Nellore, and then I shall go to Calcutta by the beginning of February, 1976. Surely at that time we shall meet.

By the by we had some talks when you were in Vrindaban about some flat apartment. I require a flat of four rooms. If you kindly negotiate and let me know the terms, it will be very kind of you. The flats can be taken either on rent or maybe purchased.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
