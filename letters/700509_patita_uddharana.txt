====== Patita Uddharana ======

Boston

My dear Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24th April, 1970, along with the typical examples of hardbound editions of Sri Isopanisad, and thank you so much for them.

This binding work is so nicely made. You have done it very well, and I am completely satisfied. I very much appreciate your efforts in our ISKCON bindery, and if such binding is done we will have sure success with our books.

So you can bind our books in this way, and although it may go slowly just now it is being done very nicely. Then in future you may be able to do our binding here instead of in Japan. You write to say that these are some nice typical examples of your binding work, so it is a great credit because these books any man would be proud to have. I beg to thank you once again for your kind appreciations and excellent work.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
