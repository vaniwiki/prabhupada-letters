====== Gangamayi ======

London

My dear Gangamayi devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 21, 1974 and have noted the contents. There have been many letters coming from different quarters regarding the election; therefore I have called for a re-election in the presence of all members and two GBC men. You can have a written ballot, and whoever receives the majority vote, he shall be the president.

You are right that politics should be avoided. In my personal life I did not participate in the political diplomacy of my god-brothers. I was simply thinking how to fulfill the order of my guru maharaj. He gave me his blessings, and I was saved from any implication. Now I am trying to carry out his instructions strictly, and it has come out successful.

I note that you are planning to come to India, and I have no objection. We will be needing experienced pujaris for our Vrindaban temple.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
