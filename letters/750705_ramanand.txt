====== Letter to: Ramanand ======

Gorakpur

My dear Ramanand das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 5, 1975 forwarded to me from Vrindaban. When I return to India I shall go to Gorakpur and talk with you in detail.

I understand that Gopala Krishna Prabhu is soon to be going to visit you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
