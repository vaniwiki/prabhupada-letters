My Dear Bibhavati, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 10, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the painting you planned to give to the New York temple, you should consult with Brahmananda to see if this new arrangement is satisfactory. So you should work this out amongst yourselves. In the meantime, you should practice your painting as you are able, because the picture which you sent me in Boston could still require some more improvement before it is perfect. So practice and this will enhance your talents. Regarding your desire to purchase plates for your small Deities, this is all right, and also the decorated box which you have designed for them sounds very attractive, so you may do it. I have not as yet received back from Janardan the constitution notes which I had given him to read, so please remind him to send them to me as soon as possible.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

p.s. Offer my blessings to all there.
