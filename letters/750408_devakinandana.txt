====== Devakinandana ======

My dear Devakinandana dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have heard that you are a very good man with cows. Your service would be very valuable here in India. I think that you could travel to the centers here where we keep cows and try to establish a very high cow-protection standard. Our cow-protection program in India should be the exemplary standard for the whole world. So, if you like, come to India as soon as possible. You may come directly to Calcutta and from there you can easily go to Sri Mayapur-candra-daya Mandira. I want to improve our Gosala here in Mayapur first.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
