====== Letter to: GBC Secretaries ======

My dear GBC Secretaries,

Please accept my blessings. I have received messages that Mahamsa Swami requires 2 more lacs to complete the Hyderabad construction by Janmastami, 1976. Already I have given about 5 lacs of Rupees, and I believe that Hansadutta Maharaja hs also given a sum of money towards Hyderabad construction. So the total amount of the Hyderabad construction was estimated at about 10 lacs, and if I give this 2 lacs then I have given 7 lacs towards the construction so what is the collection in Hyderabad? It is not good that they are always asking me for money. The money is coming from the BBT in Bombay and it will have to be paid back in due course of time.

So I am sending advice to Bank of America to transfer 2 lacs of Rupees to the Bombay construction account at the State Bank of Hyderabad, Juhu Beach Branch, Bombay, and I want that the 3 GBC secretaries for India should discuss together whether or not to give this 2 lacs to Hyderabad centre for completing their construction. If you think that Mahamsa Maharaja will be able to repay the BBT this money then you can go ahead and give the money to Hyderabad. Otherwise, there is no rush to open the Hyderabad temple by Janmastami, 1976, it can be postponed until a later date when the Hyderabad temple can be completed by collections in South India. So if you are confident that he will pay back the BBT then it is alright, otherwise you can use the 2 lacs for Bombay construction and the Hyderabad temple can be finished with local collections.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
