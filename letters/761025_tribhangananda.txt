====== Tribhangananda ======

My dear Tribhangananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 3/10/76.

Thank you very much for your report of the temple activities there. Please offer my thanks to Mr. Pankhania for his kind assistance to our movement.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. please be sure that everyone there is following strictly the four regulative principles and chanting a minimum 16 rounds daily.\\
