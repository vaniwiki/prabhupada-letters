My dear Ramesvara Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 9/12/74 and have noted the contents. I have already told you to go on with your business of distributing my books. There is no need of transferring the BBT accounts to New York now. Let it go on as it is.

Regarding Bali Mardan, there are so many charges and counter charges. We have appointed an enquiry committee, and let it be finished and we shall do the needful. I have also written to Karandhara, and you can read the letter so that everything may be cleared.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
