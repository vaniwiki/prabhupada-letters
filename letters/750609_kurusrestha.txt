====== Kurusrestha ======

Denver

My dear Kurusrestha dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 5, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am very very pleased with your report about how things are going there. This is very encouraging news. Yes, I will come there. I am leaving Honolulu for L.A. on the 20th of June, and on the 27th of June, I shall come to Denver for 6 or 7 days stay on my way to Chicago temple. Make sure all of the devotees there are working very sincerely, following all of the rules and regulations, chanting 16 rounds, and reading every day, and everything will be successful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
