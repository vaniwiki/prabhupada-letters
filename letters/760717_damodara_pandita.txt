====== Damodara Pandita ======

New Vrindaban

My dear Damodara Pandita,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 12, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care. Concerning the recordings of Krsna dasa Babaji, how can I make any judgment as I have not heard them. However, you should just go on chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra and the Pancatattva mantra and don't divert your attention. You cannot understand the meaning of the Indian songs and simply parrot like chanting of these songs has no value.

Concerning making a comparative study and critique of philosophy, unless one is very expert it is difficult for him. First of all, let people understand Krishna. We are doing that. Maybe one or two are interested in philosophy and for so few persons we can't spare so much valuable time. Better to induce everyone to chant Hare Krishna and take prasadam. That will be a mass benevolent activity. In the western countries many Ph.D.'s are out of employment because they did not get any service. We do not want to become great philosophers but rather to understand the philosophy in our own books. If we remain strong in our own literature, we can meet anyone else without any fear.

As soon as the palace is complete, I shall go again. I very much appreciated how everyone is living peacefully and happily at New Vrindaban.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
