====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

Detroit

My dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings. I have received the threads from you for the three boys and I am enclosing them herewith duly chanted by me. Now you can hold a fire yajna and give sacred thread to Parivrajakacarya, Santosa, and Indradyumna. Play the Gayatri mantra tape for them, and let them repeat the mantras along with my vibration, word for word, and then hang the sacred thread on their necks as usual. Teach them how to count on the finger divisions. This Gayatri Mantra function should be held amongst the devotees only. So you can hold the fire yajna for all five devotees. I am enclosing herewith also three copies of Gayatri Mantra.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
