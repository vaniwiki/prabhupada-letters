====== Letter to: Candravali ======

Sebastapol, California

My dear Candravali,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 7th, 1977.

Regarding keeping the cows, unless there is sufficient grazing land and cultivation, it is very difficult. But there has been some discussion about having a farm in California. You may write to Ramesvara Maharaja and Satsvarupa Maharaja in this regard. In any case the cows must be protected and cared for. If the farm is gotten then they can shifted there, otherwise continue to care for them as best you can.

I hope this finds you and your children well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
