====== Jayagovinda ======

My dear Jaya Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 23, 1969, sent along with your German language __Back To Godhead.__ It is very, very nice. You have achieved a great blessing from my Guru Maharaja. My Guru Maharaja had an ambition to publish the message of Lord Caitanya in all the languages of the world, and when He was present in India, He published six magazines in five languages; one in Hindi, one in Assami, one in Bengali, one in English, and one in Oriya. Your __Zuruck Zur Gottheit__ is certainly a unique gift to me, and I shall ever remember it. It is all your credit that as soon as you arrived in Germany you have done some tangible service to the mission. May Krishna bless you more and more. And as you wish that this service may continue throughout all your life and the next, so it gives me more pleasure about your sincerity of service. I am also glad to know that sometimes the happiness you feel is very strong. There is some words spoken by Lord Caitanya that this service is a transcendental ocean of bliss. __Ananda ambudhi bardanam.__ Here we have got experience of the material ocean; it does not increase. On the other hand, gradually it is decreasing. Formerly the whole planet was merged into water, and there was no earth; it ws simply inundated water. Now gradually the ocean is drying up, and the land is coming out. Therefore, this material ocean is decreasing, but the transcendental ocean of bliss is only increasing. So I can only say that you stick to your present nice service, entrusted upon you by my Guru Maharaja and Krishna. Try to improve it to your best capacity. You are three, just like Brahma, Visnu, and Maheswar. And Mandali Bhadra is going to join you as Indra. These four principal demigods are controlling the whole universe, so I hope in the near future Sivananda, yourself, Krishna Das, and Mandali Bhadra will have full control over the German young boys by pushing on this magazine __Zuruck Zur Gottheit.__ I shall be glad to hear whether by this time Mandali Bhadra has arrived there.

Regarding my going to Hamburg, I am writing to Krishna Das separately, and you will understand the situation. Regarding New Vrindaban, I think we shall have many advantages here that are not in Vrindaban in Mathura. The Vrindaban in Mathura is now congested with so many worldly men. Formerly, Vrindaban was excavated by the Goswamis, and only pure devotees were going there. But at the present moment, this has become a place for the __bischovs,__ materialists, and in the interior part of Vrindaban there are so many rogues and robbers. Formerly, a devotee could live peacefully in any corner of Vrindaban; it is about 180 square miles, but now if somebody lives in some secluded corner, he will be attacked by so many rogues and robbers. Perhaps you know there is a place known as Nandagram, wherein Bon Maharaja has got a place. I have heard that it is very nice, but nobody can live there securely. So at least in New Vrindaban I hope there will be no such disturbances. If we nicely organize as it is going on now, only selected persons will live there and peacefully cultivate Krishna Consciousness.

You have inquired why Caitanya Mahaprabhu has not mentioned anything about accepting a Spiritual Master in His Siksastaka. But perhaps you have missed the point that He says __amanina manadena kirtaniya sada hari.__ This means one has to chant the Holy Names of Krishna, becoming humbler than the straw, and more tolerant than the tree. So who can become humbler than the straw unless he accepts a Spiritual Master? The whole world is puffed up. Everyone wants to become the Lord of everything. Ultimately, the Mayavadi philosopher wants to become one with the Supreme Lord. This means that when one fails to become Lord of everything, he wants to mix up with the Supreme Lord and tries in that way to automatically become Lord of everything. What he can't perform by his own capacity he wants to have done by being merged into the Supreme Lord. That is the mentality of the general people. But if anyone becomes humbler than the grass and more tolerant than the tree, it is understood that he has accepted a Spiritual Master. Besides that, if we accept Sikshastak as authority given by Lord Caitanya, this means we accept Lord Caitanya as Spiritual Master. In the __Bhagavad-gita__ it is openly mentioned that Arjuna accepted Krishna as the Spiritual Master. There is another mention in the Sikshastak, Lord Caitanya says "I do not want any wealth of this world, I do not want any following, neither do I want a beautiful wife. Simply I want to become a servant of the Lord." To become the servant of the Lord means to accept a Spiritual Master. Without accepting somebody as master, how can one become an expert servant? It is not that in every literature you will find the words that everyone has to accept a Spiritual Master, but we have to study things scrutinizingly. In the __Caitanya Caritamrta__ there is mention __guru krsna krpaya paya bhakti lata bija__ [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|(Cc. Madhya 19.151)]]. By the mercy of the Spiritual Master and Krishna one can get the seeds of __bhakti lata,__ the plant of devotional service.

I am glad that you have named your printing press the Radha Press. It is very gratifying. May your Radha Press be enriched in publishing all our books and literatures in the German language. It is a very nice name. Radharani is the best, topmost servitor of Krishna, and the printing machine is the biggest medium at the present moment for serving Krishna. Therefore, it is really a representative of Srimati Radharani. I like the idea very much. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
