====== Ranadhira ======

My dear Ranadhira,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 28th, 1969, and your attitude of a humble devotee is very much appreciated. Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught us to be humbler than the grass on the street and more tolerant than the tree, and thus chant Hare Krishna Maha Mantra without any impediments.

I have seen you when I was in New Vrindaban, and you are quite fit to take charge of New Vrindaban asrama. Take especially nice care of the boys there. They are our future hopes. I have not heard anything from Satyabhama or Paramananda for some time, so please inform me of their whereabouts at present. In Hayagriva's letter I understand he doesn't want much to be interfered with by others, so you do the management very nicely so that everything may go on smoothly.

Thanking you once more for your letter, I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
