====== Jayadvaita ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jayadvaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 5, 1972, and have noted the contents. Yes, because no one else can do them, I shall do the sanskrit synonyms. You simply send me now the manuscripts as required by you, and I shall send back either dictaphone tapes or tape-recorder cassettes. There is presently shortage of tape-recorder cassettes here in India, so if you can send a few that would be a help. One thing is you must send them in small packets of a few tapes each, clearly marked "unsolicited gift, value less than $5, no commercial value," like that. You may send to Calcutta ISKCON before 29th this month, otherwise send to Bombay.

I think Pradyumna is feeling morose about his wife, that is not good so he will not be able to work. Therefore better let him come and live with me here in India and I shall train him properly in sanskrit language. He may come immediately, in time for Mayapur festival beginning by 25th this month. In this way, he can fly directly from New York to Calcutta and live with me.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
