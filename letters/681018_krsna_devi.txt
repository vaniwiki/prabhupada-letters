====== Letter to: Krsna Devi ======

My dear Krishna devi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your long letter dated Oct. 13, 1968. I am so glad to read it that you are writing your letter from hospital, and I thank you very much that you are so much enthusiastic that even in hospital bed, you are thinking of serving Krishna in different ways.

When I received the news sent me by your husband to Jayananda that you are going to be operated, I was little bit perturbed, but immediately I submitted my prayer to Krishna, and I am so glad that Krishna is so merciful. He has saved your life and your baby, it is very much pleasing to me. So I am so much grateful to Krishna, and you should also know that how much grateful we should all be to Krishna. Actually, your case was life and death, without Krishna's Mercy you could not be saved. At least one life was at risk, either your baby's life, or your life. But Krishna is so kind that He has saved both of you. Now feeling this obligation to Krishna, you should be more enthusiastic to serve Krishna and I am very pleased to learn that you have got a nice beautiful Krishna Conscious child, so raise her to full Krishna Consciousness, and engage yourself, your husband, then the family will be very beautiful happy family. You will enjoy in this world, and in the next world. So it is all very nice by the Grace of Krishna.

I am going to Montreal on the 23rd October, 1968, and from there I shall go to Santa Fe, and from there I shall go to Los Angeles. I understood that Dinesh was to see me this Sunday, but if it is not possible to see me on Sunday, then the next chance will be to see me at Los Angeles. I think the Sankirtana party can sell the records very nicely, and you can directly correspond with Tamala Krishna. They are also going to Los Angeles just after my departure.

Hope this will find you in good health, and pray to Krishna for your quick recovery.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
