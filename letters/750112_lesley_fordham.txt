====== Letter to: Lesley Fordham ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Bhaktin Lesley Fordham,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for participating in this sankirtana movement. I am glad to hear that you are enthusiastic about chanting. Keep chanting 24 hours if possible. This constant chanting of Krishna's names will assure you of not falling down from His service. Never leave the association of devotees, otherwise it will be very difficult to chant constantly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
