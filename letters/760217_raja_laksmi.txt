My dear Raja Laksmi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9 February, 1976.

My advise is always chant 16 rounds minimum and follow the four regulative principles. All of my disciples must agree on this point otherwise they are not my disciples. Let one live anywhere, but stick to the principles. Disagreements will continue in this material world. So one may live in a suitable place, but one must follow these five principles. My disciples must follow these principles living either in heaven or hell.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
