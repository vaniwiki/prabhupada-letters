====== Letter to: Nandakisora ======

My dear Nanda Kisora,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of (undated), asking me if you could go to Mexico City to learn Spanish language for opening centers in South America.

Learning Spanish is a difficult job. How can you learn? I am very much enthusiastic about expansion of our branches, but if it is dependent upon learning of Spanish language, don't take this adventure. We should serve Krishna in whatever talents we have already got. However if you are still very much anxious to go there, and you think that you shall be able to get along without knowing Spanish language, then you may go there immediately and push on this Movement. The idea is to recruit active speakers who also speak English to translate and be trained for administering things locally---you simply organize everything and instruct them, and gradually they will take over full management.

Hoping this meets you in good health and jolly mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
