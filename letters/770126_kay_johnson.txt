Dear Kay Johnson;

Please accept my greetings. I have received your letter dated January 7th along with checks totaling $110.00 and I thank you very much.

The best thing is if you come and live with us for some time and learn thoroughly the Krsna science. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu said anyone can become a guru in the matter of teaching about Krsna, provided he or she thoroughly learns the Krsna science. Don't consider Krsna - in any stage - as material. He and His Pastimes are completely spiritual.

In the Gita it is said that out of millions of persons one becomes spiritually fixed in perfection, called siddhis; such a person is a siddha. Our of many millions of siddhas, one may be able to understand Krsna as He actually is. Therefore, before writing about Krsna, I request you to learn the science very well. If you live with us and study Krsna in the process then your writing will be very effective and Krsna will bless you. Otherwise, if you write about Krsna certainly you will indirectly be benefited because you will indirectly chant the Holy Name. But I advise you to learn Krsna as He is and then write about Him. That is my request.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
