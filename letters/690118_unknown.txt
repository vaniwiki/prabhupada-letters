NB: An Indian gentleman, one B. P. Parikh B.A. D. education has written to me to say that being inspired by your "devotion to Krishna and being fascinated by your character, discipline, and devotional surrender to the Lord, he has been drawn to your activities." For this I am very much proud of you. Please maintain this status and certainly you will be welcomed everywhere.
