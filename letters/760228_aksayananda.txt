My dear Aksayananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 23rd February, 1976.

If we get chance, we must open a center in Kanpur. It is a very important city in India. I heard that there was someone who was willing to give us a house. Kanpur is the third most important city in India next to Calcutta and Bombay. We must open a center there, if there is a chance.

Padampat Singhania can himself build the whole gurukula. Similarly Banthuram Jaipuria who is our member, I think, can build the whole thing. If anyone gives the whole money for the building, then we can call the building in his name. The mercantile community is advised to follow the brahmanas. So you are bona fide brahmanas. And if the Vaisyas follow your instruction, they will be happy and pious.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
