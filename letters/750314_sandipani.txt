My dear Sandipani dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 21, 1975 and have noted the contents. I thank you for you kind sentiments and I am glad to hear that you are feeling happy in Krishna's service. This is a good sign of advancement. Keep yourself strong in all respects by following very carefully all of our rules and regulations without fail. If you try sincerely, Krishna will help you, He will supply all strength and ability.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
