====== Bali Mardan ======

My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice poetry. These words are very appropriate for my Guru Maharaj. Your sentiments and nice words are worthy to be offered to my Guru Maharaj. I am quite unfit for such words. Whatever I am doing, it is due to the work of my Guru Maharaj. Actually, He is the power behind me, and I am only instrument. But anyway, I very much appreciate your understanding of the Krishna Conscious Movement, and I wish to publish this poetry in __Back To Godhead__. I am also very glad to learn that now you have got a house also. It is all Krishna’s Grace that so quickly you have established a center in Japan, which I cherished for a long time.

Please convey my blessings to Sudama and keep me informed of your activities regularly. I am sending herewith a copy of a photograph recently taken by Gurudas, and I hope you will like it.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
