====== Saurabha ======

Vrindaban

My dear Saurabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I have received one letter from Swami Bon Maharaja regarding his meeting with you to show you the land he is willing to spare for our Gurukula project. Which land did he show you? What is the area of the land? Is it suitable for Gurukula?

I want the land just in front of our temple. The entrance to the Gurukula will be on the road, and we shall partition this land from the rest of the land with a wall.

I shall talk further in detail with Bon Maharaja personally when I return there to Vrindaban.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
