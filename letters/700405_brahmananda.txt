====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

Boston

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. When I was going to Europe via New York, I asked you to pick up some file "Vrindaban" ("Radha Damodara Temple") and you picked it. I told you that this file is very important and keep it carefully.

I am not finding this file with the consignment of books. Please try to find out where is that file, it is very important.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
