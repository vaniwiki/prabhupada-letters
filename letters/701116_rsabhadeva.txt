====== Rsabhadeva ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Rsabhadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your encouraging letter dated October 1st, 1970, and your appreciations of devotional service in Krsna Consciousness are very nice.

Now you are placed in a responsible post, so I may request you to very carefully execute the regular program as you have learned it in Los Angeles. If the regulative principles are strictly followed there is no chance of maya's dangerous influence to come in and cause some havoc. Maya is always peeping, ready to take advantage of our any lapse from devotional standard, so everyone should be continuously engaged in either chanting, studying or working and preaching. This full schedule will save you from engagement elsewhere. Maya and Krsna are always side by side. Either one is serving Krsna or he is serving Maya. Please manage the affairs of your temple in close cooperation with Karandhara and your Godbrothers and Krsna will give you the good intelligence to progress nicely.

You have remarked how the students on campus receive our devotees and Krsna philosophy so well. It is a fact that they are eagerly looking for some real meaning in life and that reality is Krsna. So you must carry on work on the campuses very diligently and try to impress them with the importance of Krsna Consciousness. I am very pleased to know that Sriman Singh is helping by speaking to campus authorities and students Krsna consciously at UCI. That is a very large University and many highly intelligent boys, girls and faculty can be approached therefore joining our program.

I am especially happy when you write how each devotee is executing his particular task with enthusiasm and they are chanting at least the required sixteen rounds daily. Everyone should think that he has been assigned this particular task to do by Krsna and he should be satisfied with that and do his best to accomplish the work as nicely as possible for the pleasure of Krsna only. By this cultivation of service attitude one swiftly advances in devotional service.

Please offer my blessings to all the devotees there. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
