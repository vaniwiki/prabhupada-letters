====== Hansadutta ======

Vrindaban

My dear Hansadutta Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8 September 1976 and have noted the contents. On your recommendation I am accepting David Davidson as my first initiated disciple. His name shall be Visnudutta das. Also on your recommendation I am accepting Parajnana das brahmacari as my second initiated disciple and the thread is found enclosed. He may see me for the mantra and both may have fire sacrifice as you may find convenient.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
