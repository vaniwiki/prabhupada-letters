====== Nityananda ======

New Orleans

My dear Nityananda Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 2nd February, 1971 and have noted the contents, I am so glad to hear that you and your wife Kanya Kumari (Carol) have gone with one brahmacari, Pavanadeva (Peter), for opening a center in New Orleans. Thank you very much. I am so much appreciative to you American boys and girls for helping me fulfill the order of my Guru Maharaja. Simply you are going, husband and wife, chanting Hare Krishna, and preaching pure Krishna Consciousness. May Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu bestow upon you His full blessings.

Now you are beginning to preach at the universities. That is a very good program, so increase it more and more. It is also a good opportunity for distributing our books. You should give much effort for book distribution, it is such a valuable service. Simply if one will read our KRSNA book, TLC, NOD, and Bhagavad-Gita As It Is, he will surely become a Krishna Conscious person. So somehow or other distribute these books, either in schools and colleges, libraries, through life membership, bookstores, or wherever else you think they might be accepted. Do so with enthusiasm and determination and Krishna will surely help you.

Enclosed please find beads for Kanya Kumari and Pavanadeva duly chanted on by me, as well as letters addressed to them also.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
