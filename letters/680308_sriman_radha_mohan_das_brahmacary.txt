My Satsvarupa,

I have duly received your reports of Istagosti. They are very much interesting. Smt. Jadurani’s replies are very appropriate also(?). I am glad to learn that both in N.Y. and Boston the propaganda work is going on nicely. Similar reports are from Montreal. In San Francisco the kirtan is very nicely going on. I am leaving S. F. today. The tapes should be returned there hence forward. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
