====== Sri Govinda ======

Evanston, Illinois

My dear Sri Govinda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 3rd, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your purchasing marble Gaura-Nitai deities, it is not necessary when you already have brass ones. Simply take care of the ones that you have very nicely. There is no need for buying others.

Concerning the woman's duty, if she gets married, that does not necessarily mean that she must give up any of her service in the temple or on sankirtana, but she must also see to it that her household duties are not neglected.

Yes, I want to come there again this year for the Rathayatra festival and presently you can arrange that interview with Hugh Hefner, if it is possible to have it during that time.

I have accepted the devotees that you have recommended for 1st initiation and their names are as follows: Randall---Rathayatra dasa, Joseph---Jayakrsna dasa, Rodney---Ramakeli dasa, Ron---Ramananda dasa, Susan---Suprabha devi dasi, Deby---Danasila devi dasi. Their beads can be chanted by Kirtanananda Svami.

I have also accepted, upon your recommendation, the five men for 2nd initiation. Let them hear the gayatri mantra through the right ear from the tape of myself chanting it. Their threads are enclosed along with mantra sheet. Make sure that everyone is pure by following the four regulated principles and chanting at least 16 rounds daily. Without these things, there is no spiritual life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
