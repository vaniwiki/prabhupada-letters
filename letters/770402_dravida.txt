====== Dravida ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Dravida das,

Please accept my blessings.

You may be knowing that we have formed one party of scientists under the leadership of Sriman Svarupa Damodara prabhu. Also we have formed the Bhaktivedanta Institute for organizing scientific presentations of Krishna Consciousness. This party is our most important preaching arm with which we will be able to destroy the bogus speculation and cheating which goes under the banner of scientific advancement. Therefore I have got great hope for Svarupa Damodara and his colleagues. I want them to travel vigorously throughout the world to lecture in all universities and other institutions. There is no lack of financial resources and we shall spare nothing to see to this party's success.

His party already consists of Madhava prabhu, Sadaputa prabhu, Ravindra Svarupa prabhu, and himself, and he has approached me that he would like you to help with the editing work as they are publishing scientific papers. In consultation with Ramesvara Maharaja try to have whatever work you are doing assumed by others so that you can free yourself for working with Svarupa Damodara. You may contact Svarupa Damodara, who is returning to America, for more details.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
