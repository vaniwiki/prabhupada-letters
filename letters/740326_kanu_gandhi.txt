====== Kanu Gandhi ======

Boston

Dear Kanu Gandhi,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 16 March, 1974.

Regarding the sale of the temple building at 40 North Beacon St., the best thing is to go and consult with our president in charge of the Boston branch, Trai das Adhikari.

Your desire to keep a personal temple room in your home is commendable, and you can do that in any case, wherever you are, by keeping an altar and offering your food to the Lord as prasadam. Our main purpose for keeping a large temple, however, is for inviting the public. I came to the U.S.A. just to try to give a chance to as many people as possible to take to Krishna Consciousness, because it is the only hope for humanity in this increasingly demoniac, godless age. So if you are seriously interested in maintaining a Vaisnava temple, why not go and try to help my disciples there in Boston, whether they are going to sell and relocate or remain, if you are financially able to assist them, that will be taken by Krishna as a great service. The young men and women at the ISKCON temple are giving everything they have for giving others a chance to come and worship at an authorized Radha-Krishna temple, so I request you to inquire into their situation and help them maintain our Vaisnava temple in the important city of Boston.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
