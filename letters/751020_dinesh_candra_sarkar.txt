My dear Dinesh Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22nd. October, 1975 and I have noted the contents carefully.

I am not keeping always very well. At the present moment I have some trouble with my teeth. By the end of the month, I shall go to Bombay where I shall decide to go either to Calcutta or Vrindaban. Please find out if there is any good big house for sale near where you stay. If so, please send me the details to the Bombay address.

If you keep in contact with the Calcutta temple they will also let you know when I am coming. Thank you very much.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
