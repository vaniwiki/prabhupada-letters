====== Tilaka (Evalyn) ======

Seattle

My dear Tilaka Devi Dasi (Evalyn),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter dated 11th June, 1971 asking for initiation and you will be glad to know that I have accepted you as my duly initiated disciple. Your beads have been chanted on and are enclosed herewith. Your spiritual name is Tilaka Devi Dasi. Tilaka means victory personified.

So now you have taken to Krishna Consciousness wholeheartedly and I am so pleased to hear how enthusiastic you are for serving the Spiritual Master and for serving your husband also. That is your duty. You are your husband's better half and as such it is your duty to assist him in every way possible so that he can nicely execute Krishna Consciousness. Especially Makhanlal has taken charge of our Seattle temple and that is a big responsibility, so you must give him all assistance and all encouragement.

And at the same time you must keep yourself fit in Krishna Consciousness. The process is very simple: Chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily; follow all the regulative principles strictly; read our books; attend aratis and classes, as well as street Sankirtana. In this way engage yourself in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will become a pillar of spiritual strength for your husband.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
