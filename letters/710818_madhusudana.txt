====== Madhusudana ======

My dear Madhusudana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13rd August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far your choice of artwork for BTG, I do not know the artistic sense. I am a layman and do not know the techniques. But the picture you have enclosed appeals to me, so it may be used. I have no objection.

The point is that these drawings should be realistic. Not that you make Krishna a cartoon character and therefore laughing stock. And hippy ideas shouldn't be used either. Whatever technique is there, make it realistic. That will be nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
