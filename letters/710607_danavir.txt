San Francisco

My dear Danavir,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th May, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am glad to note how you are working for securing ads for the special Rathayatra magazine. We have made such ads for our programs here in India and it has been very successful. Of course in India when they are paying for an ad, they are actually giving a donation, but it is registered as an ad. But in U.S.A. unless they are seeing the circulation and how much they will be benefited, they won't spend. They are simply after the advertisement. But go on with your program enthusiastically and Krishna will help you.

Presently I am in Bombay and from here I will be going to London and perhaps to Moscow for a short time. From there I will be going to N.Y. and then on to Los Angeles. I am very much wanting to attend the Rathayatra festival in San Francisco and if time permits and Krishna so desires, then I shall reach there by the time of the festival. And when I go there, I shall be very glad to appear on such television conference as described in your letter. So go ahead and try for it. And if you can approach such big companies for support, that will be very good also. Try your best and Krishna will help you.

So far as getting yourself married, I have no objection. If it is all right with Kesava Prabhu, then you have my blessings. And Jaga Dasi can become initiated also when I come there.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
