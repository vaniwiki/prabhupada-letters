====== Letter to: Bali-mardana ======

My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated 8th July, and I was expecting to receive it every moment.

So Tirthapada has gone there and that is a good news, so all of you are experienced devotees. I have already written two letters separately, one to Upendra and one to Tirthapada. Now combinedly go on with your preaching work.

I am very glad to know that you are keeping your accounts up to date with BTG and the book fund. This is good and proper management. So you continue to keep these accounts weekly.

I am also very glad to know that you think Melbourne a good place for establishing a temple and you are eager to accept this establishment of temples in the Australia area as your life and soul. Yes, as I have taken this work as my life and soul on the order of my Spiritual Master, similarly if you take my desires as life and soul, then the whole thing is immediately connected with Krsna. That is the meaning of Parampara system. None of the activities are personal affairs. It comes only through the proper channel, otherwise each and every activity is directly connected with Krsna. It is received through the Spiritual Master, but the business is for Krsna as much as an office superintendent is the via media for pleasing the ultimate master.

Kindly execute the Deity worship very properly. Upendra has got good experience. Tirthapada has also got good experience. Follow the program as we are doing in Los Angeles and London. I think all of you are twice initiated, so there will be no difficulty in executing the Deity worship. Our __Nectar of Devotion__ and __KRSNA__ are already published and these two books alone can keep any one in Krsna consciousness perpetually.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
