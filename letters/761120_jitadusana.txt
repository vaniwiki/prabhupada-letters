====== Letter to: Jitadusana ======

Los Angeles

My dear Jitadusana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated Nov. 10, 1976.

Devotional service does not depend on material assessment. It is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam, "ahaituki apratihata". Devotional service must be without any material ambition and there is no material impediment which can check advancement in devotional service. Srila Gaura Kisora das Babaji was unable to sign his name, and yet he became the spiritual master of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja, the most erudite learned scholar of His time. We should begin our devotional service in whichever position we are. It isn't that we have to learn something extra for advancing in devotional service.

If one is materially well equipped it is welcome but devotional service does not depend on material qualifications.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
