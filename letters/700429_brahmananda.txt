====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

Boston

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of the text proof for BTG #32. I am looking through it now, and will return it to you soon.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
