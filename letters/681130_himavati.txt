====== Himavati ======

My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. Yesterday my deities were dressed with the clothing you made and it appears so nice. I do not know whether you have time to make similarly a few other sets. It will be very nice. I know that you are the most expert in making dresses than all others so therefore I request you that you may make at least two or three sets of dresses as you have already made.

I hope that everything is well with you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
