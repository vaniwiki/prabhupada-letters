====== Vrikodara ======

New Orleans

My dear Vrikodara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 8, 1976.

Upon your recommendation I will accept the devotees you have recommended as my duly initiated disciples. Now hold a fire sacrifice. Instruct them on the offenses to be avoided while chanting the Holy Names. They must promise to always chant a minimum of 16 rounds and strictly follow the four regulative principles. Balavanta may chant on their beads. Their new names are; Victor---Vedanta Krt dasa, Albert---Ananda dasa, Paul---Paramatma dasa.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
