====== Ranadhira ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ranadhira dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 17, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

This is to certify that you should send the Back-to-Godhead magazine regularly to Sridhara Swami in Navadvipa as already requested. I am glad to see that you are now conscientiously executing your duty. Always check with me first before sending out any literature to persons who have not been specifically approved by me.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
