====== Tejiyas ======

Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. Just as I was leaving for Tirupati from Hyderabad I received your telegram reading as follows: "Require checks Rupees Twenty-one thousand seven hundred in favor Punjab National Bank for Steel and rupees Fifteen thousand to PNB Delhi for transfer to Vrindaban." This kind of requesting for checks by telegram without proper explanation is whimsical. Especially to ask for a check to PNB Delhi to transfer to Vrindaban. The construction fund should only be used for construction items like cement and iron and the party's name should be mentioned. Because you may need these checks urgently I am sending them enclosed here, but please send a letter giving a proper account.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
