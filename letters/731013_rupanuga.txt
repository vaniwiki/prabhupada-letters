My dear Rupanuga Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 29, 1973 together with the campaign materials. Regarding Guyana, if the money is there, so you open an office and print books. That will be all right. Yes, Kesava may be GBC man for South America. That is approved by me. And you can incorporate Central America into the Eastern Zone. So do it with great enthusiasm. I am very glad to learn that men are joining in Santo Domingo. So far as getting a non-American for going to Cuba, you can take a man from Mexico.

I am very glad to learn of the book distribution. You keep the paperbook editions. Why people should pay unnecessarily? Regarding your question about the spiritual world and the material world, there may be maya, but one who is Krsna conscious has nothing to do with it, exactly like there is the police department but the law abiding citizen has nothing to do with it. In the Bhagavad-gita it is stated: __daivi hy esa gunamayi/ mama maya duratyaya/ mam eva ye prapadyante/ mayam etam taranti te.__ [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]]. In answer to your other question, yes, the heat is bodily temperature.

Regarding the initiations, I accept the following as my disciples:

Anupama Das (Rupa Goswami's younger brother)---Frank

Nikhilesvari dasi---Nora\\
Also enclosed is one sacred thread for Vrajajana Das Brahmacari. . So you can chant on the beads and perform the sacrifice. I also give the gayatri mantra second initiation to Bhagyavati dasi. You can give them the translation right away.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
