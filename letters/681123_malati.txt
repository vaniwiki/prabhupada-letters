====== Malati ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Malati,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter of Nov. 15, 1968, and I have noted the contents with great satisfaction. Your humble sentiments are very nice exposed herein, and your sincere desire to serve the Lord is the real perfection of life.

You have asked if I found it difficult to carry on devotional service when in my household life, and yes, I did. In my household life I was strictly following the regulative principles but my wife was reluctant to assist me properly. Therefore I was obliged to give up their company. You try to take care of Lord Jagannatha as far as possible after doing your household duties, but you should be strict only in completing the 16 rounds of chanting. That will save you from all discrepancies. As a householder even there is some flaws in following the rules and regulations, it doesn't matter. You should try your best and with Krishna's help---Krishna will help you. If you keep your heart in that attitude, that you want to become a pure and sincere devotee, you must be a sincere devotee. And Krishna will help you. You have to keep your heart in that way, that is your business. I hope you are well, with your child.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
