My dear Yadubara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 16, 1974 and I have noted the contents carefully.

I just saw your film last night and it was very nice. We can collect a lot of money with this film, for ISKCON Food-relief program. But not a single farthing of that money should be used for any other thing. It should all go to our ISKCON food-relief fund, nothing else. Otherwise we will definitely run into trouble, such as Hansadutta has in Germany.

As far as your future films are concerned I do not think it is possible for the BBT to continue financing these films. BBT is strictly for construction of temples and printing books. My idea is that you can use the original capital that BBT gave you. You don't have to pay that back. You can somehow or another, by business tactics increase that capital and employ it again to make a new film. Then again use the capital from that film or use the profit from that film to create another film, etc. In this way you can make many films. But I do not think that BBT should finance it. These films are very nice and they can be effectively used for our preacing work. Generally people enjoy seeing any film. But when a film has something substantial such as our Krsna Conscious philosophy to offer then it becomes a real pleasure. Therefore our films should be the most popular films ever produced. Try to distribute this and your original first film as widely as possible and in this way the finances will be easily obtained for producing further films.

Please continue chanting 16 rounds daily, rising early, attending mangal arati and classes, and following the 4 regulative principles. By following this simple formula as I have given from the very beginning your life will be completely free from anxiety.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
