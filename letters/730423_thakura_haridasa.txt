====== Letter to: Thakura Haridasa ======

My dear Thakura Haridasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 21, 1973 and also the screenplay "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" from Mr. Diamond. So it is good work that you are getting important man to understand the importance of Krishna consciousness in the modern world. If the important men of your country use their wealth to support this movement then the whole face of the society can be changed. Just like the scientists they are getting millions of dollars from the government for their researches. But, have they been able to cure death, disease, old age, and birth? That is not possible for them because they are ignorant of spiritual science as given by Krishna in Bhagavad-gita. So we have to push this knowledge in the world and so money is required. So it is very nice Mr. Diamond has given $3,000.00 for the Book Trust, that is practical help.

I can understand from the play he is talented man. Now you have to impress upon hm, that when talent is used to glorify the Supreme Lord, that is perfection of talent. . Just like one of our students, he is scientist, Ph.d, and he can present God by scientific statement. He has written one small book presenting God consciousness based on scientific statement very nicely so we are publishing it.

So I request you to seriously become convinced of this Krishna consciousness movement as you are understanding it and by strictly following the rules I have given you, you will get strength to convince others nicely.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
