====== Kirtanananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of July 3, 1969, sent along with the cheese. But the cheese has gone bad. Perhaps you did not note it what I said that this cheese should be made into sandesh; that is 1/4 part of cheese should be mixed with sugar and fried in a pan, constantly stirring till it is almost hard. Then after taking it down, knead it nicely and then prepare small balls. This sandesh can be kept at least for a fortnight without damage, but cheese cannot be kept more than three days. It reached me, but it had gone sour. If you can prepare sandesh and send it to me, it will be very nice. So try it, and if it comes out successful, you can send it to me.

I am glad that Devananda is tending the Deities very nicely. He has learned this art directly under my supervision, so I hope he is doing it nicely. Your kirtana program as it is going on is very nice. You have kept the Vrindaban spirit so sublimely that I always remember it and always hanker when I shall go back again. In the meantime I am enjoying the tape which I recorded of your morning prayers and chanting. Here in Los Angeles also the temple is very gorgeous, and I am receiving reports from other centers that they are also doing nicely. I shall be going to San Francisco by the 25th or 26th of July, and from there I may be going to Germany, because they also want me there. Krishna das has already purchased one ticket for me, but I asked him to postpone it till the end of the month. In London they have secured a house, and I understand it is very nice. But it is in office quarters, so there will be difficulties to use it as a living house. Anyway, whatever Krishna desires He will do.

In the meantime I have written one letter to Hayagriva regarding transfer of New Vrindaban in the society's name. I am glad that the girls there are taking my suggestions, and if things are done according to program, New Vrindaban will surely develop to the highest extent. You may inform Satyabhama that I have already received the __Krishna__ book which she has sent.

Please convey my blessings to all the other inhabitants of New Vrindaban. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
