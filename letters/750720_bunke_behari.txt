My dear Bunke Behari das:

Please accept my blessings. I wish to thank you very much for ivory carving gift which you have kindly presented to me. You have made it very nicely. I can see that it required skill to make it so artistically. You have made Radha and Krishna and Caitanya Mahaprabhu very attractively.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
