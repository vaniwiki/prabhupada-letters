My dear Dr. Wolf,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter post dated November 12, 1975 and have read the contents carefully. So it appears that the sun planet comes first and then the moon planet. That is the statement in Srimad-Bhagavatam. How do modern scientists say that the moon is nearest from the earth? What is their authority? But according to what is stated by you, the sun is first and then the moon. That is the verdict of Srimad-Bhagavatam. If the moon is beyond the sun, then how they can go to the moon while they are unable to go to the sun? This is the problem I am thinking and if you can make a solution, that would be nice.

According to Srimad-Bhagavatam the moon is above the sun planet by 1,600,000 miles. The scientists say that the sun is 93,000,000 miles from the earth and if the moon is beyond the sun planet, the distance from the earth then would be 95,000,000 miles. So the moon being 95,000,000 miles away, how can they go even if they travel at the speed of 18,000 mph, how can they go 95,000,000 miles in four days. It is not possible. In four days they can go only 1,728,000 miles.

If they say the moon is 240,000 miles from the earth, then why is the moon not mentioned first? Why not Monday being the first day of the week? According to Srimad-Bhagavatam, the sun is first, the moon is second and therefore we have no objection to the first of the week being Sunday and then Monday. Why is it universally accepted in all languages that Sunday is first and then Monday? Why is it not Monday and then Sunday?

I have noted that you are working with the German translation department. Kindly continue your cooperation. It is Krsna's business and He will be very, very happy.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
