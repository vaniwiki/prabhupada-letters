====== Hansadutta ======

Hamburg

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 3rd August, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am glad to learn that you have now come back to Hamburg. Originally you were there for organizing our movement in central Europe. Now, due to your absence so many things have happened. Krishna Das has left. Your duty is here in Europe. Whatever done is done. You organize there nicely, and stick to that place. Krishna Das has been advised to go to Russia. Presently he can be reached care of San Francisco temple. So be in correspondence with him and help him to get to Moscow. He is very enthusiastic to go there. So stay in Europe and help others---Germany, France, Holland, and organize things nicely.

The Kabul proposal sounds very nice and hippies are already there. If you begin your movement with hippies, then gradually the local inhabitants will take interest. Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted that in every town and village this cult would be spread and the hippies are already spread all over the world and they are our best customer. These hippies are simply frustrated and want something sublime. So we are delivering this sublime movement all over the world and if we do it cautiously and carefully surely we will be successful.

Brahmananda has already gone to Kenya and the response has been very favorable. I hope he will do something tangible there.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
