====== Advaita ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings.

Regarding the printing of the __Nectar of Devotion,__ when Brahmananda was here, he informed me that the printing and bookbinding, everything, would be finished within two weeks, but in the meantime I received one paper bill through Gargamuni for $2,042.40 and another bill for $423.32. Formerly you submitted the statement for 20,000 copies of __Topmost Yoga,__ and again you decided to print another 10,000 copies for which another bill was submitted; so the total amount, $2465.72, has just now been telegraphically transferred to your ISKCON Press account No. 516-5642, in the First National Bank of Boston, so you can do the needful.

For future guidance you will please submit your quotation statement as you have done for the first 20,000 copies of __Topmost Yoga,__ and that will be nice. You submit your statement including all expenditure. There is no need of sending me the parties' bills. I will transfer the money to ISKCON Press account immediately. That will be easier for me. When you send so many bills, it puzzles my brain. Please send the statements of __NOD__ and the second printing of 10,000 copies of __KC:TY.__

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
