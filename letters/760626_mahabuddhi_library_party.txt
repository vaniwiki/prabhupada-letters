====== Letter to: Mahabuddhi, Library Party ======

Bombay

My dear Mahabuddhi das and other members of the library party,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter with enclosed reviews and I thank you very much. The reviews were particularly important.

Why don't you try to arrange with India to extend visa somehow or other? I am very much encouraged by the efforts and response that you are getting from the universities and libraries. Indeed, the field is as good or better than the U.S.A. for this type of work.

That is nice even if the libraries are taking only 6 volumes per year. The libraries that you mentioned: associated with the Ministry of External Affairs, Education, Information and Broadcasting, Defense, and Indian council for cultural relations, they can all take our books. Let them see the certificates given by all these big, big professors.

I remember when I sold the first one volume personally to the Archeological University. I sold them personally long ago. Now you must work conjointly with the other library men in India. Don't let there be undue competition amongst our men. Do combinedly, it is very much encouraging to me.

You can let Vrindaban De work Orissa and W. Bengal and Bihar, and when I go back I shall see how he's working. I am giving him a chance so let me see how he's done. For the time being at least, let him do it until I return.

Now import the books which are needed to carry on supplying all your orders. Gopala Krishna says that he has secured the needed license from Maharashtra Government. It is a very good report so continue to work enthusiastically.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
