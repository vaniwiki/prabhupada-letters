====== Gargamuni ======

Vrndavana

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I have just now received your letter, and I thank you very much for understanding our philosophy correctly. Yes, if one is always engaged in following the orders of the Spiritual Master, even in hell, that is Vaikuntha or Vrindaban. Now I think immediately you should go to Bombay to take charge of one matter while I am away at Mayapur. During our absence, the vacant plot which we have purchased must be levelled, cleared, and at least four latrines constructed, in preparation for the pandal festival which we are holding there throughout month of March. I will be coming back to Bombay about the first of March to %%___%% once in the morning and once in the evening, and we shall %%___%% camp there, so that people may be attracted and some %%____%% may be raised. Now there is one very good boy, Mahamsa %%____%% who is now in charge of things in Bombay, and he has %%____%% experience and is perfectly qualified to manage every %%____%% he is there now. But since he has not got opportunity %%___%% bay for more than one year, because he has always %%____%% behind to look after things, therefore Madhudvisa %%____%% he can come to Mayapur. It will be good if he can %%____%% So you please go there and take instruction from him %%____%% regard to levelling the vacant plot and constructing %%___%% see what progress he has made. He was supposed to have %%___%% use of hiring coolies to level by hand, but it is doubt %%___%% can be done very nicely, so if you think it is better, you %%___%% one machine for levelling the whole thing in one day, and %%___%% have several Life Members in Bombay who are having such machine %%___%% building business. Now do everything nicely, also hold our regular %%___%% kirtana and arati programs daily in the temple, and I shall completely trust this important business to you. I think Madri dasi and Tungabhadra dasi are also there for attending the deities. You write that you have no money, so I have instructed Mahamsa to send you the fare money, and as soon as you receive that you may go there immediately.

Now I have just received a cable from Ksirodakasayi Prabhu that Mr. Saraf has given us the land. We shall gladly accept the offer, so kindly inform Ksirodakasayi to draw up all the legal papers and gift deed for handing the land over to our Society, and he can bring those papers, along with a plan of the plot showing length and width dimensions, and we shall settle up our Vrindaban program when he shall meet me in Mayapur. Meanwhile, Subala Maharaja may remain there for looking after things in Vrindaban and assisting Ksirodakasayi wherever possible. I am very much pleased to know that we shall be raising up a nice center now in Vrindaban, and also in Bombay, so Krishna has been very kind upon us, now let us all work cooperatively and with full enthusiasm to do the needful.

I am enclosing one plot-plan of the Bombay land for your attention. Kindly send me your report c/o our Calcutta branch.

So far the court case is concerned, I do not know how long it will take you to present the case to the court, but in any case you must take the help of some lawyer, and I think it will take some time to prepare. But if you give him all details and documents, why the lawyer cannot deal with the matter in your absence? Also, Subala may assist and make certain that everything is presented properly, and also Ksirodakasayi, if he is there. It is not a difficult problem, only I want assurance that my rooms at Radha-Damodara, that I shall not be obstructed from using them in the future and that something in my favor be settled about the illegal seizure of my entrance veranda, that's all. In other words, I am the legal tenant, and as long as I continue to pay rent, there shall be no interference.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
