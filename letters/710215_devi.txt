My dear Daughter Devi Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one letter from Sriman Sridama Das Adhikari in which he recommends you for initiation into our Krsna consciousness Movement. I have also received your beads, but I have not received any letter from you. Thank you very much for the contribution check for fifty dollars to my book fund. This kind of offering of some gift to the Spiritual Master at the time of initiation is the proper duty of the disciple. This makes the function complete and is required.

I am very glad that a sincere soul like you has become attracted with this Movement of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. That is your very good fortune. Now please take care of your advancement in Krsna consciousness by following strictly the prescribed methods for reviving your dormant love of Krsna. I am very glad to accept you as my initiated disciple and your spiritual name is Srimati Devi Dasi. I am returning your beads duly chanted herewith to you. Please continue to faithfully serve the Lord by chanting His Holy Names sixteen rounds daily on the beads, going on Sankirtana, following the regulative principles and avoiding the ten offenses, working in cooperation to spread this Sankirtana Movement, studying our philosophy carefully and keeping always happy in Krsna Consciousness. You can take good advantage of the association of devotees and be guided progressively by your elder Godbrothers and sisters in the matter of executing your Krsna consciousness without difficulty.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
