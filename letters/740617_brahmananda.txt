====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

Nairobi

My dear Brahmananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of two letters from you dated 4/6/74 and 12/6/74.

I am glad to read that you are eager to join me as my permanent secretary and that your major concern is to help provide me with "a conducive environment to translate" my books. That is my desire also. On the other hand, I can understand the programs are developing in Kenya and therefore you want a strong replacement before you leave Africa. I think Gargamuni Maharaja can do it nicely. I have written him a letter inviting him to go to Africa and also Karandhara has gone to Calcutta to talk with him directly about this. So we shall see whether he is willing.

It is very good news that there are persons there who want to cooperate to help us start a Varnasrama College Project and that they may supply us land for living as an ideal community producing our own food from the land. So this should be followed up carefully.

I was glad to receive you second letter and the letter from the Ministry of Home affairs stating that they have no objection to my coming to Kenya. Yes, I would like to go there after the Vrindaban ceremonies. Hopefully you will have joined me by then and we can go together to Kenya and from there to South Africa where Pusta Krsna Maharaja is trying to arrange a program for our coming.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
