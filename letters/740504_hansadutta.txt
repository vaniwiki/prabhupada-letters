Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 28, 1974 and I have noted the contents.

There is no question of asking you to go away from Bhaktivedanta Manor. I have received word also from other sources that the situation has improved since you have come there. I have sent a detailed letter to Mukunda and this explains my desire.

So I am going to Europe, due to arrive in Rome on May 23rd. Until then, you must remain there and manage. When I go to Europe we will hold a joint meeting, and decide what to do.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
