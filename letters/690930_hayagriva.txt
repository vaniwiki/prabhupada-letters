My Dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 25th, 1969, and I am very much perturbed reading the contending points with Brahmananda. So I am enquiring in this matter. In the meantime, don't be agitated. Sometimes such moments come, but we have to tolerate. That is the instruction of Lord Chaitanya. In the future, I am contemplating that management should be done by you all in combination, but I am sorry that the idea is not very hopeful. Anyway, I shall try to adjust things nicely. Don't worry. In the meantime, go on with your duty, and Krishna will bless you.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
