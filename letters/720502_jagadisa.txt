====== Letter to: Jagadisa ======

Toronto

My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated April 17, and 12, 1972, and I have noted the contents. Let us forget past incidents and let us look forward to rectify our defects. So far you are concerned, I am very much convinced of your sincere service. Go on with your work, and other instructions will follow. Simply become more concerned with increasing the spiritual content of our lives, and in this way all other problems like management will be easily solved, not that they can be solved by making some legal formula and having big big meetings and talks. The politicians have been holding such meetings and talks for some time now and the world is no better place for it, and they have only made things worse. We should not follow their example. The world is in a very precarious condition simply for lack of God-consciousness, so this should be our point of stressing, that we should revive this emphasis on God-consciousness everywhere in the world and that will be our contribution. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
