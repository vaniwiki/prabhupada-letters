====== Sivananda ======

My dear Sivananda,

I have received your letter. You are anxious to get my instructions of your activities. I think there is no need of getting a degree. If you can spare some time, you try to learn Bengali, from Sriman Prabhansu. It will be a great asset for our Mission; and as you have decided to work to get money, I quite approve. Be under the guidance of your elder brothers Janardana and you will progress nicely. Let Pradyumna live there in Boston; I have given him some tasks and he will do them.

Yes you can send the plant. I shall suggest your vibrator to Gaurasundara; and he will do the needful, because he takes care of my body. Hope you are all doing well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
