====== Letter to: Padmagarbha ======

My dear Padmagarbha Das,

Please accept my blessings, I am in due reciept of you letter dated October 22nd, 1974 regarding your proposal to spread Krishna Consciousness in Germany village to village by horse and wagon I do not know if this is a practical suggestion, but if the preaching goes on I have no objection. You can consult with Hansadutta in this connection to see if he approves. Preaching is the important thing and not the mode of transport, So if it can be done I have no objection.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
