====== Revatinandana ======

Los Angeles

My dear Revatinandana Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 24, Oct. 1974 and I have noted the contents.

I am very glad to hear of your program of travelling on the West Coast preaching in the colleges and having radio interviews. This is very encouraging to hear. Actually this preaching work is the duty of a sannyasi. The more he preaches the more he becomes expert and the more the people will accept what he says. So please continue your preaching work and work cooperatively with Jayatirtha Prabhu, and Krsna will give you all facilities.

You mention in your letter that you had heard that I said that you and Syamasundara were engaged in a conspiracy against me and that you felt very bad upon hearing this. Do not feel like that. But in London at the Vyasa Puja ceremony during the offering of flowers you, Syamasundara and Mukunda left the room. So questioned by a devotee I might have said something like that. But forget it now. Yes, I also maintain a hope for Syamasundara. Everyone is hoping that Syamasundara will be able to reestablish himself in Krsna Consciousness again. I do not understand why he is engaged in this business of his if there is not any tangible profit. He says that there is big, big money but still he has not yet paid ISKCON the debt that he has. Therefore what is this business.

I request you to continue following all of the regulative principles staunchly and encourage all other of my disciples in your preaching area to do the same. This is the most important thing. As soon as one discontinues his staunch following of the regulative principles such as no meat eating, no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, rising early before 4:00, coming to mangala arati, chanting at least 16 rounds, etc., then his spiritual life is hampered and there is a chance that at any time he may become a victim of maya. Continue with great enthusiasm this preaching work and inform me from time to time of your current activities. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
