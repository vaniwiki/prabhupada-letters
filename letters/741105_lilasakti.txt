My dear Lilasakti devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 26, 1974 with enclosed photograph of your Krishna. Krishna is so kind that although he is __ajit,__ unconquerable, He can be possessed by the devotee. From love He allows this. This is the great position of the devotee.

I am glad to see that you are advancing in Krishna consciousness by this worship of the Deity. This is the practical application to what we find stated in the Bhagavad-gita, man manah bhava mad bhakto, mad yaji mam namaskuru. We do not speculate on what Krishna says but we follow whatever He says implicitly. I also follow this process. Every morning I go to the temple and see the Deity and offer obeisances, so I expect each and every one of my disciples should also follow what I have given in this connection, arising early, taking bath, attending mangal arati. __yuktasya bhaktams ca niyunjato 'pi.__ The Deity is non-different from Krishna Himself. This we have to understand.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
