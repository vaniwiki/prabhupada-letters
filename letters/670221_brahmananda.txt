====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of the 18th instant and have noted the contents. I am glad to know that the "Happiness On Second Avenue" film has come out very happy. Please see it and let know the result. I hope you have received my last letter suggesting therein the scheme of hire purchase agreement with Mr. Taylor. I have not heard anything from Kirtanananda till now. Neal, one day evening, came here but since then he is not here and do not know if I shall send the recorded tapes or not. Because here there is no typewriter. Howard is not serious about general typewriting.
