====== S.S.M. Dave ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Shri Dave,

I thank you for your letter No. D.O. No. 12(1)/67/13850 of Dec. 29, 1967, and I have noted the contents. I am glad that you are going through the literatures, but I may request you to inquire from His Excellency Shri B. K. Nehru, Governor of Assam, who can give you a first hand knowledge in the matter of my movement of Krishna Consciousness in this country. The Government should also take into consideration about the sentiment of the Maharajah of Jaipur who constructed the temple. The will of the original master must be respected. I am fully prepared to take charge of the terms; but the great temple may be utilized for this cultural propagation which is gaining ground in the Western countries. Even if the Government wants to dispose of the property, still, the first preference should be given to us because we want to maintain the property in terms of the original will of the constructor. I think, therefore, you shall immediately submit your honest decision to the Government without further waiting and let the government take its final decision. Awaiting your early reply.

Yours in the service of the Lord,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, Acharya

S. S. M. Dave, Comissioner\\
