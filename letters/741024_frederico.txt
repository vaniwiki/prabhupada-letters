====== Frederico ======

Lisboa, Portugal

My dear Frederico:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 3, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to learn that you are translating the Bhagavad-gita As It Is into Portuguese. Be careful not to change anything but present it exactly as it is. This is how we receive Bhagavad-gita through the disciplic succession as stated in the Fourth Chapter. By this translating work you will learn our philosophy very nicely. It is very important to broadcast Krishna consciousness all over the world. This is the great need of modern civilization.

If you are going to France why not visit our Paris center. There you should get chanting [japa] beads, and begin chanting Hare Krishna mantra on the beads. They will show you how to do it. This is most important for advancing in spiritual life.

Yes, as you have understood, prasadam is offered only from the category of fruits, vegetables, grains, milk products, and sugar. This is according to the Bhagavad-gita wherein Krishna states what He accepts. We have four rules that all my students follow. They do not take any meat, fish, or eggs; no gambling, no intoxicants, including coffee, tea, or cigarettes; and no illicit sex life. Try to follow these four rules, and Krishna will bless you with quick advancement in spiritual life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
