====== Patita Uddharana ======

My dear Patita Uddharana dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I have understood from Hansadutta Prabhu that you are giving lectures in the temple. I have seen the column from the Gujarati newspaper and I am very pleased. Somebody must speak, and you have taken the task. I offer you my thanks. You are an elder disciple and you have heard what I am speaking, so you should just speak what you have heard and it will have potent effect. This is the power of the __parampara,__ disciplic succession. So you must be prepared to meet all opposition because practically everyone is mayavadi. They do not have faith in Krishna's words in Bhagavad-gita. Therefore we have a great responsibility to present Krishna's words without any change. Please do the needful. Your speaking should be continued.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
