My dear Gurukrpa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have spoken with Sukadeva das Adhikari, the Honolulu Temple President. It appears that because you had made some derogatory racial remarks against him in the presence of other devotees here in the temple, it has become difficult to manage and win the respect of this devotees. If the GBC undermines the efforts of the temple presidents how will things go on smoothly. This situation could have been avoided by sober dealings in a Krsna Conscious manner.

I do not want that Sukadeva be removed from his position as I can see that he is sincerely following the principles at present. The GBC can not whimsically change the temple president, there is a resolution to this effect. Why have you threatened to remove him and unnecessarily created this situation? Please be very sober in your dealings with these temple presidents, they are undoubtedly rendering a valuable service and are worthy of respect and encouragement.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
