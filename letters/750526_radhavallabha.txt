My dear Radhavallabha dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5/17/75 and have noted the contents. I have also received the first volume of the Madhya-lila. It is very nice. The pictures of Jagannatha Puri and the Samadhi tombs of Rupa Goswami, Jiva Goswami, and Krishna das Kaviraja are very nice. I will be very pleased if you can produce these books at top speed. Please do this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
