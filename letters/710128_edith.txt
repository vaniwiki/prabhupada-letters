My dear Edith,

Please accept my blessings, presently I am touring India and so have just now received your letter dated 3d August, 1970 and am replying it herewith.

We are presently in the age; called Kali yuga, or the age of quarrel and dissention where man is very shortlived and not so very intelligent. But the most regrettable characteristic of this age, is that man has forgotten God. He is claiming God is dead or I am god, etc. Just try to understand how much degraded this age is. One of the anomalies, of this Kali yuga is that our foodstuffs have been grown with so many chemicals, etc. Actually nothing in this Kali yuga is pure. The soil is polluted, the air, so many things as well as man's motives, but by firmly establishing our Krishna Consciousness Movement all over the world, such unfavorable conditions can be terminated.

That is our program. So for the present we must tolerate such conditions. Actually, these are material considerations only. By offering our foodstuffs to Krishna with love and devotion, Krishna says he wiil accept and it becomes spiritually purified because he is the supreme pure. So love and devotion to Krishna is the purifying agent and nullifies all the bad effects of this age of Kali yuga. Simply let as offer to Krishna with love and devotion and chant the Hare Krishna Mantra: Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare and our very existence will become purified.

Presently we have established one center of our International Society for Krishna Consciousness in Chicago. The address is as follows 2210 N. Halsted Ave. Chicago. Please visit there and if you have any further questions the devotees there will gladly answer them.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
