My dear Dayananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated September 27, 1974; nil; and October 15, 1974. I understand that due to financial needs you are doing Sankirtana party in order to raise funds. Regarding the solution to your getting the necessary funds as well as your request for men to lead the Sankirtana, this must be decided by the GBC and not myself. If they cannot solve this problem, then what is the meaning of GBC? They must arrange it for you to receive the necessary funds so that you do not have to be asking me for money. This is what I want. So you consult with them, and inform me the result.

Regarding your recommendations for initiations, I accept the following as my disciples and their names are: Mike Pugh---Mayesa dasa; Beverly Pugh---Vaisnavapriya devi dasi; Raymond Crowe---Rajendranandana dasa; Jan Crowe---Lokahita devi dasi; Joe Torres [Joseph Terrones---ed.]---Jyotirmaya dasa; Raymond Kennedy---Ramadeva dasa; Dennis Winiker---Dhanurdhara dasa. I also accept for second initiation Subandhu dasa and Jayasri devi dasi, the sancitified thread and mantra sheets are enclosed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
