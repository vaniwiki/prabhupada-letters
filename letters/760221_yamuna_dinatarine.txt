====== Yamuna, Dinatarine ======

Murphy, Oregon

My dear Yamuna and Dinatarine,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 4, 1976.

Enclosed please find a true copy of my reply to your letter dated December 24th, 1976.

The thing is cow protection is not possible for women. You can keep two or three cows, but on larger scale it is not possible. You should not try to take care of more. It is not women's business. Women's business is getting milk and making milk preparations. On the whole larger scale is not to be attempted by women. Manage a small asram, but don't try bigger scale, then you require the help of men.

Don't try manual exertion, then again there is mixture and that is not desired. Simply keep yourself aloof from men---chanting, many more times as possible, read books, worship the deity. I am very much pleased with this girl Svati---she has adopted this white dress. She must not be attractive at all. A widow is forbidden to use ornaments, nice sari, decoration, combing the hair nicely. These are forbidden for the woman who is not with husband.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
