My dear Hrdayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3d July, 1971 and have noted the contents. All these initiation beads should be kept very carefully and protected. It is not a question of changing beads, but this carelessness, of losing beads, is not very good. You are very intelligent boy, so you should be careful and instruct others also. So keep your beads in a bag and keep the bag around your neck. Then you won't lose.

It was not necessary to send me $10.00 for the beads but since you have so kindly sent, I shall gladly add this sum to my book fund. Thank you very much. Also, I hope you have received my previous letter by now, dated yesterday, in regards to that university lecture.

Yes, it is all right that you address me as Spiritual Father. As I have several times explained, when initiation is given, the Spiritual Master becomes the spiritual father and the gayatri mantra becomes the spiritual mother and thus second birth takes place.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
