====== Jadurani ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated May 9, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding your question about kirtana, practically we are not concerned with the instruments. They are used sometimes to make it sweeter, but if we divert our attention for using the instruments more, that is not good. Generally kirtana is performed with mrdanga and karatalas, but if somebody is expert instrument player, he can be admitted to join Sankirtana. We can accept everything for Krishna's service, but not taking the risk of diverting attention to any other thing which will hinder our Krishna Consciousness. That should be our motto, or principle.

Regarding your question about your sleep, you should sleep after noon prasadam, and when you are tired. You may take whatever foodstuffs you can digest easily. I do not think coconut will be easy for you to digest, but green vegetables you can take. So far as your missing Satsvarupa, it is natural to be attached to husband. But Satsvarupa is engaged in Krishna's service, and you are also engaged in Krishna's service. So both of you should feel happiness in Krishna's service always. When you get well, you can immediately join your husband.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
