====== Srutadeva ======

Catonsville, Maryland

My dear Srutadeva das:

Please accept my blessings. I have read this weeks newsletter, and I like it very much. You are doing very nice service. I have got all blessings upon you, and I am ordering all temples to send you regular news. You may send them a copy of this my letter.

You are a very nice boy, and you should be encouraged. It is very nice, and a great service to our cause. But, everyone should read it, otherwise what is the use?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
