My dear Pancadravida Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated December 18th and 20th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Sankirtana if it is not possible, never mind. Try to organize a meeting and impress upon the people Srimad-Bhagavatam philosophy by explaining. Manasvi can explain in Hindi and you can explain in English. This is also Sankirtana although not singing. So, where sankirtana is hampered, we can go on with kirtana and distributing magazines, that is more important than sankirtana. That is Brhat-mrdanga.

Getting registered we must. I may come there as soon as the Bombay business is finished. Regarding Mr. Sachdeva, instead of writing him, because I am unknown to him, I am thinking of going to talk with him directly.

Sankirtana within the Hindu community is prohibited? If it is very difficult to pull on there, then there is good field in Fiji.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
