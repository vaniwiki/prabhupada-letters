<card class="letter">
My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my greetings and hearty blessings. I hope in the meantime you have received my previous letter informing my safe arrival in New York.

Today I have received the certificates from India and the copies are enclosed herewith. Please immediately consult your Lawyer friend who wanted this certificates and do the needful. I must have now the Permanent visa otherwise I cannot go to Montreal and work will suffer very much if I do not go to Montreal by the next month. Kindly let me know what you have done in this connection and I shall wait your letter with interest.

I heard that for appointing a teacher-foreigner expert in particular subject one has to submit application with $25.00 fees and certificate of bona fides of the teacher sponsored by some American. The form I got from the office of Immigration is perhaps lying at San Francisco.

Anyway you wanted the certificate which is now obtained and now you can do the needful quickly and let me know what you have done. Please offer my blessings to all my devotees and specially Janaki Devi. Awaiting your early reply. I hope you are following the prescribed routine work for holding the classes and shall be glad to know about it.

Your ever well wisher.\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enclosure: Copy of the certificate.\\
N.B. I have not heard anything about the printing affair of Bhagavad-gita.
