My dear Hon Pei Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15th August, 1973, and I have noted the contents carefully.

There is no question of giving anything up in Krsna consciousness. That is the sum and substance of the Bhagavad-gita. Arjuna also thought like that "I shall not fight and fell silent" but Krsna did not approve of this sentimental attitude of the Great Arjuna. The whole Bhagavad-gita was spoken to Arjuna simply to convince him that he should work for the satisfaction of Krsna. Therefore Krsna plainly says, "Whatever you do as work, whatever you eat, or give away in charity, do it for Me." This is real Krsna consciousness, to work for the satisfaction of Krsna. So you have good opportunity to serve Krsna by your nice education, go on finish up in the university and simultaneously follow the regulative principles, chanting 16 rounds, and associate with the devotees as much as possible. Your talents can be utilized for Krsna and in due course of time how this is so Krsna will reveal to you more and more. So do not be worried, be jolly in the service of the Lord.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
