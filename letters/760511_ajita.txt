My dear Ajita das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 26, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning renaming your temple, if I have already given a name previously, then what is the need to re-name it. Now I can see that there is good preaching potential everywhere in your country as you mention the good response at the universities. Push on with these preaching activities and distribute my books profusely. They will someday realize how valuable books we have left them.

If you carry out your plan to hold Rathayatra, be certain that the Ratha-cart is very strongly made, so that it does not break during the procession. They had a very good cart made in Philadelphia and you can take hints from the devotees there how they designed their cart.

Upon your recommendation, I am accepting Lilamohana das and Kesava das for second initiation. Their threads are enclosed and you can play the gayatri mantra with accompanying mantra sheets into their right ear. Also, I am accepting Robert Hamilton (Sthayibhava das), and Joseph Hall (Mahamantra das) as my disciples. You can hold fire sacrifice and their beads may be chanted upon by Kirtanananda Swami. They must agree to strictly follow the regulative principles: no illicit sex-life, no intoxication, no gambling, and no meat-eating, and to chant minimum 16 rounds of japa daily. See that everyone is maintaining this standard of regulation so that there will be no hindrance to developing Krsna Consciousness.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
