====== Tamala Krsna ======

Dear Tamala Krsna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Recently Mr. Brijmohan Mohata, along with his wife, niece and other family members, came to see me at Mayapur. He is very much pleased with our movement. He has given me one idea to educate our men in Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati for preaching work in the interior part of Bombay. I think it a good suggestion. If you are really serious in this matter you can immediately engage some of our men to learn these different languages. He has already given us a place to stay and for this proposal he will continue his patronage. So try to execute this part of our propaganda immediately.

Another point is that some friends suggest here that because I am the chief man and signatory in the Sales agreement, and as I did not cancel the agreement with Nair, I have the right to revive.

Anyway, there is a suggestion by Syamasundara that I may go to London for meeting very important men there in the new house given us by George. Regarding your complaint that Syamasundara was canvassing some of our Indian workers to go to London, that I have already stopped. So there is no cause of anxiety in this regard. Finally, I want to make some definite settlement of Bombay affairs before I return to Europe or America. If there is a suitable place for me to stay for a few days in Bombay I can go there immediately and from there I may go to London. So far my health is concerned I think I am 80-90% fit to move so there is no cause of anxiety.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
