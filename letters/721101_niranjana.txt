====== Letter to: Niranjana ======

Saugor, India

My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 16, 1972, and I have noted the contents with care. You say that Saugar is a nice place and people are very much eager to see me there, therefore I shall be glad to go there. So you can set up the programme in consultation with Tamala Krishna Goswami, who is presently in Bombay centre. He is making up our Indian programme. I shall be remaining here in Vrindaban up to 16th November, and then we are going to Hyderabad, so I shall be very glad to see you again if you can come here before I leave Vrindaban.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Ref: Your second letter from Allahabad. It appears that you have been poisoned by some rascals. Such rascals cannot do anything to push on the mission of Lord Caitanya but can put hindrances in the path of spreading KC all over the world. I am very sorry that you have fallen a victim of such poisonous serpents. Because such easy going rascals are unable to assume the position of "Prabhupada" or unfit for the post, they are so envious and you are talking on their behalf. I am very sorry for this.\\
