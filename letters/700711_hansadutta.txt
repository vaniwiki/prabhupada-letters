====== Hansadutta ======

Hamburg

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1st July, 1970, and noted the contents carefully.

Regarding printing of French and German editions of BTG, Brahmananda has already made arrangement with Japan so for the time being you get the French and German editions printed in Japan.

Yes, I have received one letter from Srimati Himavati and I have replied also. So accident is accident; do not be worried, be careful in future. There is a common proverb in Sanskrit that when travelling one should avoid accompaniment of women---__pathe nari vivarjayet.__ So far her stay in the hospital is concerned, she has already written to me about this. It is good that you are carrying Prasadam to the hospital.

If you and Tamala both are present at the opening of a new center that will be nice. Or you you may follow your other plan, but however you do it, do it jointly by combined consultation. If you do it jointly in this way you will get strength to decide the right thing. Another thing is that before opening a branch we must have able men also to conduct, otherwise how we can open branches?

I have not heard from Tamala since a long time; Where he is now?*

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Neither I have heard anything how you have performed Rathayatra in London.\\
