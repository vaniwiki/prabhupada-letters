My dear Sukhada Devi Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th August, 1971 and I thank you very much for your kindly appreciations. Also I have received your generous check for $50 as daksina. You are such a sincere and intelligent girl and if you will just stick to our principles you are sure to make rapid advancement in this Krishna Consciousness. So work cooperatively with Satsvarupa and the others and help to make all of Boston city Krishna Conscious.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
