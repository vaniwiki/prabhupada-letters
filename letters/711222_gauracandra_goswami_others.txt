Dear sirs,

With reference to our conversation of the 27th November, 1971, I beg to inform you that when I visited India in 1967, our account was settled up until the month of August, 1967. Since then I have paid you as follows:

1) By hand not executed by you dated 26/8/67: Rs. 100/-.

2) By cash paid to Nripendra Babu on 18th May, 1967, as deposit money or advance payment on account of proposed leasehold land surrounding Sri Sri Radha Damodara Temple: Rs. 750/-.

3) On 27/11/71 I have paid you: Rs. 101/-.

TOTAL AMOUNT PAID: Rs. 951/-.

Now since September, 1967, up to November, 1971, even I don't charge any interest on the above-mentioned amount, and deducting your dues at Rs. 5/- per month for 51 months or Rs. 225/-, the balance due from you is Rs. 725/-. So kindly arrange to pay me this Rs. 725/- balance, along with interest.

Regarding management of Sri Sri Radha Damodara Temple, I beg to inform you that the two rooms and the entry veranda in front of the gate are sufficient for me alone, but because I have now thousands of disciples, it is natural that when I am there at least 25 to 50 students will live with me. So please give me facilities for living there with my disciples. I am prepared to pay a reasonable rent for this.

I can arrange for Radha Damodara Temple worship very nicely, namely at least 50 devotees will be offered prasadam daily, including two times refreshment and two meals. The disciples will remain with me. They will have daily chanting and reciting scriptures very nicely, which will attract hundreds of persons during the performances.\\
