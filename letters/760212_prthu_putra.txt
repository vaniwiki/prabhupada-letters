Vrndavana

Dear Prthu Putra Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 5/1/76 from Kanpur and I have noted the contents with pleasure. The private programs you held in homes in Allahabad were very nice. I would also like you to arrange a suitable place for us to have a tent at the Kumba Mela. We shall go there and have a nice festival.

Regarding the engagements in Kanpur on the 14th and 15th of February, you certainly have my blessings. Please hold a nice program there and invite all the audience to our Vrndavana temple. In fact, wherever you go you should invite people to our temples (Vrindaban).

Thank you very much for your kind sentiments.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
