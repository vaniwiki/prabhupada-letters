====== Aniruddha ======

My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated October 5, 1969 and October 7, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. As you were not fixed up in any place I could not reply. Now I understand from Brahmananda's letter that you have returned back to New York temple, so I am glad to hear this. Please note it carefully that you cannot leave Krishna Consciousness. That is a fact. And even if you want to leave, Krishna will not leave you. That is also a fact. Under the circumstances you should adjust your situation and continue Krishna Consciousness very enthusiastically. I know you are a very intelligent boy, industrious, so you can do tremendous service to Krishna by utilizing your inherent qualities. I am very glad you decided to marry and I quite approve of it. My married couple disciples are doing very nice service to Krishna Consciousness in Hawaii, Japan, London, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, etc. So you also get yourself married, and if you like you open a new branch, and husband and wife together advance the cause of Krishna Consciousness. Anyway, I recommend your married life very strongly. That will give you extra strength to serve Krishna. So do it as soon as possible. I think Brahmananda will help you in this matter and that will solve all your problems.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
