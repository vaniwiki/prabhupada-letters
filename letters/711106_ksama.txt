====== Ksama (Lynn Edwards) ======

My dear Ksama Devi Dasi (Lynn Edwards),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your your kind letter requesting initiation and, at the recommendation of Dhananjaya Prabhu, I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. I have given you the spiritual name Ksama Devi Dasi, Ksama means forgiveness. Your beads have also been duly chanted and they are enclosed herewith.

I can understand that you are a very sincere girl and that is the first qualification for developing love for Krishna. Now increase that sincerity more and more by engaging yourself whole-heartedly and with great enthusiasm for serving Krishna and very soon love of Godhead will fructify. You will become more and more happy in this life and in the end go back to home, back to Krishna, to enjoy eternal life, full of bliss and knowledge and in association with the supreme lovable object, Krishna. And our process for obtaining to such a wonderful existence is not at all difficult. Following the regulative principles strictly, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily and always think of Krishna. In this way mold your life and your future will be very bright.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
