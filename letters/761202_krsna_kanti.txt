====== Krsna Kanti ======

Los Angeles

My dear Krsna Kanti,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 23, 1976 along with the record album.

The music is nice for the nondevotee class of men. However, the picture on the album cover is not nice. Why this crazy picture? This will not help our cause. They will not be able to understand. They will think it is change of body, not of heart. We have got so many nice pictures of Krsna.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
