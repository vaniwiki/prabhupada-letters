====== Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one letter from one of our life members in Delhi, and I am enclosing his letter addressed to me, that you might straighten this matter out. Why he should not have been issued with a receipt for his contribution at least?

I have been informed by Ādi Kesava Maharaja that the people in Washington are prepared to approve our purchase of the Delhi house at 12 Ring Road, but they cannot do so until* they receive the application which we submitted in New Delhi. So much time has passed and still they have not received the original application in Washington from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. Please look into the matter and inform me in Hawaii where I shall most probably remain until the end of the month of May.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Did you take any receipt of the application to the office?
