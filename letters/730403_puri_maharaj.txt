====== Letter to: Puri Maharaj ======

ISKCON Los Angeles

Los Angeles, Calif. 90034

My dear Puri Maharaj,

Please accept my humble dandavats. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 25, 1973 and I have noted the contents with great interest. While in Mayapur I expected to see you. You would have been pleased to see the excellent building that we have constructed. People say it is a unique building in all of Nadia district. There is ample space for 300 gentlemen to come and visit. The proposal is to construct four such buildings and a big Temple two hundred and fifty feet high.

Regarding the house at Puri – the place of Srila Prabhupada – it is understood to be in implication in so many ways. I understand also that Sripad B.D. Madhav Maharaj is also eager to purchase, so I do not wish to make a competitive price. Now I have left India for 6 months and may return by October. If in the meantime some real developments take place you can write to me at my Los Angeles address which follows where I am returning via London and New York. The address is 3764 Watseka Avenue, Los Angeles, Calif. 90034 USA. I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
