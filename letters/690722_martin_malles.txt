====== Martin Malles ======

Dear Martin Malles,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter postdated July 17, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I am very pleased to note that you have been coming to our Krishna Consciousness temple in New York and what you are learning there from the disciples and from our literature is provoking you to think very deeply on the matters of self-realization. Actually, what the devotees there are telling you about the Hatha Yoga system is correct. In __Bhagavad-gita__ you will find confirmation of the fact that this Hatha Yoga system is not so easy process as you have been led to believe by various "masters". To do actual Hatha Yoga one must not live in the city, but he must go to a sacred spot, and completely freed from all attachments and all material desires and disturbances, he must concentrate his mind upon the Lord within his heart. This process is not completed in just six months time, but it extends over many, many lifetimes. So in this age of Kali Yuga it is not possible to faithfully follow the procedures of Hatha Yoga because our minds are too restless and our lives are very brief. Therefore, the Lord has descended upon this earth five hundred years ago as Lord Caitanya to encourage the process among all men of chanting the Holy Names of God, the Hare Krishna Mantra. This chanting will immediately captivate the hearts and minds of all sincere souls, and therefore it is the prime benediction for the most fallen souls of the age of Kali Yuga. If you will continue to come to our temple and associate with the devotees as much as possible, you will see practically how you are making very, very nice progress in spiritual advancement. Krishna Consciousness is not some invented process nor is it some brought to America in an altered form. Krishna Consciousness is the bona fide process of God-realization that has brought so many great saints and sages to the perfectional level of knowledge of God. Therefore I request you to scientifically and seriously follow the principles of Krishna Consciousness as they are recommended by Lord Krishna Himself in the __Bhagavad-gita__ and many other Vedic literatures, and I am sure you will come out successful. When you have questions you should consult with Brahmananda or the other devotees, and if you like you may ask your questions to me.

I hope this will find you will.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
