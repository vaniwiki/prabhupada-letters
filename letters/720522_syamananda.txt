====== Syamananda ======

Sydney

My dear Syamananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated in your very nice handwriting. Do not bother yourself for designing for Vrndavana Temple. The work has been taken up by one very qualified architect in Delhi and also Saurabha is assisting. So I can understand that you are very talented boy from your wonderful script, so I think you should apply your talent for painting nice pictures of Krishna and the acaryas in our line, and also you may help Mohadananda in designing work for his press operation there in Sydney.

Now I understand that Madhudvisa Swami is there with you in Sydney so you may give him all assistance also. He can give you good direction how to best employ yourself in the service of the Lord. And if you get opportunity for sometimes travelling with him for doing Sankirtana all over Australia that will also be nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
