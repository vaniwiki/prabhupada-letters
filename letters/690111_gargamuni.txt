====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 1, 1969 and it is very gratifying to know that Krishna has again engaged you in your own business. When you went to your father sometimes I was thinking whether I have not spoiled the career of this boy, but still I wanted to give your father a chance so he would not think that two of his boys are lost in the Krishna Consciousness movement. So it was Krishna's dictation that you went to your father for full cooperation, but he did not respond. Now you are free. I think that the talent which you have got for doing business will help our cause more than what you could have done at the custody of your father.

So I am very glad that now you have a nice store in the new temple and that things are going on fittingly. I have got a report from Purusottama that his mother has seen your store and has very much appreciated it. Your presence was very badly needed at the temple to help your brother because Purusottama is here with me, so always do your best for the service of the Lord and be happy.

So far as your selling incense is concerned, you may be interested to know that I have got connection with one big firm in Bangalore. (The firm is Sri Saibaba Perfumery Works, No. 40, 1st Cross, VI Main Road, Chamarajapet, BANGALORE-18, INDIA.) I have asked this party to send me samples and quotations, and we shall see whether they are favorable to others.

It is very encouraging to note that you are receiving nice appreciations for the __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ and I have seen the two reviews which were sent by Brahmananda. They also appear to be nice, although one is not very favorable. However, this unfavorable review also proclaims that our __Bhagavad-gita__ is distinct from all others. This point we want to advertise.

Thank you very much for the sandalwood and sweetpea oils that you have sent me. I was just thinking of these oils because my stock was just finished, and Krishna has sent it just in time through you. Please ask Brahmananda to send to me a list of the Gaudiya Math books which will be arriving in February, so I will then direct as to what shall be done with these books so far as distribution. Also, please keep me posted as to the progress with Dai Nippon.

I am enclosing a typed copy of lecture which I recorded and which was played in London on January 4th during a very successful meeting they were holding there with many important guests. Please hand over this enclosed copy to Rayarama to be printed in __Back To Godhead.__ I am also enclosing a resolution announcing the passing away of one of my god-brothers and which also should be printed in __Back To Godhead.__

Please convey my blessings to the other devotees. I hope that you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: Please convey my appreciation to Patita Uddharana for his nice letter of January 1, 1969, and for his poem which he has sent to me via Rayarama. I have very much appreciated his poetic skills which he has shown in writing this poem, and thus I have requested Rayarama to print it in __Back To Godhead__ as soon as possible. Encourage Patita Uddharana to compose more of such poetries. He is a good boy, and I am pleased that he is doing so nicely.
