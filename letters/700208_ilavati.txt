====== Ilavati ======

London

My dear Daughter Ilavati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice letter dated 28 January, 1970, along with your beads. I am very happy to accept you as one of my disciples, and I am returning your beads herewith duly chanted on by me.

As you are liking the London Temple atmosphere, please remain there to learn more about Krishna Consciousness from your Godbrothers and Godsisters there. Follow the rules and regulations and avoid the ten offenses in chanting the Holy Name, study the Scriptures like __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ and always stay engaged in Krishna's service. I am enclosing a list of rules for devotees and the ten offenses. Chant regularly sixteen rounds daily on your beads and be happy.

Ilavati is the name of the Goddess of the Earth. Do not forget Krishna, He will give you all protection, and your life will be sublime.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
