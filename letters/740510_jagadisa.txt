====== Letter to: Jagadisa ======

Evanston, Illinois

My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 26, 1974 and noted the contents. I can appreciate that you are traveling widely in your recently expanded zone and you plan to first become acquainted with the temple presidents by traveling is good. As far as you leaving Uttama Sloka in charge of Toronto and sending Sripati to Montreal, that is alright. I know Sripati was already there in Montreal and he is experienced.

Regarding your Gurukula report, why are the older boys being sent to New Vrindaban? What are the facilities like, what is the program there, what is the need for them to move? As things are not fully explained in your letter, I am inquiring regarding this very important change. As for buying a new house and land in order that the pre-school children may go there, what is the need of them being separate. If they cannot rise early, why should you take care of such young ones at Gurukula. But if they are rising early and attending arati, then why must they be separate from the other little children? Please explain further. You are right when you say Deity worship must be maintained. This is most important. I know Nandarani is expert in Deity care but I think she is working with the children. Your wife is also expert, so she can maintain the sewing and Deity worship program. But the standard must always be kept up. Sankirtana is also a part of Vaisnavism. All our activities are a part of Vaisnavism. So Sankirtana should also be developed at Dallas.

Yes, I have heard myself about Winipeg, that it is a big city in Canada. So if you think it better to move Regina center there that is approved by me. Yes, you plan to keep headquarters 1/2 year in Chicago and 1/2 year in Dallas, that is approved by me. Please send regular reports.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
