====== All Temple Presidents ======

Temple Presidents\\
All ISKCON Centers

My dear temple president,

Please accept my blessings. This letter is to inform you that Hari das Brahmacari has received permission to go to all of our centers in the west for visiting and gaining the experience of preaching there. He is from Bengal and he can cook nicely, go out on sankirtana, lead kirtanas, classes, as well as teach Bengali bhajans. Please give him all facility to engage in these ways while he is staying at your temple. He will be returning to India for the Mayapur festival in March, 1975.

I hope this meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
