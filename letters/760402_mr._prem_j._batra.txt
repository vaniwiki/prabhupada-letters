My dear Mr. Batra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 27, 1976 with enclosed article. Concerning your questions raised, the process is simply to hear from authority and accept it. From the Bhagavad-gita we can understand Krishna because He is explaining Himself. What is the difficulty to understand. There is somebody Superior in all aspects of material activities. The sun rises exactly on time, the seasons changing, fruits appearing, and flowers. There is no change in the law of nature. Don't you think that there is a Superior Being managing these things. Why not accept this proposal. It is no explanation that it is simply accident that all these things are going on so nicely. "Mayadhaksena prakrti suyatte sacara caram . . . This material world is working under my direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again." [[books:bg:9:10|(Bg. 9.10)]].

Reasoning is there if you simply explain that Krishna is full in 6 opulences: strength, knowledge, wealth, beauty, fame, and renunciation. No one can excel Krishna in opulence. Nobody is equal to or greater than Krishna, therefore He is God.

The word for philosophy is tattva darsana---the Bhagavad-gita recommends that one approach a spiritual master who is tattva darsana, one who has seen the truth. This is philosophy.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
