====== Letter to: Gurudasa ======

Los Angeles

My dear Guru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 31st, 1974 and have noted the contents. By Krishna's grace, you are very much engaged there. It is very encouraging. I will be going to Hawaii on Jan. 24th via Hong Kong and Tokyo, arriving in Honolulu about the 29th. If you like, you can see me there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
