====== Gurudasa ======

Calcutta

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. Yes, I received your Vyasa Puja offerings and the booklet was so nice. Thank you very much.

It is very encouraging that you are getting prominent men of Calcutta to sign the invitation to Indira Gandhi. In the meantime I have induced the high commissioner in London to request her in the same way. So try to induce Indira Gandhi your best to attend the cornerstone ceremony.

Why Acyutananda Swami should go to Delhi? He is supposed to be in charge of Mayapur affairs. Besides that he is purchasing some 10,000 bricks for constructing toilet rooms. He is supposed to remain in Mayapur and nowhere else. I have already written him in this connection. Rather Tamala should go with you. I have written Tamala also in this connection. So if you are not already started for Delhi, then make this alteration. Tamala should go for some time, not Acyutananda, to see to organizing Delhi center.

Hansadutta is in Hamburg and Syamasundara is here with me in London. So far that money from Bangladesh program, I have no definite information. But don't be in a dream about it. Be practical and depend on Krishna.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
