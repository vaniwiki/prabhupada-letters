Spanga, Sweden

My dear Ajita dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 16/11/74 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I accept Dvarakesa das Brahmacari for second initiation as twice born brahmana. Enclosed is the sacred thread duly sanctified by me, and the mantra sheet. Now hold a fire sacrifice and he may hear the gayatri mantra through the right ear from my tape recording. The mantra must be recited three times daily.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
