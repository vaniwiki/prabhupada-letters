====== Letter to: Ramesvara ======

My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 17/10/76.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept the following devotees for first initiation and also those whom yo have recommended for second initiation. Hold a fire ceremony. Instruct the new initiates to strictly follow the regulative principles and chant minimum 16 rounds daily avoiding the 10 offenses. Allow the second initiates to hear the tape of me chanting the gayatri mantra. You may chant on the beads.
