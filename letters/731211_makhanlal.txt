====== Makhanlal ======

My dear Makhanlal,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 4, 1973. Regarding the $100.00 check, send a copy of the cancelled check, both sides, to Karandhara for examination.

I accept the following devotees as my duly initiated disciples:

Chuck---Caturatma das

Allen---Anirdesya-vapu das

Robert---Pranada das

Dean---Prana das

Joanne---Keli-Cancala dasi

Nancy---Vidamba dasi

I am returning their beads by separate post. See always to their welfare in Krsna Consciousness.

The conch shell is place on the altar and used for blowing. It is pleasing to the Deity and a bona fide item of worship. Never mind all the rumors you have heard.

Yes, if you are able to acquire some farm land and produce grains that will be nice. Especially we want to export grains to India. Do not, however, change or disrupt the existing Temple program. The economic situation is always precarious but we are dependent on Krsna only.

Thank you very much for your endeavors in book distribution and please offer your good wife my blessings for her service in this connection. Our preaching work will be measured by the quantity of books we distribute so continue ever-increasingly.

Take care that devotees do not become sick. They should always be properly clothed and fed.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
