====== Jayapataka ======

Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have not received reply to my letter sent to you on the 24th instant. Why are you silent? Also, has Dinanath arrived there from Gorakhpur with the Deities? I instructed Dr. Rao (Ramananda) that if a land agreement hadn't been settled up on the University of Gorakhpur by the 22nd instant that Dinanath should go to Calcutta immediately with the Deities, but as of yet I have received no reply from Gorakhpur.

Enclosed please find one set of japa mala, as a sample. I want to purchase similar style beads, as good, if not better, quality and in large numbers. These beads are available in Calcutta and especially in Navadvipa they have got the best quality beads. So please send cost quotation, at lowest price, for 100 sets first quality beads and I will let you know how many I want ordered. Please take care of this matter as soon as possible since I will be leaving Bombay after 5th April.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Beads coming separate post.\\
