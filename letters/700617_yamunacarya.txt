====== Yamunacarya ======

New Vrndavana

My dear Yamunacarya,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated nil.

You write to say how you were saved from a commitment of suicide. So you have seen the mantra in Isopanisad:

> ye ke catma-hano janah

So not only you, but almost all the conditioned souls within this material world, practically 99% of the whole population is committing suicide. As it is natural for a gentleman to try to stop a person committing suicide when it so happens just in one's presence, similarly when we see that so many men and women are simply committing suicide as described in the Isopanisad __ye ke catma-hano janah,__ let us try to save them through this Krsna Consciousness Movement.

I am very glad that you are going with Kirtanananda Maharaja to colleges. So try to understand the philosophy* nicely and spread it to your best capacity so that these suiciding men can be saved as far as possible. It is not, however, possible to check the suiciding policy of the modern society, but my Guru Maharaja used to say that if he could save one person then He would consider His mission successful. Similarly, if we individually could save at least one person, many of the suiciding men can be saved.

So do your best and Krsna will give you necessary intelligence and help, and try to push on this Movement as far as possible.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
