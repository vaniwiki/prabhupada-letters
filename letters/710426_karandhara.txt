My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 19th April, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far as recording record albums is concerned, I can go there by the end of May, at the present I am going to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on the 30th April and then I shall be going to Calcutta via Sydney, Australia by the 14th May. They are having one Hare Krishna Festival similar to the one just held in Bombay up until the 24th May. So at that time if Mr. Duffy is still offering, then he should send me tickets for three men and I shall go there. In the mean time I shall try and send some tapes.

Your idea for selling advertisements for Rathayatra issue of BTG is very good. This idea we have implemented both in Bombay and Calcutta and it has proven very good for collecting money. In Calcutta they are collecting at a rate of Rs 5000/- per day.

The book distribution report is very encouraging. If you can find out two or three such distributers throughout the nation, then we can distribute 10,000 books very easily. Now 5,000 KRSNA, vol. II and 10,000 KRSNA vol. I clear stock you have got. Altogether 15,000 @ $8.00 per copy less 40%, or $4.80 x 15,000 = $72,000.00 clear cut which should be sent gradually to the Bhaktivedanta Book Fund and again reprint. So we shall overflood the whole of Europe and America with KRSNA book.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. So far as sending money to my book fund for the Dai Nippon debt as advised in my previous letter, henceforward $3000.00 should be sent only. The next installment of paying my book fund should be paid to my Bank of America checking account __#3081-61625__ until further instruction to you. Your reply to Dai Nippon was very correct. I do not like their policy of intermingling Bhaktivedanta Book Fund deposit with BTG account. I am awaiting their further reply in this connection. Then I shall advise you to send directly to the book fund.

In reply to your letter dated 19th April, I shall be glad to initiate those whose names have been given. Just as soon as I secure the beads, they will be duly chanted on and dispatched. The check for $60.00 to cover the cost of 12 sets beads is in hand. ACB\\
