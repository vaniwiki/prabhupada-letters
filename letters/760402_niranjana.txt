====== Letter to: Niranjana ======

My dear Niranjana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 16th March, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. Concerning your translating into Hindi, you had translated some small books into Hindi, where are they? Please send them to Bombay address. Also, you can write small articles for the Hindi magazine here, "Bhagavata Darsana." Also, translate more small books into Hindi and send them to Bombay.

There was one Hindi translation of "Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu" which I saw, I do not know the name of it. It was published in Benares and I saw it at one friend's house. One of my Godbrothers attempted also to translate the same into Hindi with Sanskrit slokas but he only completed a few pages. If you like his address is Sridhara Maharaja, P.O. Navadvipa, Dist. Nadia, W. Bengal.

Your program of visiting the local Hindu temple and giving discourse on our philosophy is nice. Try to follow the four regulative principles and chant 16 rounds daily and you will gradually make progress in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope that this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
