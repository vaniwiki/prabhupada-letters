====== M. M. De ======

Calcutta

My dear M.M. De,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12/11/76.

Thanks for your determination. Why not act as liaison, agent, and representative of Krsna following in the footsteps of your father? Your father didn't despise the service of Krsna; because service of Krsna is eternal engagement of the living entity. Practically, your father's books sell all over the world to the extent of Rs. 5 to 6 lacs per day. If he would have taken the royalty to the minimum of 15% his daily income would have been Rs. 75,000/- per day. But he does not take a single paise and is engaged as representative of Krsna day and night. Why not follow this tradition of your noble heritage?

Hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. At Bhuvaneśvara (Orissa) I want to construct a __Jagannatha temple__ exactly like that in Puri. If you like you can do the full charge to do this job. I shall spend as much money as it is required to do it nicely. ACBS\\
