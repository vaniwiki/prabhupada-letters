My dear Batu Gopala,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 24, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I have turned the matter of your temple management over to Sriman Bhagavan Das in Paris, as he has some knowledge of the situation there. All these questions should be directed to the GBC members, as my desire is to simply translate, and leave the management matters for them to decide. Anyway, you can correspond with him in this matter, and he can advise you.

Upon your recommendation, I have gladly consented to accept Elaine as my duly initiated disciple, and to give sacred thread to Audolomy. Enclosed please find one letter to Elaine, and one sacred thread for Audolomy. Her beads are being sent by separate post. Now you can hold a fire yajna for both of them, and give gayatri mantra to Audolomy. Show him to count on the finger divisions, and have him listen to the tape of me reciting gayatri mantra, repeating each vibration as I say it. You can get this tape from Bali Mardan Goswami in New York. Then hang the sacred thread over his shoulder in the proper fashion. One thing is that the tape should be heard through earphones into the right ear, and the function should be held amongst the devotees only.

Hoping this will meet you in good health. Please offer my blessings to all the others there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
