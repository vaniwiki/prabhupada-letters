====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12/10/76.

Cyavana has misspent, that is clear. Therefore, indirectly we are responsible because we could not control him. Slack management Arrange things so that in the future these things may not occur.

Whether we require our own house in Mombassa? Why spend energy in that way when there is no money? Preaching is first and foremost. If by preaching people will contribute, then we can get, otherwise, what is the need?

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
