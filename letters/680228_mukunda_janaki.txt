====== Mukunda, Janaki ======

San Francisco

Dear Mukunda and Janaki,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letters of Feb. 24 and 25, 1968, and I have noted the contents. Yes, if you can find out some distributing agent for our Back to Godhead, that is very good. Please do it. I have received both dictaphone machines, and the new one is working nicely. The foreign one I have yet to test at some shop, which I will do this week. I have written in Uddhava's letter that I shall be arriving on March 8th, and we can discuss the meeting at the Immigration Bureau at that time.

I thank you very much for that nice sketch done by Janaki, and I shall have Jadurani begin a painting from that pose. So far the spirit soul is concerned, if conditions are for some reason not favorable in some place, he is forced to leave that womb and take shelter in another. And if there is chanting of Hare Krishna, even the soul is there for a short time, oh, he will hear and become advanced. This sound vibration is not material, it is spiritual, and powerful beyond our conception. So it cannot be hindered in any way by something material; it surpasses all these material barriers. So you can know it that when you are chanting, you are also giving benefit to even the child in the womb. I hope you are feeling much healthier by this time, and I shall be very glad to see you when I arrive in San Francisco. Hope you are both well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please hand over the enclosed letter to Uddhava & Cidananda.
