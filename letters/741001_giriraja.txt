My dear Giriraja Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 26, 1974 with enclosed draft of your article. Regarding the Tax Commission Notice, I understand from Mr. Sethi that at time land in the vicinity of his house was selling for Rs. 60/-, so we have not paid less. The most important point is that Mr. Nair wanted to give us the land at a concessional rate because we are a charitable institution. I have already sent under separate post (Registered), the photocopy of a land donated to us in Orissa, Bhuvaneśvara, and I have asked Mahamsa Swami to also send the photocopy of his gift deed. So we get so many donations of land, due to the charitable nature of our organization.

Regarding the tax exemption for research, we are doing actual research of the Vedic literatures. In this connection you can give the quotations from the many professors in America regarding how they are receiving my books which are heretofore unknown and unavailable to Western readers. Furthermore we are doing active research. We are demonstrating how people can live peacefully and simply, according to the correct civilization. Our ideas are not man-made imperfect ideas, but perfect scientific conclusions. In addition I have a number of Doctorate students in various fields of science, Dr. Svarupa Damodara, Dr. Wolf-Rottkay, Dr. Rao, and others. They can act as the Heads of the research. We are presenting ideal living on Vedic principles of purified life of no illicit sex, no meat eating, gambling or intoxication.

Regarding Manasvi's going abroad, one department that is very important is the tenant and rent department. There are some tenants who are occupying but they are not the original tenants. We must be very careful that in our presesnce the original tenant may not be replaced with someone else.

Regarding increasing the Life Membership fee, that you will have to adjust amongst yourselves. Yes, you can move my things into the new quarters.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am returning the draft with corrections and additions as per enclosed. I have just received notice from Hansadutta that he has sent Dollars 4,000 to Central Account for Food Relief. That money may be immediately transferred to Gargamuni Swami Calcutta account for use on construction of the Prasadam Distribution Pavillion.\\
