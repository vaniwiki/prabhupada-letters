====== Hayagriva ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 29, 1969 and noted the contents. Things are going on nicely in every department, and it is very encouraging. But as I have already told you, your first business is to see about the publication of my books. I have already advised Satsvarupa and Brahmananda in this connection, and they will take the necessary care for it. I want to know if __Nectar of Devotion__ is coming along at proper pace. So you will kindly manage in Columbus that the printing matters are substantially ready for the press. The press may not sit idly for want of printing matter. Then it will be very nice from all sides. Pradyumna is in charge of making the diacritic marks nicely, so I shall be glad to know if he is doing that work according to plan. Recently I received one letter from Arundhati that she wants to work very hard. So Syama Dasi should also do this as it was previously programmed. The main point is that the press should not sit down for want of printing matter. That you will kindly manage.

As you write that you cannot find suitable work in Boston, you stick to Columbus and give sufficient time to your editing work. Please also take care of the children. They are our future hopes, and the adolescent age is the most dangerous age. It is the turning point of one's life. In this age, if you take care of the children, surely they will come out first class Krishna Conscious devotees.

Regarding publishing articles from the __Harmonist,__ after the departure of my Guru Maharaja so many nonsense things have been written. So we should know who has written these articles. Articles written by my Guru Maharaja can be published without any hesitation, but articles written by Prof. Sannyal after 1936, they are not at all good.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
