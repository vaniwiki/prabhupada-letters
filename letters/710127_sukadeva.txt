My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear that you have now opened a center in Tucson, Arizona. It has been my desire to open 108 branches of our society all over the world and due to the sincere efforts of devotees such as your good self, it is actually happening. If you simply follow the regulative principles strictly, always chant Hare Krishna and just depend on Krishna, then all facility will be given to you to make Tucson temple a grand success by the grace of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

So far as Deity worship is concerned, for the present you can have a Guru-Gauranga altar and later on when there are more devotees there and you have facility, Lord Jagannatha or Radha Krishna Deity may be installed. Only initiated devotees may tend the Deity or cook for Him, so for the present you can set up a very attractive Guru-Gauranga altar and that will be very nice.

It is encouraging to hear that already you are distributing BTG so nicely, so continue in this way. Also you should widely distribute our books, especially to the schools and libraries. We have also initiated a life membership program for distributing our books and you can inquire about this program from Karandhara. I have noted how you already have been invited into peoples homes for Sankirtana program. Such engagements are ideal for making life members and distributing our literature. That has been our program in India and it has been very successful. So continue this program.

Yes, you have my blessings always. You are very sincere boy. Without being sincere nobody can make advancement. Please offer my blessings also to Sriman Elliot Prabhu and Sriman Pat (Balarama) Prabhu. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
