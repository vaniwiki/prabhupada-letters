====== Letter to: Nandarani ======

Dallas

My dear Nandarani,

Please accept my blessings. I have seen this special Rathayatra issue of "Back to Godhead" written by you, and I am so much pleased that so intelligently you have assorted the matter to completely understand our philosophy in a nutshell. I know that you are very intelligent and educated girl, so fully kindly utilize it for developing the Dallas institution for the benefit of your so many children. Or if your husband will accept the post as President of San Francisco center, you may accompany him there and assist him in every respect.

You can consult me freely whenever you like and I shall try to enlighten you as far as possible. But I am certain you are intelligent enough and I have already given you some hints on the basis of which you can do the needful.

Your husband has gone back from London, being completely overcome by family separation. So there is no need of living separately. Both of you husband and wife live together and render the best service to the Lord. We have never discouraged family life, so both of you are intelligent and can make your plan. Keep your situation fit for rendering service to the Lord more enthusiastically. That is my desire.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
