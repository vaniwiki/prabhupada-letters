====== Subala ======

Calcutta

My dear Subala das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22nd May, 1972, from Patna informing me that your health is strong and that you are carrying on with determination this preaching work. I have heard from others that you are doing very nicely, and that you are making life members also. That is very good news to me. I am making many Sannyasis here in America, and I am convinced that our movement must run on this extensive traveling and preaching system. So you work cooperatively with Giriraja, Bhavananda, Guru das, and all of the others there in India, how to perform this valuable service in the best way by utilizing all our men and time very wisely. Push on vigorously, especially in the matter of distributing our literatures widely throughout India and showing always a good example of real Krishna Consciousness way of life.

Hoping this will meet you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
