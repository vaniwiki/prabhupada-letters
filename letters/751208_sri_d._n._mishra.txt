Calcutta---6

My dear Dina Natha,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6 December 1975 and noted the contents. I am coming to Calcutta by beginning of February when I shall see to the matter personally.

I had been to Kuruksetra with the idea of constructing a temple, the negotiations are going on with the late home minister G.L. Nanda. So far my injuries are concerned, by the grace of Krishna and good wishes of friends and relatives it is already completely cured. Thank you very much for your kind inquiries.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
