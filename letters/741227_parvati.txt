My dear Parvati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 21, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully.

Thank you very much for trying so hard so many times to send me milk sweets, like sandesh, etc. Unfortunately this last time they went bad on the way here, therefore they were not in offerable condition. The fact that you have offered them to me is what counts. Not so much whether I have personally eaten them or not. So thank you for your sincere efforts in pleasing me. Under all circumstances you must remain in the association of devotees. Do not let yourself fall out of this association. Even if it is very difficult and there may be many problems or disagreements still simply by remaining in the association of devotees and follow our regulative principles, chanting 16 rounds, rising early etc., you will become purified. If you leave the association of devotees to follow these regulative principles will be very difficult. Therefore stay in the association of devotees and continue making nice milk preparations for the Deities. And when I come there this spring I will be glad to accept them three times a day.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
