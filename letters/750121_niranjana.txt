My dear Niranjana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 9th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for translating my books. It is so much important to me to have my books printed in all languages of the world. But, why are you sending the work to Ksirodakasayi for publication. I would rather have you send them to Bombay. You can send them to Yasomatinandana das adhikari here in Bombay. He can do the final editing as well as see to it that they are printed nicely. For the translation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, you can say either Paramesvara or Bhagavan. Paramatma or Antaryami is good for localized Super-soul. If you can give the meaning of all the sanskrit words, that will be best.

I am glad to hear things are going nicely in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
