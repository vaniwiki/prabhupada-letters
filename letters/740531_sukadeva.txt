My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of April 16, 1974.

I am glad to accept the devotees recommended by you for first initiation, and their new spiritual names are as follows:

1. Jerry S. Macdougal---Jalakara dasa

2. Michael Askvig---Manusuta dasa

3. Allen Conticchio---Anagha dasa

4. Deborah Conticchio---Dhanasri dasi

Now take good care of these devotees so that they they remain always enthusiastically engaged in chanting, hearing, reading our books and following the regulative principles.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
