====== Jadurani ======

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of March 10, 1969. And I am glad to learn that you are feeling somewhat healthier. Now you have requested to begin working, but I think you shall just suspend your activities at least for one month more. By that time I shall be in Boston, and I shall examine you personally then I shall do the needful. In the meantime, you can sit down silently, and increase your number of chanting. That is your work for the time being. And now as you have Deity in the temple you can rise very early in the morning for Mangala arati. I hope you are following all the Deity worship rulings. That is necessary.

I am happy to hear that you are all appreciating the new record album "Govinda", and I have good hopes of it selling nicely to so many American and European people.

I hope you are feeling stronger day by day, and please convey my blessings to all your God-brothers and God-sisters there with you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
