====== Vamanadeva ======

My dear Vamanadeva Das Adhikari:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your offering of $20.00 and thank you very much. I understand that you are now in London for helping to make our new place there a nice temple. So I will be very pleased if you make this English house into first class temple for Lord Krishna. London is very important center, so you do the work nicely.

I hope this meets you in good health and also your good wife and child.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
