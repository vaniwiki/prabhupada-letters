====== Tamala Krsna ======

Dear Tamala Krsna Goswami,

Please accept my blessings. After stopping in London and New York, we have now safely arrived in Los Angeles.

I am anxious to know if there has been any response from the Home Minister of India to the letter I wrote him while I was in New Delhi regarding the Indian Government assisting us in the development of our Juhu Beach Project. Our idea is to construct a hotel for American and European tourists to come and learn about factual spiritual life. While they are coming, there will be foreign exchange and the Indian Government is very much in favor of this. In this way, if we can convince them to help us by granting permanent visas for 100 to 150 of our men it will be a solution to our visa problems. Also, why not solicit a loan from the Government for 2 crores for developing our Juhu Beach Tourist Hotel. We will repay them in foreign exchange. You can point out that we have already invested up to 20 lakhs in foreign exchange so our projects in India are advantageous to the Indian economic development. This is the key to Governmental support in India.

Emphasize these points in all dealings with the Government. Please let me hear from you the developments and current news of our India projects.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
