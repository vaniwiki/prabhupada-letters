====== Gopala Krsna ======

Bombay

My dear Gopala Krsna das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated May 9, and May 16, 1976, as well as one telegram from Bombay that the Russians are appreciating our books. In that telegram you mentioned that the "mantra books" arrived. What "mantra books" are those that the Russians have ordered?

Concerning the prices of the Srimad-Bhagavatam at Rs. 13/-, is this the printer's price to us, or our price to the temples? And concerning the price of the Bhagavad-gita that Thompson Press is giving, is that for a soft or hardbound edition? We will have to see what is the price if printed in America or Japan. In America, they are selling the Abridged edition (paperback) for $1.95, to the bookstores.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
