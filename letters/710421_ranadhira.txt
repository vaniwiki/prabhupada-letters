My dear Ranadhira,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22nd January, 1971 and also Spiritual Sky incense and oil samples. For some reason I haven't received your package until just now, and I have not received your two previous letters either, otherwise I would have replied them immediately. I am travelling so much and too often my mail is misdirected. So don't feel sorry that I have not replied your letters. There is no cause of feeling so forelorn. As long as we are chanting Hare Krishna Mantra we are always under Krishna's protection. And you have committed no offenses. Even if there were some, they are all excused. Just like the mother who does not take the kicking of her child very seriously, so all these so called offenses are readily excused by me.

The incense and oil samples enclosed are very nice, and I am burning the incense in my room daily. These scents are so nice. But one thing is that you needn't spend $10,000 for machinery to package the incense. That is not required. Do not depend on machines. We are not going to be large-scale businessmen. Incense distribution is proving to be very important asset for raising funds for temple upkeep, etc., but we are more interested still in distributing our books. Incense sales are clearly business only, but when we sell our books that means we push forward our movement. Of course they can both be done together. That is nice program and has proven successful in many centers.

Presently I am in Bombay where preaching work is going on very successfully. Soon I shall be going to Russia also. We have got an invitation from one professor at the University of Moscow to speak there, so it is a good opportunity for spreading Krishna Consciousness. From there I may be going to Malaysia and Australia also, so my return to U.S.A. will be somewhat delayed.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
