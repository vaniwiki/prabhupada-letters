My dear Sons,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Aksojananda I am very glad to consent to accept both of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads are duly chanted by me and are enclosed herewith. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Brian Peverill/BRHATBHANU DAS BRAHMACHARY

Jean Luc Norroy/JAGADADIJA DAS BRAHMACHARY

Now my request to both of you is that you very seriously stick to the regulative principles of devotional service, and especially observe rigidly the four restrictions, and without fail always chant 16 rounds on your beads daily, and be happy.

You have got now the golden opportunity of this human form of life, and it is no accident that you have got now your spiritual master, now the rest is up to you. And if you stick tightly to the orders of your spiritual master, always trying to please him only, then very quickly you will achieve the supreme goal of your life. But maya is very strong. Therefore if you want to make progress in kicking out maya from your life, then keep yourselves always 24 hours engaged in the business of Krishna Consciousness, and help me to push on this Krishna Consciousness movement all over the world, utilizing your energy for that however you are best able, and then you will be freed from all attachment to maya, by Krishna's grace. And always remember to chant Hare Krishna, and that will save you in all circumstances, without any doubt.

Hoping this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
