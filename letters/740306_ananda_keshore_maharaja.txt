====== Letter to: Ananda Keshore Maharaja ======

Vrindaban

Dear Ananda Keshore Maharaja,

Please accept my greetings. Your letter dated February 28th, reached me very late, on the 5th of February. So I am sorry I couldn't join you. Thank you for your invitation. I am expecting to go back to Vrndavana in the second week of March. I will be very pleased to see you there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
