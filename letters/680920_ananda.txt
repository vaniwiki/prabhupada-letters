====== Ananda ======

My dear Ananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Sept. 10, 1968, and I have noted the contents carefully. I think your program is very nice, and Anapurna is here. We had a good talk yesterday, and it is understood that her parents are agreeable in this marriage proposal, and she wishes that the marriage may take place in London, when she goes there. It is understood also that her father is impressed with our society's work and her mother especially liked all the members of our society who have gone in London. So you work very diligently and secure some money. I am coming to Seattle by tomorrow evening and if you can see me at Seattle it will be very nice. You can also inform Mr. Renovich and Mr. Windisch that I am going to Seattle by tomorrow, and they can correspond with me for my visiting Vancouver and attending lectures, so that I can make my program there and come to Vancouver for a few days. Hope you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
