My dear Mr. Dennany,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 28th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for reading and appreciating my books. Please continue to do so as much as possible and visit our temple in Miami frequently. You mentioned in your letter that you had read many other Bhagavad-gitas before you read mine and that none of them revealed as much to you as Bhagavad-gita As It Is. The reason is because we do not change the actual meaning of the gita at all. Many other commentators due to poor fund of knowledge tamper with the lines of Bhagavad-gita and twist the meaning for their personal motives, but we do not do like that. We present it exactly as it is; without any additions or subtractions. That is perfect in every way and therefore it is actually having a tremendous effect all over the world. The original words of Lord Krishna have unrivalled potency and anyone who is fortunate enough to hear those words and tries to apply them to his life becomes perfect.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
