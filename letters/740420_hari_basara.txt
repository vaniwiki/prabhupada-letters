<card class="letter">
Spokane, Washington

Dear Hari basara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 7, 1974 along with other letters and literature regarding the World's Fair exposition in Spokane, Washington.

According to your letter you suggest I come and speak in the middle of August. But in order to insure good attendance at the event in order to sell the tickets and make profit you think it best if I appear with a popular music group. These arrangements make us too dependent on other parties. We should not be dependent on others but should present our own program. Since there are so many conditions and risks involved, better you yourselves do as much as possible to spread Krsna Consciousness there by distribution of literature, kirtana and prasadam, and that will be as effective as my personally coming. Besides, I must be in Vrindaban for Janmastami so my schedule makes it difficult for me to be in Spokane, Washington.

I am very keen on the distribution of my books and I am very indebted to all of you for your untiring efforts to see that every man and woman in America get one of my books. If they simply read one page, even if they do nothing else, they can become perfect. I have read the plans of Ramesvara and Tripurari to attend the fair and distribute to the thousands of people who are coming; whatever transcendental tactics you leaders think best for distributing the books you can employ. Please keep me informed of your progress as the Fair develops.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
