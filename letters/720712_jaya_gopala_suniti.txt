====== Jaya Gopala, Suniti ======

Los Angeles

My dear Jaya Gopala and Suniti,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram dated July 9, 1972 and I have noted the contents with great concern. I am very much anxious to know what is your condition, and how you are recovering. Please let me know at your earliest convenience. In this material world, at every step there is danger, so we must become very diligent in executing spiritual life, and not neglect even a moment.

Hoping this will meet you good spirits and increasing good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
