====== Jayasri ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jayasri,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letters dated October 14, 1969 and November 5, 1969. You are such a sincere devotee that Krishna has helped you to understand the philosophy so quickly. And this sincerity of purpose is the only means to attain perfection in Krishna Consciousness. I am so glad to learn that you are thinking of sleep as a waste of time. This is not an ordinary thing. So I have become very much pleased to hear this statement from you. Be blessed by Krishna. Just as you have already understood the benefits of this Krishna Consciousness Movement, try to realize and assimilate it more and more and distribute it to the suffering humanity. Our movement is the greatest gift to the human race. They may not immediately appreciate it, but time will come and history will give evidence that this movement saved the human society from being fallen into barbarianism.

Regarding the things that Krishna is giving you, everything belongs to Krishna and He is giving everything, even to the nondevotees, even to the animals who have no consciousness of Krishna; and what to speak of His devotees. Just like the father maintains all his children without any grudge, but the child who is very faithful to the orders of the father is given specific care by the father. Similarly, Krishna being the Father of all living entities, he is supplying the bare necessities of their life; but for His devotees He has got special attention. So depend on Krishna, chant regularly Hare Krishna and you will find that He is talking with you face to face, what to speak of supplying your necessities. This is a great science, and please try to understand it nicely.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
