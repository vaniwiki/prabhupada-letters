====== Letter to: Nandarani ======

Dallas

My dear Nandarani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 3, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your going away, I did not take very seriously. I am very glad that you have come back. You should remain with Dayananda. That is your duty. He is a very good boy. So, please remain always fixed in devotional service and live peacefully.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
