====== Letter to: Gurukrpa ======

Honolulu

My dear Gurukrpa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. From your telephone conversation with Brahmananda Swami I understand you have paid DNP another $28,000.00. You are keeping 10 men there in Japan, and even if the collection will not be so much as you were doing, that is all right, just as long as it goes on. Regarding setting up a jewelry business in Japan, that is all right. That the men started with $50 and now have $25,000 worth of stock is a good business. Are they our men?

Regarding investing in a new restaurant, it doesn't matter it may be $100,000. If there is profit there, then you can invest. I want that all of our householders be engaged in managing these restaurants.

You cannot sell the Hawaii house. It is a good house, and I do not approve selling it. If you want to expand, then you can purchase other houses for residences. I do not want any of our houses to be sold. I have no objection to your moving the farm on the same island with the temple, but you can purchase a farm separate and keep the present house. What will be gained by selling the house? I do not like this idea.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
