My dear Akshayananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 30th January, 1976.

Regarding the program in Kanpur: If the local men are anxious for me to come, then they can spend for my passage. At that time I can go. You should not make me a cheap man simply appearing with others. As I have already said, they can spend for passage for six men going and coming.

Regarding the Gurukula plan, I have instructed Tamal Krsna to write you with his suggestions.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
