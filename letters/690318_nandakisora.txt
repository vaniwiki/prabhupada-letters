====== Nandakisora ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Nanda Kisora,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your very nice poetry; I am reading it again and again and I shall most probably arrange to publish it in BTG. The devotees here also have very much appreciated it, and I may encourage to do more writing of poetry and even articles for our BTG magazine. I hope you are all well and happy there, and please convey my blessings to all your God-brothers and sisters there.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
