My dear Yogesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 27th June, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Very soon I shall be coming to Europe. On the 20th June I will be going to Moscow for five days and from there I will go to Paris and then London. At that time I may come and see your press also.

You write to describe me as a loving servant of the Lord. If you believe me so, then kindly help me in my service. That will help both of us. I want your cooperation fully. Lord Caitanya, although Krishna Himself, appealed to His friends and helpers to help Him in His mission and what to speak of me; I am just an ordinary human being. So I need your help. I have just received a very favorable report from Mandali Bhadra. He is a very nice boy, so work cooperatively with him and let us all serve Krishna. Very soon I shall see you all and give you further instructions.

Yes, these children's books are very important because our next program is to start children's schools in all our centers. We want to train all children from the beginning of life in Krishna Consciousness. In Bombay there is very good prospect for such children's school. So many children come to arati, take prasadam and are liking to look at our books also. So it is a good opportunity for preaching our mission.

So we have to adjust things. Everything is important. Not that we have to do something at the expense of something else. I cannot say from here what is to be given preference. That depends on your management capacity.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
