Dear Dr. Dave,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter dated 28th September, 1976 and noted the contents with care. I am very much pleased that such a highly qualified person as you desire to join our movement. We require many such persons as you to make our movement successful.

"Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues." (Bhagavad-gita, 3.21)

It is the Vedic system that after 50 years of life one has to take to Vanaprastha, then take to Sannyasa.

It will be a great pleasure to meet you again, and if possible please join us as soon as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
