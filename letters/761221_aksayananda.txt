====== Letter to: Aksayananda ======

Vrndavana

My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings

It is very nice that the U. P. State Ministry has booked eleven double rooms in our guesthouse. Kindly give them a good reception and food and deal very nicely with them in all respects. It is very nice that the chokidars have nice uniforms and are working very efficiently. That is wanted. The uniforms for the guesthouse staff should also be ready when the government people come.

I am very anxious to know what happened about the Municipal affair. Please let me know at the earliest.

I hope this letter will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
