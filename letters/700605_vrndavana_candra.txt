====== Vrndavana Candra ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Vrndavana Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your encouraging letter dated 24th May, 1970.

I am so happy to learn that both you and your good wife are now engaged in opening our new center in Baltimore. This opening of new centers gives me the greatest transcendental pleasure, and I beg to thank you very much. It is very good news that you have received such nice cooperation from the City authorities so you can carry out our Sankirtana program with unrestricted distribution of literatures. This is excellent opportunity, so please take full advantage and push on our movement with your greatest enthusiasm.

The house which you have described sounds very good for our purpose. So continue to develop this building for our Baltimore temple. Please also continue to cooperatively join with Philadelphia temple and the other temples for spreading Krsna consciousness by Maha sankirtana, festivals like Janmastami festival to be celebrated at New Vrndavana. I want that all my students will cooperate fully for expanding our movement, and in this way every center will be benefited.

Regarding your visit to the Indian social club, we no not expect very much from such Indians, but you have done best by distributing our literatures to them.

I have already advised that you may get some help from the Eastern temples and Bhagavan das has, I am told, already agreed to send some men to help you in Baltimore.

I beg to thank you for your enthusiastic service attitude, utilize it with determination in the matter of preaching this Krsna consciousness and you will quickly achieve the highest perfectional status of life namely Krsna consciousness.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Vidarba Kanya, and to the other boys and girls who may be there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
