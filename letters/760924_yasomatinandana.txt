====== Yasomatinandana ======

Ahmedabad

My dear Yasomatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 19th inst. and copy of Gujarati magazine. It appears to be nice. So you have got a new house very suitable for our purpose; it is very nice. So try to purchase some land as soon as possible.

Regarding against propoganda, it is going on practically everywhere, especially Bengal. So we have to work very sincerely and Krishna will give us protection. The only hope, we can understand that demons are disturbed. That is quite natural. When Krishna was born, from the day of His birth, the demons wanted to kill him in so many ways but practically it was found that demons were killed by Krishna and He established His mission __yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata / abhyutthanam adharmasya tadatmanam srjamyaham__ [[books:bg:4:7|(Bg. 4.7)]]. So if we work sincerely, the Krishna Consciousness Movement is non-different from Krishna. As Krishna killed all the demons, we should also be able to kill all demons if we remain faithful in the discharge of our mission.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
