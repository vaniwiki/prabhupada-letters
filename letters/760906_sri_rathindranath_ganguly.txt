Dear Sri Ganguly,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 22, 1976 and have noted the contents.

You may come and see me in Vrndavana* at the above address until about the first week in October, otherwise I am expecting to be in Calcutta sometime in December. It is very nice that you have written to me offering your services. This is the mission to all those who have taken their birth as human beings in the land of Bharata-varsa. As stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, __bharat bhumite manusya haila janma yara janma sathaka kare karo para upakara.__ Therefore it is very good that you are taking these instructions of the Lord seriously by surrendering yourself under the direction of His bona fide representative.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Here you can stay with me at least for a month and we can chalk out a programme.\\
