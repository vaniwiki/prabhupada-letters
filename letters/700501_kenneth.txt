My dear Sriman Kenneth,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated April 1970, and I am so pleased to learn that you are chanting Mahamantra Hare Krishna.

It is very much pleasing that you acknowledge the gifts of Krishna. Krishna is the Supreme Father, and all living entities in all different forms are His sons. He is maintaining everyone. He is supplying food, clothing, shelter to each one of His sons, but those who are Krishna Conscious, they admit the gifts of the Father, and thus try to please the Supreme Father by service.

Unfortunately, the demons do not even acknowledge the gifts from Krishna, and they talk nonsense that there is no God, God is dead, I am God, and similar things. So as you are acknowledging your obligation to Krishna, as well as chanting the Hare Krishna Mantra, so I hope Krishna will give you more facilities so that you can become perfect in this very life. It is very easy to achieve such success simply by chanting the Hare Krishna Mantra, and let us not miss this great opportunity.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
