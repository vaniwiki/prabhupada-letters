My dear Acaryaji,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated 21-3-76, and I have noted the contents with care.

I shall be in Vrindaban up until the 10th April after which time I shall be going out of India. You can come to our Vrindaban Temple. You have got enough scope for engaging yourself in journalism and peaceful living. If you are in difficulty then by showing this letter you can take a railroad ticket from our Abhirama das Adhikari, the president of our Calcutta temple located at 3 Albert Road, Calcutta-17, near Camac Street and, Theater Road. It will be a great pleasure to talk with you when we meet.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
