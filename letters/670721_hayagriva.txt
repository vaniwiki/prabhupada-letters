====== Letter to: Hayagriva ======

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I have arranged to start for India tomorrow by Air India, and Kirtanananda is accompanying me. Krishna willing, we shall reach Delhi next Monday morning.

I am trying for your free passage, and have written another letter to the managing director of Scindia Co., and I hope it will be successful.

When you come to India, you'll take my trunk and whatever packages I leave labelled in my room. Also, you should take either the tape recorder I have here, or one which Mr. Kallman will supply. Finally, there is the big Royal typewriter, which you must pack nicely and bring.

I shall let you know my arrival news from India. Hope this will find you all right.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
