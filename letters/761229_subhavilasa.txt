My dear SubhaVilasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 9, 1976 and have noted the contents.

Thank you for helping in this way by taking signatures in support of our movement from the Indian people in Toronto. Yes, I will be happy to visit your home again next time I come to Toronto. In the meantime, please give whatever assistance you can to help manage the temple affairs there.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
