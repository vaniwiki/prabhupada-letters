====== Letter to: Murari ======

London

My dear Murari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated 1st and 6th January, 1971, and I thank you for the copies of Krsna Book payments made to Dai Nippon. I have been doing extensive touring recently and my mailing is not always received or dispatched timely, so this late reply. I think by now your good wife is with you in London once more. I am confident that if you simply take our principles very seriously and follow them rigidly, everything will come out successfully. Our Movement is being carried by spiritual strength from chanting of the Hare Krsna Mahamantra from the lips of pure devotees. Our disciples are pure and therefore the effect is that this movement is gaining in scope all over the world. Now people are highly appreciating our endeavors and they are asking us to open centers in their respective cities and towns. So this is practically the fulfillment of Lord Caitanya's desire and it will come about for certain if you kindly keep the standard set by me and see that others are similarly enthused to follow.

I am very glad that Mukunda will continue to work with you and he will be President of our London Yatra. Both he and Janaki and you and your good wife are our elder students and you try to cooperate with one another for keeping our London center as prominent. If you can expand that will be very nice. I am glad that the center in Birmingham is going on nicely.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Lilavati. Try to increase the sales of our literatures and particularly KRSNA book and that will be a great service.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
