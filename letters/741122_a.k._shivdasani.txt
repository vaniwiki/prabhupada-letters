My dear Sri AK Shivdasani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated 10/11/74 and have noted the contents. We are having discourses here every evening at 7:30pm on Srimad-Bhagavatam and you are cordially invited to attend the discourses as well as the Arati and the Kirtana. Regarding the opening of the Vrindaban Temple that will take place on the Ram Navami day, the appearance of Lord Ramacandra, April, 1975. So you can discuss further with Giriraja for making the necessary arrangements.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
