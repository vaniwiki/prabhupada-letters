====== Karandhara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter and enclosed bank slip for 250.00 dollars but I have not as yet received the bank slip of another 1,400.00 dollars, I hope you have already deposited the same. I am expecting the receipt voucher at any moment.

Regarding initiation of the new devotees, I am sending herewith the names against each of them, the beads may be chanted upon by you and delivered by regular ritualistic ceremony. For second initiation find herewith the sacred threads duly chanted by me and you do the rest work.

My schedule of program is as follows; Sweden on the 5th September after returning I shall go to Japan by the 15th via Tehran and India. Then from Japan I shall return to Los Angeles via Hawaii, estimated by the 10th October. Certainly at that time I shall drive on my Rolls Royce car with great pleasure at least for three months. Pray to Krishna that I may execute my touring program without any disturbance.

I hope this letter will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
