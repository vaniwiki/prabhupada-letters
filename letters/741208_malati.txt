====== Letter to: Malati ======

London

My dear Malati devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated November 19, and December 3, 1974, and have noted the contents. So why the devotees in London are unhappy? What is the situation?

Yes, it is a very good idea to join with your husband. Try to bring him in line. Induce Syamasundara to follow the regulative principles and chant Hare Krishna, and then his position will be secure. Do you think his business is improving or not?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
