My dear Gargamuni Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 25th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. I hope you have received my last letter dated 27th August, 1971 and Bali Mardan and Madhavananda should have arrived there by now.

Also I have asked that Jayapataka send at least 25 complete sets of books there immediately so you should be receiving them soon.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
