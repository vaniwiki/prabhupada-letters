Germany

My dear Harikesa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Sept. 30th, 1976 and have noted the contents. I sent you especially for preaching in that quarter therefore I gave you money, otherwise in U.S.A. what is need of money. You have experience in that area, therefore I gave money. So I request you not to go to U.S.A., even if it is a little difficult to preach in that quarter. I have written to Gurudasa and Sucandra to join you---combine together and preach. In U.S.A. there are many preachers, but here no preachers. Otherwise, if you must preach in English then you may preach in England.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
