====== Hasyapriya ======

Los Angeles

My dear Hasyapriya das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one telephone call from Srutakirti who is presently with our Ambarisa das in Boston. They are attempting to open a beautiful Hare Krishna Restaurant there and they say it is a good place. Ambarisa is prepared to make substantial investment to do this and the problem is that they require some householders to assist in the maintenance and cooking there full time. They need about 8 devotees to work full-time who are dedicated and would like to assist in the opening of the restaurant. It is also a good opportunity to see practically how this is done as Srutakirti and Ambarisa have good experience from the Hawaii Restaurant.

Please contact Srutakirti at the Boston temple and assist them with the devotees necessary if at all possible so that they can develop the Restaurant there very nicely.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
