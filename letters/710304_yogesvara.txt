My dear Yogesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th January, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Yes, I have already received a copy of your book "Krsna, the Cowherd Boy" and also given suggestions for the same. So you can present it to Satsvarupa and the editors and if they approve, then I approve and the book may be printed by our Press.

So far as French translation work, I am very glad to note how nicely you are working, along with your wife Jyotirmayi and also Guy Prabhu. Continue in this way and Krishna will be pleased upon you and bless you with the intelligence to increase your service more and more. When you have printed the three new French BTGs, as well as Easy Journey and Sri Isopanisad, French editions, you may send copies of them here to me for propaganda purposes.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
