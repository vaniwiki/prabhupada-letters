====== Krsna dasa ======

Berlin

My dear Krsna das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 17, 1970, along with one letter from your new wife. I am very much encouraged that you have seriously taken up the matter opening our center in Berlin city and it is a great opportunity for us, I have also received the beads and I have chanted them duly. I am sending them back by separate air post. and the letter addressed to your wife is enclosed herewith.

I am so glad that you are at last happily married. Now utilize this nice opportunity of working combinedly in the service of the Lord. You both have all my blessings for working on in spreading Krsna consciousness movement to the German people and elsewhere in European countries. I think your wife will be of great assistance because she is a fluent linguist. I have given her the spiritual name of Indrani devi Dasi.

It is good news that you are so quickly successful in your Sankirtana and distribution of literatures in Berlin. I am sure that this so large city will prove a very important center for European ISKCON activities. Thank you for your keeping to our regulated program of chanting, study and Sankirtana, etc. If you simply stick to this program which I have given you in so many ways, you will come out successful in your mission, of this there is no doubt. So do it very seriously and enthusiastically and receive the blessings of Lord Krsna for your sincere efforts to spread His Holy Name.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
