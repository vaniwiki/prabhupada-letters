====== Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents.

Regarding our proposals for an Indian program of Krsna Consciousness, I think it will be best if you come here sometime soon at your convenience and we can discuss it in more detail. You also wanted to come here to take further inspiration from the L.A. temple activities. So you may ask Muljibhai to come with you also, and we can discuss together our future plans for India. I will be very glad to see you both at that time.

Regarding Citralekha, her husband is anxious to have her there, and she is also anxious to go to him, so why the matter is being delayed? Even she has applied for immigration visa, that does not mean that she can be detained from going on a visitors visa while the immigration visa is being approved. She has got some urgent business there in Australia, so does it mean that because her immigration visa will take some long time she cannot carry out her important business immediately by means of visitor's visa. So while she is waiting for the immigration visa, send her there with a visitor's visa, and get it done as soon as possible. The matter is being too much delayed. I do not think the immigration department will make such a law that she cannot go immediately to her husband just because her immigration visa has not yet been cleared. Anyway that is my experience. So please do the needful.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
