====== Letter to: Sri Triloki Natha Acarya ======

Sri Triloki Natha Acarya,\\
Jnana, Gudadi (Gudri)\\
Vrindaban, (Mathura District)\\
U.P.

Dear Sri Acaryaji,

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24th February, 1976. It was addressed to Calcutta temple but on account of not mentioning the zonal number, it was delivered very late in Calcutta, then it was redirected here in our above temple.

However, I am so glad to receive your letter and I reply that I require your good help in my preaching work. We are preaching all over the world with great success and you'll be pleased to know that we are selling our books tremendously. The general estimate is collection of Rs. 1 lac to Rs. 5 lac daily. Our preachers are very much enthusiastic but in India they have got a language difficulty. If you cooperate with us along with other learned devotees, we can immediately take up preaching work in India with great enthusiasm. We have got 8 big and small buses and one very nice car for my personal use. If you will start sankirtana movement from town to town and village to village with the cooperation of other learned Indian men like yourself, I'm sure that in very short time our endeavour ill be successful.

Kindly see me on the 30th March, 1976, at Vrindaban in my Krishna-Balarama Temple either in the morning between the hours of 10-12 or in the afternoon between the hours of 5-7 p.m. along with this letter.

Thanking you once more for your willing cooperation.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
