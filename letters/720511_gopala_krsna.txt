====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

New York

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated May 8, 1972, and the check for $517.50. You are so nice and eager to serve Krishna, so all blessings of Krishna will be bestowed upon you, rest assured. Your wife has proven turbulent, that is the grace of Krishna. I may inform you in this connection about my family life. Actually, I never liked my wife. I was going to marry another, but my father saved me from the danger and he told me that you do not like your wife, that is the grace of Krishna. So don't be worried about your wife. If she wants to re-marry, let her do so, and you'll be free and I shall give you Sannyas and you will be preaching freely.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
