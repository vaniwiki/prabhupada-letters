====== Bali-mardana ======

My dear Bali Mardana,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for the copy of BTG #44, it is very nicely done. I think you are doing very nicely there in ISKCON Press, so you should stick there and manage everything as you are already doing. So far your GBC duties are concerned, everything is going very nicely here and in Australia in your absence, so for the time being there is no need for you to come here. I am going to Hong Kong on the 19th, and there we shall discuss if Bhurijana may open one center in Manila, as he has suggested. Then on 20th we fly to Tokyo, and on May 6th we shall reach Honolulu. So I shall be very much satisfied if you stay there at ISKCON Press and go on increasing the beauty and importance of our Back to Godhead magazine, and be happy.

One thing is that book profits must be deposited in my Book Fund Account, at least 15%. But this we shall discuss.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
