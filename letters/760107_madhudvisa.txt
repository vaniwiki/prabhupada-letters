====== Madhudvisa ======

Melbourne

My dear Madhu-dvisah Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 10th December, 1976. I have noted the contents carefully.

Mr. Deoji Punja came to see me in Bombay. If any of the trustees are to be dropped, this has to be discussed between the trustees themselves. These are all important men and we should be careful lest they become offended. If I say something it will not look well. If some of the trustees are not abiding by the principles or not chanting 16 rounds, then they should be induced by the other trustees who are following, to step down. I think you can follow what I mean.

Now Upendra is waiting in Hawaii, so please direct him how he should proceed. I have also asked him to write Mr. Punja.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
