====== Syama ======

My dear Syama dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I an in due receipt of your nice letter, and I thank you very much for your kind sentiments. You are very nice girl, and just suitable for working together with Hayagriva on the Srimad-Bhagavatam. This very much encourages me. I want such Grhastha couples in this movement to set examples for others to follow.

I am happy to hear you are very much liking living at New Vrindaban, and that you are anxiously awaiting receipt of your first cow. I am also very much concerned about you health; I have written Hayagriva in this connection. But I do not know what could be the cause of this illness. Please let me know what are the reports given by the doctor. But it is good that you are keeping even greater amount of faith in Krishna, and are chanting 35 rounds daily. Keep up this good attitude and surely you will be saved from all dangers.

I hope you are by this time feeling stronger and I shall be awaiting your letter how you are doing,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I shall see you at New Vrindaban by 10th May, 1969
