====== Letter to: Yamuna ======

London

My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter of December 16, 1968 and I have noted the contents carefully and with pleasure. So far as the mistake on the certificates, I think that only on the certificates to be given to brahmacarinis is it necessary to change the spelling, because on the brahmacari's certificate this word Srimate will be crossed out. So on the certificates for the brahmacarinis, you may cover the letter "e" with a white paint and insert the correct letter "i", making the word read "Srimati". So do this nicely and it will be all right. It is all right to read the books you have mentioned, namely Swami Bon's __Bhakti Ramsamrita Shindu__ and __Caitanya Caritamrta__ by Nagendra Kumar Ray, but you will be pleased to know that we are now composing the __Nectar of Devotion,__ which is a complete summary of the __Bhakti Rasamrita Shindu.__ Regarding the translation by Bon Maharaja, it is only one quarter of the complete work and I do not know if the other parts will come out very shortly.

So far as having the Radha-Krishna murtis carved for Rs 1000, it is too costly. Continue to negotiate with Jaya Govinda on this matter. Here in Los Angeles, one boy, Nara Narayana, is planning to attempt murtis in bronze but I do not know that he will be successful.

So please convey my blessings to your husband, and I hope that you are both well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
