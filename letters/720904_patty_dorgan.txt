My dear Patty Dorgan,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated September 1, 1972, and I have noted the contents with pleasure. I am so pleased to hear that you are living nicely with your parents and carrying on with your Krishna Consciousness activities. That is a good proposal. Never mind there maybe some inconvenience. Krishna always appreciates when his devotee makes some sacrifice on His behalf, so there is no real difficulty under any conditions so long as we remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just like Prahlada Maharaja, he never asked Krishna for anything, oh Krishna please save me from my demon father, no. But because he was always remembering Krishna under all circumstances, Krishna saved him anyway, and when He became finally angry He came Himself and killed the demon father. But even Krishna came Himself, still Prahlada did not ask Him for any favors, only to please kindly have mercy upon my father. That is pure devotee. Of course we cannot imitate, but we should always try to remember the example of our predecessors and follow their example always.

I am very much encouraged to hear that you want to open a Krishna Yoga Society branch in your high-school, along with Lalitananda. That will be the bet service to Lord Caitanya, and it is the best gift you can give me. Thank you very much for helping me in this way.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
