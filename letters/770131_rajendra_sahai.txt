Dear Rajendra Sahai, 

Please accept my blessings. I was very glad to receive your note hand carried by my disciple Prtha Prthu (sic) [Prthu Putra] Maharaj who came from Kumbha Mehla.

The news that the Mahant of the Sri Beni Madhava temple is thinking of turning the management over to the Krsna Consciousness Movement, is very welcome. I appreciate your working on our behalf to bring this about. I know the Beni Madhava temple is famous and associated in the Pastimes of Lord Caitanya.

I would like to invite you to be our guest in our annual observance of Gour Purnima at our International Center in Mayapur, Navadwipa. We can talk over how to chalk out a plan for future cooperation and worship in the Beni Madhava temple.

Hope this finds you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
