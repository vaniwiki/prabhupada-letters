====== Hiranyagarbha ======

New Vrndavana

My dear Hiranyagarbha das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 26th 1974 and have noted the contents. Jagadisa prabhu has informed me that he has already gone over the points with you at New Vrndavana recently. In teaching the children, you should refer very carefully to my books. The qualities of a brahman as mentioned in BG chapter 18: __sama dama tapasocam__ [[books:bg:18:42|(Bg. 18.42)]]. You must teach these qualities. These qualities will naturally come out, if you just give the process purely. The information is there in my books so if you strictly adhere to them then your program of teaching will be successful. First of all you must teach by your personal example. This is the principle of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu (apani acari bhakti pracaram). So you yourself must chant 16 rounds and follow the regulative principles and automatically they will do as you are doing. Then they will become strong Vaisnavas.

Regarding the initiation of Jon Walsh, please let me know if he was initiated there in New Vrndavana. If not then I will initiate him.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
