My dear Sriman Susheel Asnani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 27, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care. The best thing is that you engage yourself in chanting the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra as many times as possible and Krishna will save you. I wish that all your family members should chant, your wife especially, for your prolonged life. Whenever you find time please go to the Bombay temple and offer your sincere obeisances to Lord Krishna. Nobody's life will continue in this material world but if we practice Krishna Consciousness, then certainly by giving up this body one goes back to Home, back to Godhead. As said by Lord Krishna Himself in the Bhagavad-gita:

> janma karma ca me divyam
> evam yo vetti tattvatah
> tyaktva deham punar janma
> naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
> [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]]

"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal Abode, O Arjuna."

I hope that this meets you in good spirits.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
