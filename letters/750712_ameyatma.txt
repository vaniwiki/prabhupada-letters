My dear Ameyatma das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 27, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your nice sentiments. Yes, this is the proper for you to satisfy your spiritual master. It is stated: yasya prasada bhagavata prasada. By the mercy of Krsna one gets the mercy of Krsna.

As far as your writing additional poetry is concerned, do not spend very much time in this way. It is not very important. There are already so many prayers written by great acaryas. What will you add to this? However if you have got some spare time and the inclination, you can read the chapters of Krsna Book and put them into verse.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
