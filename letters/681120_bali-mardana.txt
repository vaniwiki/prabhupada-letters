====== Bali-mardana ======

My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter and I have the noted the contents with great care. Yes, it is a very good opportunity for spreading our KC movement. We require unlimited money for constructing New Vrindaban and other schemes in KC. So if it is possible to get some money from your father's business and employ it in KC, it will be glorious both for your father and your self. It is a very good opportunity that he has supplied you car and does not object to KC. So gradually turn your father to KC. Not immediately, but gradually. In the meantime you can serve your father working at his business and live like an aristocratic American gentleman, use his car, chant Hare Krishna, and live with the devotees at the temple. Anyway, your temple attendance __must__ continue. So if it is possible that you shall live with the boys at the temple, then that is very good idea, and work also with your father. Please keep me informed how you are arranging for this matter, as I will be anxious to hear.

Hoping you are well,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
