====== Letter to: Rupanuga ======

Potomac, Maryland

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 29, 1976.

Kirtanananda's offer to Brisakapi is good. If one is fully engaged in preaching, his mind will be subdued. That is the only way. Yadavadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde.

Your description of the steps being taken to rally support is nice. It is wanted, both from the parents and the Indian residents. If you can take the lawyer training as you have described that's nice. The cover for Sa-vijnanam is very good. Yes, Makhanlal is very sincere, so try to work with him.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
