My dear Mr. Ogata,

Please accept my greetings. By experience, we gather that Japanese ladies and gentlemen are very much interested with our Krishna Consciousness movement, especially with our literature, and more specifically with Srimad-bhagavatam. Here in Hawaii, many Japanese gentlemen, they purchase Srimad-bhagavatam simply by hearing the name, but they have got the language difficulty---they don't know English. So, if our books were translated into Japanese language, it will be a great help to us and to you also because it will be another opportunity for printing books. So, why not give us a good translator who can regularly translate all our books into Japanese? This will be another enterprise for printing in your press. So, if you can arrange for this with a Japanese scholar, or if you take this responsibility, then it will give me great pleasure.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours very sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
