My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 11, 1974 the copy of which was forwarded to me here at our New Vrindaban. I am very pleased to know that things are going on according to routine. This morning we held a meeting of GBC members, and I have sent a telegram addressed to Karandhara as follows:

"YOUR RESIGNATION ACCEPTED AFTER CONSULTATION WITH GBC GIVE CHARGE TO JAGADISHA"---BHAKTIVEDANTA SWAMI\\
So you note this and inform others. Jagadisa is immediately going there to India to take charge.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
