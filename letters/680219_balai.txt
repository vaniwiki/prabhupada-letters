====== Balai ======

New York

My dear Balai dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for the Istagosthi notes, and also your nice letter of Feb. 14, 1968. I have read them over, and the question which was asked about why people did not see Krishna as blue, question no. 5; you can't see Krishna with material eyes.

Please continue sending the notes from the meetings; I am very pleased to read how my students are relishing the discussions of Krishna and His Associates.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,
