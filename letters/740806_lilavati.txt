====== Letter to: Lilavati ======

Geneva

My dear Lilavati devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 14, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to learn that your illness is cured. You can take it that it is Krsna's mercy. So now I think you have got good engagement there, so continue it always thinking of Krsna at every moment.

At present Vaikunthanatha Prabhu is doing the typing of the tapes, so if you remain there and work in the pujari department nicely, then that will please me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
