====== Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 24, 1973. Your book selling report is very encouraging to me, so much so that I want to go there immediately. Anyway as soon as I get opportunity I shall go to Australia to visit all the nice places you have started and stay there for at least two months. Krishna has given you great opportunity to preach the Krishna Caitanya cult in that remote part of the world. The time was there some years ago when Australia would not allow any colored men to enter, but now you have allowed Caitanya Mahaprabhu to enter Australia and inundated the whole country with Hari Nama Sankirtana. Caitanya Mahaprabhu's another name is Pita Baranara Gaura, so by your combined effort I hope that one day Pita Baranara Gaura will rule over Australia. I think that Australia is a great field for these activities as it is evident from the book sales statistics gradually increasing. I am very much encouraged in this respect.

I am going on the 5th September for a few days to Stockholm, Sweden, then returning to London, and leaving here on the 15th September for Japan via Iran, and India. I expect to reach Los Angeles by the 10th October.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
