====== Mahavirya ======

Hyderabad

Dear Mahavirya das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 9, 1975 redirected from Los Angeles. I am very glad to hear that you are working so nicely in developing the project there. It is very important, and I am very encouraged that you are taking it seriously.

The modern civilization is a condemned civilization. The innocent people are being dragged from the villages and exploited in the cities. But in the Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna recommends them to remain where they are and produce grains: annad bhavanta bhutani. Grow your food, eat sumtuously, and chant Hare Krishna. This is real life. If we establish such projects all over India, we shall be the proprietor of India. Similarly in the USA. And if USA and India join together in such Krishna consciousness projects, then the whole world will be paradise. Krishna provides everything, but we mismanage it. Even in this condemned world He has provided everything complete. He is so perfect. Krishna wants us to pass on our days here in Krishna consciousness, and then go back home, back to Godhead.

This village program is for the ordinary class of people, and for the intellectuals we have got our books. We are not lacking in anything.

I hope this meets you in good health. I very much like that place in Hyderabad. That tree is very nice. I was sleeping underneath it. It is a pleasant place. Now develop it first class.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
