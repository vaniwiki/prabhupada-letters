====== Letter to: Sudama ======

Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your encouraging letter dated 14th June, 1970.

Your proposals for extending Sankirtana Party activities and distribution of literatures and organizing Tokyo center as the headquarters for our Far Eastern branches of ISKCON are very encouraging, so try to substantiate these ideas.

Regarding printing of Japanese BTG with Tosho or Dai Nippon, that is nice. But why 10,000? Why not 100,000? The more you increase the number of BTGs that is very encouraging. Sometimes back you mentioned one Japanese lady attached to Ramakrishna Mission who was translating our literatures---so what has happened to her?

It is very good news that you are getting your branch of ISKCON incorporated in Japan. That is nice. So you write to say that things are taking shape very nicely. It is all Krsna's grace. You have gone with great hope and enthusiasm, so Krsna is giving you all opportunities. So try to serve Krsna with greater enthusiasm, then you will get greater facilities.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
