My dear Sudarsana devi,

Please accept my blessings. In reply to your letter, Jan. 31 1968, which I received just day before yesterday, I have accepted you as initiated student and your spiritual name is Srimati Sudarsana devi. (One who looks forward on the Sudarsan wheel in the hand of Krishna)

Please follow the regulations and chant 16 rounds daily at least without any offense. The list of offenses, 10 kinds, are in my apartment in N.Y., and you ask your God-brother, Brahmananda, and he will supply you. Similarly, there is another list of the qualifications, as well as prayer for Spiritual Master, are also there. Try to secure them, and follow the regulations, and Krishna will help you in being elevated to higher and higher platforms of Krishna Consciousness. Thanking you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
