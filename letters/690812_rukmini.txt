====== Rukmini ======

My dear Rukmini Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated July 27th, 1969, sent along with your new beads, and I am enclosing the beads herewith duly chanted upon by me. I am pleased to learn that Bharadraja has completed the Sankirtana picture and you are now doing a painting of Krishna and Arjuna. All such paintings may be forwarded to me as soon as possible. We require so many paintings now as we are planning to print so many illustrated books and there are so many new temples that are opening of our Krishna Consciousness Movement. So as many nice paintings as you are able to do can be well-utilized. If you would like to go to Boston, husband and wife, you could work conjointly with Jadurani. In Boston they now have a large house with nice accommodations for many devotees, so if you are able to go, that will be nice. Regarding the questions you have asked, it is better to refer such questions to our householder women. If your ailment is persisting, you may consult a physician what you should to.

I thank you for the nice sentiments you have expressed, and I am awaiting to see the pictures that you and Bharadraja have completed. Please offer my blessings to Bharadraja and to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
