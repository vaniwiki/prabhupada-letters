====== Nara-narayana ======

My dear Nara Narayana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 21, 1969, and I thank you very much for it. I have heard many nice reports from various parties complimenting the expert service you are performing in New York with your carpentry and handyman skills. So I am very pleased to hear that Krishna has blessed you with a very nice talent, and you are now using it rightly in Krishna Consciousness.

Now I have also read in your letter under reply that you are successfully engaged in Sankirtana Party activities in New York, and this too is encouraging to hear. So I think that you should be encouraged in this connection, but one thing is that your Sankirtana activities may go on as long as you are working under the sanction of Brahmananda, and he finds there to be no difficulties with this additional temple's activity. Sankirtana is very important service, so as far as Brahmananda feels there is no inconvenience upon other important engagements, you may continue in assisting the organizing of the New York temple's Sankirtana Party.

Regarding casting of the Radha Krishna Deities, I have already instructed you about casting in plaster of Paris. The whole thing is that we wish to have these Deities nicely done and as soon as possible. So I think that this idea of using plaster of Paris will be very easily and quickly executed. The mold may be made from the Deities already in New York, so, as far as I know, this will be the most practical method for seeing this task completed.

Thanking you once more for your letter and important work you are sincerely performing. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
