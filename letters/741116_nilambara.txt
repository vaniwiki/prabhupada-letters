====== Letter to: Nilambara ======

Detroit

My dear Nilambara dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated together with letters from your friends and I am glad to see they are taking serious interest along with yourself in this movement of Lord Caitanya. Try to understand this philosophy very nicely and get more numbers to join. I am especially interested to see the Americans spread this movement. America is already blessed by Krishna, and if they become Krishna conscious, they will become more glorious. There is an Indian saying, "fragrance in gold." Gold is already valuable, but if it has got some nice fragrance, then it becomes even more valuable.

If some percentage of Americans become Vaisnavas, it will be wonderful for the future of the world. It will be a great example for the world. So you yourself take to the process with heart and soul and always follow my instructions, and Krishna will bless you to convince many souls to become Krishna conscious.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
