Dear Sir,

__r.e. My Fixed Deposit Account #6004600__

I beg to inform you that I am purchasing one house at Venice Boulevard and I have to pay $63,500 on or before the 25th August, 1972. Kindly therefore transfer $20,000 to my checking account in the Bank of America branch #308 in favor of my account #3081-61625. The fixed deposit receipt is laying in the safe deposit box #361 in your bank. If it is necessary to present this document then I shall instruct my representative in Los Angeles to go to you with the key and he will deliver the receipt.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
