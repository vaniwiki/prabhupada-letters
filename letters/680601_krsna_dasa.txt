====== Krsna dasa ======

My dear Krsna dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter dated May 25, 1968, and I am very pleased that although you are the youngest of my disciples, amongst the boys, your sentiments are very highly developed. Please continue to feel Krishna in the same way, and chant regularly, without fail, you will improve more and more. By your gracious connection with your family, all the members of your family, namely, your sister, your two younger brothers, as well as your mother, are coming in contact with Krishna Consciousness. As you are the eldest son of your mother, it is your duty to guide them properly so that they can also become advanced in Krishna Consciousness. Certainly it is a fact that all of you are combined together in a family way by the Grace of Krishna. And by His Grace only you have come in contact with me. Personally I have no credit for myself, but I am trying to act as faithful servant of my predecessors and just presenting without any adulteration the message which I have received from my Spiritual Master. Similarly, if this message is presented by you all who have accepted me as the Spiritual Master, then all the people of the world may be benefited by receiving this transcendent message of Krishna Consciousness. Try to execute this mission wholeheartedly and faithfully, and all of you try to broadcast the message to your best capacity. I am so glad to learn that your two brothers are growing very nicely, and I hope in future they will be great help to this missionary activities, and so I think also of your nice sister, Saradia. Please try to guide them properly.

I note that you have got now $700.00; keep it intact and increase it up to $1200.00 at least, so that in case we have to go to India, you will have to purchase a return ticket. I am going to Montreal and later developments will be known to you gradually. Yes, that shark is all right. Thank you very much for your offerings.

Your humbleness is very much appreciated by me. This humbleness is the sign of progress in Krishna Consciousness. A Krishna Consciousness person thinks always about himself as the lowest creature in the world, and the more one thinks like that he becomes elevated more and more. A Krishna Conscious person is never falsely puffed-up; he is satisfied with his humble position as the servant of the servant of the servant of Krishna [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|(Cc. Madhya 13.80)]]. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
