====== Letter to: Krsnavesa ======

London

My dear Krsnavesa dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 10th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your nice book-bag.

My request to you is that you try to follow the authorities there, the temple president, the GBC, etc.---co-operated nicely with them. Our movement is based on love and trust, so if we do not co-operate, then how is that love and trust? Follow all of the rules and regulations very strictly without deviation, chant 16 rounds, attend class and mangala arati and then everything will be alright.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
