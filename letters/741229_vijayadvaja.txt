My dear Vijayadvaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents carefully. My feeling is that Mr. Punja should be encouraged as much as possible. He can help our movement there a great deal in Fiji. I have written him one letter asking him to take charge of management, handling of money and the registration of the society. I request you to also remain there, work nicely with Mr. Punja and take charge of the preaching, kirtanas, prasadam and book distribution programs. This is actually the work for a brahmacari. If you absorb yourself in this work you will feel very blissful. Keep that center that Subala Maharaja has opened and try to invite as many guests as possible. Make sure to keep yourself and the boys with you in full Krsna Consciousness by following our regulative principles very strictly without fail; chanting 16 rounds, rising early, attending mangala arati, attending classes, eating only Krsna prasadam, etc. In this way the whole atmosphere will become Vaikuntha, no anxiety. Please try to do like this with all sincerity and Krsna will give you all facilities. Please keep me informed of the progress there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
