My dear Prabhuswarupa das, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2 April, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. On the enclosed letter of yours dated April 1976 and signed by the good men of the community involved with Sripat Bari, there are several points which need clarification. Firstly, the sketch of the land is not containing any dimensions. A more detailed map should be sent to me with the length and breadth measured in yards and clearly indicated on your sketch. How can a plan be drawn up without this information? Secondly, you mentioned in your letter under #2 that you "unanimously accepted the proposals contained" but "with some reservations." Kindly indicate clearly what reservations there may be. Thirdly, approximately what amount has Sri Gour Kishore Majumdar thus far contributed to the Sripat Bari, and what amount is he to contribute further towards the development of the Sripat Bari.

You can send this information to my Bombay center at the following address:

c/o Hare Krishna Land\\
Gandhi Gram Road, \\
Juhu, Bombay 400-054

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Yours faithfully, \\
A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
