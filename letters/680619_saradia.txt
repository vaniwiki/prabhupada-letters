My dear Saradia,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated May 30, 1968, and I was just awaiting another letter from your intimate friend Ali Krishna. I am so glad to learn that Ali Krishna and you are all living with Malati and Syamasundara. We have recently got a newcomer baby, Srimati Sarasvati devi, and pleased to learn that they are taking all care for you. I am also very glad that your mother is also taking part in Krishna Conscious activities. I have received one letter from Lilavati also, and I have replied her. I am very glad to know also that the injury in your hand is now cured.

Yes, I am happy to hear that you are going to visit with Jadurani. She will be very much happy to see you also.

We are preparing for starting for London and very soon we shall go there. And as soon as the newly born child is little strong, Malati and Syamasundara, along with you, may come to London and start our Sankirtana movement there.

Hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
