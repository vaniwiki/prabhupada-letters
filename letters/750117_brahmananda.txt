====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

Frankfurt

My dear Brahmananda Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 11-1-75 and have noted the contents. If Karandhara can continue to pay the 9,000 dollars monthly, then what is the necessity of change? Let him continue.

Regarding the lawyer, is it necessary to pay 20,000 dollars? Can this be avoided? Unnecessarily, we cannot spend so much.

I will be going to Hawaii on Jan. 26th. You can let me know what is the situation by mailing a report there. It is contemplated that we are going to South America afterwards. So, if your business is finished up, then you can join us directly from London to Caracas, but if the South American program does not take place, then I may come back through L.A., New York, London, etc.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
