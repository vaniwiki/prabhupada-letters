====== Gopijanavallabha ======

Dear Gopijanavallabha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 3, 1974. The names submitted by you for initiation of devotees in our New York temple are duly accepted by me. The spiritual names of my new disciples are as follows:\\
Charles Schisler---Caturvyuha dasa\\
Edward D. Schindler---Indriyesa dasa\\
Humberto Colonia---Hunkara dasa\\
Joe Fairbank---Janesvara dasa\\
Nick D'Angelo---Nirantara dasa\\
Peter Drivas---Preraka dasa\\
Walter Bryant---Uttariyadhara dasa\\
Wayne Boyd---Vipramukhya dasa\\
Roy Edwards---Ramabhadra dasa

Now so many new devotees have to be carefully kept and instructed so from the beginning they chant 16 rounds daily without fail and always keep the four prohibitive principles very strictly. The GBC man, Bali Mardan may chant on their beads and you may hold a fire yajna in the temple.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
