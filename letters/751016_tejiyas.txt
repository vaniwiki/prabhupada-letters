====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one telegram from Navayogendra stating "Congratulations. All devotees will receive visa for three years confirmed." Please explain the situation there to me. I have not received any further information yet concerning this.

Also, Pusta Krishna Swami is going to purchase one car for my travelling purposes in India and for this I want you to get him a three year visa from the government. The following information will be helpful.

Paul Howard Dossick

Passport number---Z2269551

Issued---U.S. Embassy London, England on May 5, 1975

Expiration date May 4, 1980

Birth date Feb. 8, 1950

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.\\
Please forward the visa to him in Johannesburg as quickly as possible. Also, kindly find out what are the regulations if a tourist brings (drives) his car into India and forward this information to Pusta Krishna Swami in Johannesburg.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Does it mean that the 50 devotees who we applied for will get three year visa or that all devotees will get three year visa?\\
