====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

Kathmandu

My dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18th August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. As per your request I have immediately sent one brahmacari, Madhavananda Das, there to assist you. He is just now on his way to Delhi and then will go on to Nepal immediately. So he should be reaching there very soon. Please receive him at the air station. He is going via Delhi and also in Delhi there is Bali Mardan, so I have asked Bali Mardan to go to Nepal along with Madhavananda for some time also. If things are going on nicely there then we can send some more men later on but first of all try with these two men. Hold kirtanas, distribute prasadam and hold discourses and I am sure that this process will soften the hard stone.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
