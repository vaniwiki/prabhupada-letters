====== Dayananda ======

My dear Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to read your letter of appreciation for my services, and I can understand that you are making good strides in Krishna Consciousness. May Krishna bless you more and more so that your ambition to preach Krishna Consciousness may be successfully carried out. Both you and your wife, Nandarani, are very intelligent, and I have several times received her letters, and she is also making very good progress. It is the Grace of Lord Krishna that He has put me in contact with so many rare souls who are taking Krishna Consciousness in all seriousness, and I am confident that in the future all my student boys and girls will preach this Krishna Consciousness in the western world more successfully.

Due to my indifferent health, for the time being I am going to India; and even if I cannot come back, I will work for an American house there so all you transcendental children can come there and learn and be strong enough to preach this cult for the benefit of all the human society.

I thank you very much for your appreciation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
