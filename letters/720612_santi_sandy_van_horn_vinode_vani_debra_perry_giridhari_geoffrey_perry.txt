Houston

My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Pusta Krishna Swami I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent by separate post. I have given you spiritual names as follows:

Sandy Van Horn/ Santi devi dasi\\
Debra Perry/ Vinode Vani devi dasi\\
Geoffrey Perry/ Giridhari dasa

I am so glad to learn that all of you have been such a great help to Pusta Krishna there in our Houston center. If you stick to our principles with determination, then you will become free from all attachment to amaya, by Krishna’s Grace.
