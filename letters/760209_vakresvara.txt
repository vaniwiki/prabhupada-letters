====== Vakresvara ======

Puebla, Mexico

My dear Vakresvara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 12, 1976.

Thank you for the sentiments you have expressed. As far as serving me is concerned, you should chant 16 rounds of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra and obey the four restrictions---no meat eating, no gambling, no intoxication, and no illicit sex life. Also as much as possible go to our temple in Mexico City, nearby you, and associate with the devotees there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
