====== Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am just now in receipt of five tapes collected from Detroit. So I think all the tapes that were sent to Detroit and Boston are now within your jurisdiction. In the meantime, I also sent you L.A. Tapes #12, 13, and 16, and today I am sending #17. This means all the tapes recorded in L.A. are now in your custody. So instead of sending tapes anywhere else, the tapes will go regularly to Boston.

Now what I want is that one tape in two days must be finished for being composed. This does not mean that one tape has to be finished so quickly, but the arrangement should be made in such a way that after some time the process will produce at least fifteen tapes completely in one month or 30 days. The process should be in the same way as I have suggested for painting of the pictures. The process is like this:

Suppose on Monday you receive the tape number 17, let it be transcribed in two days by someone "A." Then in the next two days (days 3 and 4) someone "B" edits it. Then in the next two days (days 5 and 6) another "C" edits it for the second time. Then Mr. "D" gives it the diacritical marks, and then it is ready for composing.

With diacritical marks, one copy should come to me for my record. The idea is that this #17 tape takes 7 days to the point of composition. In the meantime, tape #18 is coming into the process just in the same order. So I receive the final copy of tape #18 just 2 days after receiving tape #17 copy. If you follow this process, then ultimately we shall be finishing one tape in two days.

Now, if we finish 15 tapes in a month, it comes to near about 300 pages per month. Therefore, very safely we can calculate that every 2 months we produce a book. Or, in other words, in every year we produce 6 books. We wish to print at least sixty books, so it will take ten years. So if you go on under this process, then at least we can hope to finish 60 books by that time. And the time allowed is quite reasonable.

I have talked already about this with Brahmananda, and he says that it will be done. Anyway try to process the work in the above way and let me know how far it is feasible.

So far I have not received the final copies of the tapes returned by you. So think over this matter and make the process complete, and let me know what you have done in this connection.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
