====== Tamala Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
Calcutta

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. With reference to your telephone conversation yesterday morning, I am sending one check, no. CHT/A-T492826 for Rs 8300/- in favor of American Express Banking Corporation, Calcutta, account number 090031. (I hope immediately upon presentation of this check you will get the money from American Express.) There is no question of pilferage because it is account paid. Conveyance deed should be in the name of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness at #3, Albert Road; Calcutta-16. You should consult your friend Mr. Kashore Mukherjee or his friend Mr. Shah and make the deed nicely and send me a copy for my approval. The deed may be drawn in either English or Bengali, as it is required but be careful in every other detail in consultation with pleader Kisora Mukherjee.

You may inform Jayapataka Maharaja that he should purchase at least 25 beads and send them here immediately. Send them to the above-given address.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
