====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejiyas Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 6, 1973 and have noted the contents. I am glad to learn that your festival preperations are well under way. My program is that by the 25th of October I shall go to Delhi for one or two days and then to Vrindaban up to the 8th of November. I will come to Delhi on the 9th for the festival, and on the 19th or 20th I shall have to start for Nairobi.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
