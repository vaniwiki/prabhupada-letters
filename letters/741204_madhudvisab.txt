====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

Melbourne

My dear Madhudvisa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 25, 1974 and have noted the contents. Yes, it is a good idea to ship ghee 1200 lbs. twice yearly. You can ship once in January and once in June. I shall talk further with you, when I come there next month. In the meantime you can let me know to which port the ship generally comes to India, whether to Bombay or Calcutta. Which port is nearer?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
