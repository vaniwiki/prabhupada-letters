====== Letter to: Trivikrama ======

Japan

My dear Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. It is understood that you have come back from Korea. I do not know why you have come back. You wanted to organize our preaching there. If Korea attempt has not proven very fruitful, you can come immediately to the U.S.A.

I am here in Hawaii and when you come we shall talk in detail. Maybe you shall be required by Tamala Krishna Goswami and Dhrstadyumna Maharaja for organizing world book distribution.

In any case, I have heard the report from Pusta Krishna Swami concerning the visa situation in Korea, and if you are trying for Missionary Visa then you can apply for it here in America.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
