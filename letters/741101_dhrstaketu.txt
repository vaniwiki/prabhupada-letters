====== Letter to: Dhrstaketu ======

Dallas

My dear Dhrstaketu das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 1, 1974 and have read the contents with care. With regard to the offenses you are hearing it is not ghosts as you say, but they are creations of your mind. The mind is indeed wretched as you say. Therefore Krishna says that for the endeavoring transcendentalist he must first control the mind, and then by controlling the mind he will have peace. He says: __jitamanah prasantasya, Paramatma smahitah.__ "For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquillity." [[books:bg:6:7|(Bg. 6.7)]] In this age the easiest method for controlling the mind, as taught to us by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, is the chanting of Hare Krishna.

Do not give very much importance to this thing. Chant Hare Krishna. That is my instruction to you.

I hope this meets both you and your wife in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
