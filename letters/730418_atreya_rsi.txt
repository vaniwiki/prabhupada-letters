====== Atreya Rsi ======

My dear Atreya Rsi:

Please accept my blessings. You have suggested that if property is purchased in New York, we can be free from the taxes. So M-V Trust can immediately purchase property in New York and can make down payment of $70,000. So if there is any suitable property available, please send me the particulars, what is the description, the price, the income. Please do this at your earliest.

What is the outcome of that Columbia Club? I am interested in that house.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
