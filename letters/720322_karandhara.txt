====== Karandhara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am so much thankful to you for your letter dated nil, and for the telegram wherein you have requested that I shall return to Los Angeles immediately if possible, and all blessings to you for Lord Krishna that you are endeavoring to propagate the message of Krishna Consciousness so widely and diligently. This television program is very much encouraging to me, and I wish to take part in it immediately. I wanted to cancel all other engagements and go direct to Los Angeles, but if I go in that way my promised visit to Sydney and to Japan especially will be frustrated.

So take little patience at least for one month, I'm sure that by end April I shall reach Los Angeles.

One thing more, if we are successful in this program then my dreamt mission of life to spread Krishna Consciousness all over the world will be fulfilled. I wish to speak on the great philosophy of Bhagavata Dharma at least once in a week on Television, so if arrangement is made by you for this, then you will be doing the highest service for Krishna.

Thanking you once more for your endeavor. More when we meet.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
