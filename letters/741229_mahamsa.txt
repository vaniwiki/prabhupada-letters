====== Mahamsa ======

Hyderabad

My dear Mahamsa,

Please accept my blessings. Upon Acyutananda Swamis recommendation I have accepted the following as my duly initiated disciples: Rangacari---Radhasaran dasa, Amarnath---Aradhana dasa, Chalapati---Chandrodaya dasa, Asoka---AmiyaVilasa dasa. There beads have been chanted on by me and have been sent by %%__%% das brahmacari to Hyderabad. Please make sure that these boys follow the 4 regulative principles very carefully and chant 16 nice rounds daily. They must rise early, attend mangala arati and all classes.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
