====== Letter to: Mark Buchwald ======

My dear Mark Buchwald,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter of January 19, 1969, and I have carefully read the contents. You have stated that you have spent twenty two years of my life in the darkness of ignorance, and actually until any person has come to the standard of Krishna Consciousness he is supposed to be considered as being covered by ignorance. There are different degrees of ignorance however, and to come to the highest perfectional platform of knowledge is to surrender fully to the Lotus Feet of Krishna.

Because you have asked me to assign you to some duty, I think that your first duty is to regularly attend all of our classes. Chant Hare Krishna as long as possible, and try to help in the activities of the temple. Also, we have got so many literatures and books for sale, so if you can help in selling these books and magazines that will be a great help.

You have also consulted me for advice about some of your personal problems, and I think that for these matters you should consult Hansadutta to help you work out some solution. Things will be shaped as Krishna desires. I thank you again for the kind sentiments expressed by you in your letter. If you simply stick with Krishna Consciousness you will very practically see how your life will increasing become more and more sublime. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
