====== Letter to: Ramesvara Prabhu ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 1, 1975. I have noted the contents carefully.

Regarding sending money, you have promised to send 50,000 per month to Bombay. So now the project is underway, so you have to keep sending.

You keep your enlivened position. I was just talking to Hansadutta about the good fortune of America, that Krishna consciousness is there and if you can cover the whole America with Krishna consciousness that will be good for the whole world.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
