Dear Sir,

In continuation of my letter dated 7th September 1969 dispatched from my German center, I beg to inform you further that Messrs. INDO CRAFTER is going to supply goods as per copy of the proforma invoice enclosed. They will submit the shipping documents by the end of October, 1969, and you shall pay them the amount from the $700 and odds fund ($300 and odds previously, and $400 sent on 3rd September). The total value of the two invoices comes to Rs. 4,800 (Rs. 2,200 and Rs. 2,600), which approximately in dollar value comes to $640. So kindly arrange to pay this amount and the documents may be sent to the following address: TITTENHURST PARK, TITTENHURST HOUSE, Ascot, Berkshire, ENGLAND. You may debit the charges to my account.

__IMPORTANT:__ The shipping documents for Los Angeles shall be sent to the following address by registered mail: INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, 1975 So. La Cienega Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90034, USA. The shipping documents for London shall be mailed by registered cover to INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS, 7 Bury Place, WC 1, London, England.

We have received complaint from the Bina Musical Stores that on their inquiry about $400 dispatched from America you have replied in the negative. The $400 was sent by cable on the 3rd September 1969, and before that you received $300 and odds. Then why you should reply them in the negative? For this reply the dispatch is held up and delayed. Kindly inform the immediately in the affirmative so that the consignment may not be delayed. Please reply this letter to my above address. Thanking you in anticipation.

Sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
