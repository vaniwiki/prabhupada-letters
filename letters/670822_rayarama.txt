====== Letter to: Rayarama ======

My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter of 8/17/67, and have noted the contents. Krishna's Janmastami ceremony may be celebrated in the same way as last year. I understand that Acyutananda is coming here on Janmastami Day, but I have received no word from him. Anyway, if he comes it will be a great joy for us. You will see in the letter to Brahmananda that any student who comes here for studying further in K.C. will have no difficulty for room, board, and tuition. It is a good opportunity for our students, and I shall be very glad to learn how many of you desire to come. In the meantime, I am trying to get other facilities for passage. Please give your primary attention for improving BTG, the backbone of our movement. Kirtanananda is going to be the first sannyasa among my disciples. I am improving gradually. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Hello Prabhus:\\
I am thanking Krishna that I am now in good health, and enjoying Vrindaban to the fullest. I have seen so many beautiful temples-but unfortunately most of them are in very bad state of repair. We are hoping (hopeing) to get one of them for our society quarters here; I know it would be nice for you all, and I think it would be a great service to the Lord. You will be interested to know that Swamiji has initiated a very wonderful Indian boy here as our first Indian brahmachari, and he is now assisting His Divine Grace personally in every way. His name is Dinesh.

love, Kirtanananda
