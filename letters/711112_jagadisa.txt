My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter, no date, and have noted the contents carefully.

This college program and school work you are doing is very encouraging to hear. In these schools try to get as many classes as possible. This traveling Sankirtana is very good; to go from village to village as Lord Caitanya has predicted.

Yes, if you think Suzanne Boase is a suitable partner for Hiranyagarbha, then they have my blessings.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
