My dear Nari devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. The problems you write of indicate that your spiritual foundation is very weak. To make advancement in Krsna consciousness one must decide whether he is going to be serious or not. If one is actually serious, then by chanting Hare Krsna 16 rounds daily, following the four regulative principles, and reading my books, certainly you will make advancement, and these such problems will fall to the side. I therefore request you because you are an initiated devotee to take up Krsna consciousness seriously as you promise at the time of your initiation, and be happy in Krsna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
