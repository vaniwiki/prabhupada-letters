====== Pradyumna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much satisfied with your transliteration and request you to transliterate the 2nd Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the original text is sent herewith. Please find. On your completion of the transliteration, the original copy may be sent directly to the following address: Hitsaran Sharma, Radha Press, 993/3 Main Road, Gandhi Nagar, Delhi 31, India with the covering letter as follows:

"Dear Sharmaji,

Please accept my respectful obeisances. Under instructions from Our Spiritual Master, His Divine Grace, Sri Srimad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaja, I am sending herewith the transliteration of the 2nd Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam with diacritic marks. Kindly insert this transliteration in place of simple transliteration which is already with you. Swamiji has already requested you to collect some letters with diacritic marks and we wish you will kindly do the needful. Hope you are well. Thanking you in anticipation."

One carbon copy of the transliteration may be sent to me with a carbon copy of the covering letter to Hitsaran Sharma. The composition of the Second Canto is already begun. Therefore, the more quickly you send the transliteration to the above press is better.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
