<card class="letter">
My dear Mukunda,

Yesterday I have sent you a personal note on the request of Vinod Kumar. If immigration Visa's burdensome for the Society, then don't take the risk. I think to get immigration Visa is very difficult and therefore you may not unnecessarily involve the society in it. __We cannot pay him any salary at the present moment__ or unless we see his talents, I shall let you know later on more about it. Hope you are well.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
