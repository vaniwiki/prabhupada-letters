====== Letter to: Sri N. Tombi Singh ======

Sri N. Tombi Singh, M.P.\\

108 South Avenue\\
New Delhi

Dear Sri Singh,

I have received a letter from the Manipur Gita Mandal in Imphal dated August 18, 1975 inviting me and my disciples to Manipur for putting on my programs. I am prepared to go to Manipur with 6 or 7 or my European and Indian disciples in April, 1976. So if you can arrange for my going there, I am prepared.

Thanking you,

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
