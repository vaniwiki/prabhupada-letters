====== Madhudvisa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 20, 1969 and have read it carefully. The arrangements as stated by you appear very nice. Mulgibar Patel is a nice gentleman, and when he offers $5,000 he can be elected a life trustee of our temple. That is a nice proposal. If the arrangement is successful, then immediately complete the negotiations and purchase the house. I am also glad that Tamala Krishna, Gargamuni and Jayananda also agreed. So it is a good chance, and the best opportunity is that we can keep the three Rathas in the garage. As expressed by you, our Rathayatra Festival in San Francisco must be continued every year with increased gorgeousness. I hope Krishna will bless you. So try to complete this purchase. I have got complete approval.\\
Here everything is going nicely, and we have got our permission to remain in 7 Bury Place, London. In Oxford we are also negotiating for a church, and Sankirtana Party is going very nicely.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
