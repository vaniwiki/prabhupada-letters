====== Letter to: Alan Ginsberg ======

Mr. Alan Ginsberg\\

My dear Ginsberg,

Please accept my blessings. HARE KRISHNA! Mukunda has sent me a copy of the letter you have sent him on Sept. 23, 1968, and I thank you very much for your so much sympathy for this Krishna Consciousness movement. And Krishna will certainly bestow His Mercy upon you, and I pray that you will live long for chanting HARE KRISHNA continuously. Hope this will find you all right in your health and other things.

Yours ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
