My dear Govinda dasi,

Please accept my blessings and the blessings of Lord Caitanya also. Because you have done the Caitanya Mahaprabhu murti so wonderfully, I can understand that Caitanya Mahaprabhu had a special blessing upon you. So you first introduced Tulasi plant in the Western countries and now you have introduced the vigraha form of Lord Caitanya in the Western countries. So do it very nicely and very soon I shall be coming to your New Navadvipa by the month of March or April.

The Panca-tattva can all be golden. The Deity of Lord Caitanya is very nicely done so there is no need to change the color. Yes, Srivas Pandit has sikha. Vaisnava must have sikha. Advaita Prabhu has a full white beard. He was an old man. He was practically older than the father of Lord Caitanya. He was an elder gentleman in the town of Navadvipa, elder of the brahmana community. All should wear Tulasi kunti beads, not less than two strands. Three, four strands or my Guru Maharaja had five strands. Only Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda wear crowns and nosepins. Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda can be decorated with all kinds of jewelry. For Krishna Tulasi and Rama Tulasi the the worship is the same. There is no difference between Rama and Krishna. Both are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Simply they are expansions of the same Absolute Truth.

This is very good that these leaders of this local yoga group have joined with us. This is great credit. All the hippie groups can be transformed into Krishna Consciousness by your regular preaching. You have already experienced that our transcendental mantra of Hare Krishna and distribution of prasadam will make us successful all over the world. Those who are intelligent can read our books very seriously and their lives will become perfect. Our method is very simple. The preacher should also be ideal, sincere, serious and strictly adhering to our principles, chanting 16 rounds and following the restrictive rules.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
