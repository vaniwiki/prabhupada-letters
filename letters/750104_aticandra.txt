My dear Aticandra dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 16th, 1974 and have noted the contents. I think your idea is a little utopian. First thing is that one must understand Srimad-Bhagavatam fully. The first verse, if you simply explain, will take volumes and volumes. So, please study my books intensely and do not fail to chant 16 rounds daily following the four regulative principles strictly. This will make everything perfect.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
