My dear Lokanatha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21st inst. I am also happy to hear your very nice activities. I wish I could have joined you. I like your program very much. If you continue this program you will be benefited, people will be benefited, and everyone will be happy.

If possible you can collect something for our Gurukula and Temple also, and if some high-class men want to offer their children to Gurukula we can accept.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
