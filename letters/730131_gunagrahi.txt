====== Letter to: Gunagrahi ======

Buffalo

My dear Gunagrahi das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 5, 1973, and I have noted the contents carefully.

Krsna Consciousness means always increasing, so I am glad to see that you are remaining enthusiastic to push on this Krsna Consciousness movement more and more. Your request for initiation is approved by me, and I have sent a letter in this regard. You are president of Buffalo temple, so in consultation with your GBC man you may discuss how to push on the spreading of this Krsna Consciousness movement through street sankirtana, book distribution, etc., whatever is practical for you to follow. In regard to preaching the glories of the Lord there are no hard and fast rules, we must simply always remain ourself fixed in Krsna Consciousness and then Krsna will give us the good guidance how to push things on. So since Rupanuga Maharaja is coming there you may discuss with him. I am desiring now to turn over the management of the society to my disciples, the temple presidents and GBC men especially, so cooperatively you may work out the management details.

Regarding initiation, you may arrange with Kirtanananda Maharaja to receive beads chanted upon by him. I am going now to Australia for a few weeks and shall afterward be returning to India for celebrating the appearance day of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu at Mayapur.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
