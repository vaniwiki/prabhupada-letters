__SUBJECT MATTER:__ Extension of stay in India for my disciples.

Dear

Let me introduce myself as the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In India I am especially present to popularize this Krishna Consciousness movement for awakening God Consciousness of the people in general. They are appreciating it very much. In that connection, I require the helping hand of these foreigners. As far as possible, I have guaranteed their staying in India in the matter of their maintenance and security and still they are being asked to leave the country. I cannot understand what are the legal intricacies in this connection. If you will kindly give me direction how they can stay, it will be very kind of you. I require their help very much in connection with the Hare Krishna Movement.

Thanking you for your cooperation.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
