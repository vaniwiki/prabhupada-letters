My dear Tapana Misra dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your kind donation of $50. Regarding your business, if Jayatirtha and the others give their sanction, then I have no objection. The most important thing is that you must follow all of the rules and regulations very strictly. Then everything will be very nice.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
