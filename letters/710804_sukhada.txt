My dear Sukhada Devi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter undated and delivered personally by Harer Nama Prabhu on 1st August, 1971 at New York. Upon his recommendation and the recommendation of Satsvarupa Prabhu I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple and have given you the spiritual name Sukhada Devi Dasi. __Sukhada means one who is always giving pleasure to Krishna.__ That you can do by engaging in His service 24 hours. Surely then He will be pleased and bestow upon you all blessings for making rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness.

The process is simple. Follow the regulative principles of devotional life undeviatingly, regularly chant 16 rounds of beads daily and without fail, read all our literatures, attend classes and aratis, go for street Sankirtana. If there are any questions, always refer them to your elder godbrothers and sisters. So our method is not so difficult. Rather it is joyful. So engage yourself enthusiastically in this way and you will be happy and in the end go back to home, back to Godhead.

I have chanted on your beads and they were returned to you personally by Harer Nama; you should have received them by now. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
