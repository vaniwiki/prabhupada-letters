====== Aniruddha ======

My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 21, 1969. I am glad that you have received my letter to to you, addressed to New York. Therein I have expressed my opinion about your marriage. So it is very nice program. Just get yourself married, and as you propose to go to Argentina with Citsukhananda to open a branch there, I have all approval. So you accept some girl who will marry you, either Sacidevi or anyone else. In our Indian way there is no question of acceptance or rejection. The parents arrange for marriage and whatever boy or girl they select for their son or daughter, that is accepted. Even there is some disagreement at times, that is not taken very seriously. In this way, in mature life they become happy. I want to introduce this system in the Western countries, amongst my disciples at least. Their primary business should be Krishna Consciousness. Other relationships are mundane and therefore not very important. So please try to open a branch in Argentina, and it is not very difficult. Recently Vamanadeva who was in Columbus, now has married and has ventured on my advice to open a center in St. Louis. I have received his report several days ago, and it is very encouraging.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. The Radha Krishna deity carved from wood by Gaurasundara at San Francisco was delivered to you. Perhaps you remember. I want those deities now. Please let me know where they are.
