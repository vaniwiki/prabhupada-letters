====== Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I have received a letter from Gurukrpa Swami that he has given to DNP on November 26, 1974 Dollars 60,338.98. This money is not yet received here. If you have not sent it to ISKCON MAYAPUR VRINDABAN FUND A/c No. 17168 at First National City Bank, Bombay; then you can send it through Bank of America in favor of ISKCON MAYAPUR VRINDABAN FUND A/c No. 16026, Bank of America Bombay Branch.

Please acknowledge.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
