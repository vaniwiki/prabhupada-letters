====== Nirmal Babu ======

My dear Nirmal Babu,

Please accept my greetings. Since a very long time we are now separated, and I think I met you last at your home sometimes in 1964 before starting for America. Perhaps you have information about my activities in the Western countries and the cult of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu being nicely transplanted in the Western countries.

Sometimes some of our friends donate a pair of Radha Krsna Deities for our different temples, but the Reserve Bank of India takes too much time to sanction the free gift. In this way I am put into great trouble. So I am seeking you help if something can be done that if somebody gives us free gifts of Deities the Government shall not object to it.

Krsna Consciousness Movement is India's original culture. Why the Government should not help in spreading this culture while they are eager to receive it? I hope you will kindly think over this matter and help me.

Hope you are well.

Awaiting your early reply.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
