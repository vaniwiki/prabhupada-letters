My dear Yadunandan dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 12, 1975 and have noted the contents. Now, everything has been rectified. That is good. Please continue executing your Krishna Conscious activities, strictly following all of the rules and regulations carefully. Always remain engaged in the service of Krishna and you will be sublime.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
