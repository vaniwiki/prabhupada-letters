Dear Touati Lakhdar,

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 21, 1975. I am glad to learn of your interest in Krsna consciousness. You should take up this chanting of Hare Krsna mantra very seriously. The devotees in the Frankfurt temple will instruct you how to do it. In this way you can become cured of any mental anxiety. Krsna consciousness is something non-sectarian. It does not depend on Hindu religion or Moslem religion. So if you chant the Lord's name and pray to Him, "What service can I render?", then soon you will advance in Krsna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
