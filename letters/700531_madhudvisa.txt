====== Madhudvisa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil and noted the contents.

Jariwala's letter is not very encouraging. He is prepared to some silver Murtis; Murtis we have already got. Therefore we should not take him for the present very seriously. Later on we shall thank over the matter.

I am very glad to know that work has begun on construction of the Rathas, so see that it is done all very gorgeously.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
