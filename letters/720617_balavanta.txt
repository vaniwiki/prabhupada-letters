My dear Balavanta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 12, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I thank you very much for the nice flower garland you have sent, and the nice fragrance is very pleasing. Beautiful flowers are compared to Krishna smiling.

I am very glad to hear that you are keeping active in the political arena, and if we are able to establish Krishna conscious leaders throughout the country in important posts, we will be able to save everyone from the present dangerous position of the world. People in general are being guided into hellish condition of life by the rascal leaders, so we must establish qualified brahmanas at the head of the society, and widely distribute Krishna conscious principles. So you continue in this way, and Krishna will give you the needed strength and intelligence.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
