====== Nara-narayana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Nara Narayana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter pointing out some of the discrepancies of many of the devotees in New York. You are correct regarding the items which you have stated, such as sleeping in front of the deities, eating in front of the deities, taking of unoffered foodstuffs, drinking water from the bathroom, and non-chanting of rounds. But the thing is discipline can not be observed unless there is obedience. As you are obedient to me, you should be similarly obedient to my representative. Your statement about Brahmananda that he is a wonderful devotee is 100% agreed by me. He is in charge of the New York center, and, therefore, if proper obedience is not given to him it will be impossible for him to manage the affairs of the temple. Under the circumstances, the discrepancies you have observed in the temple may be referred to him, and he is quite reasonable, and will handle the matter with the respective devotees. Please don't you take any direct actions because it will cause disruption. You are a very talented boy, and I have every confidence in you, so I hope you will do this and oblige.

I have seen the plans for New Vrindaban, and I can understand that you have a great talent in house planning also. This will be fully utilized in the matter of our developing our New Vrindaban scheme when I go there. In the meantime, please let me know if you can get some pairs of Radha-Krishna deities in some brass foundry there. This is the immediate important work for you. You have asked in your letter to Purusottama if you should observe the lists of 44 offenses and 44 regulations for deity worship, and the answer is no; there is no need of this for the present.

I will be glad to hear from you by early return mail. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
