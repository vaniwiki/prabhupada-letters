My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of Krsna tape transcriptions #13, 32, and 33, and 34, along with your note from the art department.

Regarding the Vedas personified, they should be drawn just like you have seen some pictures of great sages. They are young in appearance like perfect Vaisnavas, and they may be shown with tilak and Vaisnava markings in that way.

So such pictures are definitely required and please have them execute the subjects appropriately as they have so nicely done thus far.

In the meantime, I hope you have by now received my last letter inviting you to visit L.A. Temple at your earliest convenience, and I shall be very glad to see you then.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
