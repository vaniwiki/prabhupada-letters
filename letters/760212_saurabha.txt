====== Letter to: Saurabha ======

Bombay

My dear Saurabha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of one letter from Gaura Govinda Swami in Puri. In his letter he states that he is ready to submit plans to the municipal authorities. So I am herewith requesting you to send him a plan.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
