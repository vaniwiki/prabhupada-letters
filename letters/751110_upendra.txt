====== Upendra ======

Vrndavana

My dear Upendra das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 10, 1975 and I have read the contents in entirety. So I thank you very much for your sentiments. Why not stick to Vrndavana. I am coming there soon and again we shall associate. Now you should extend your visa and stay there and stick to that holy place. Ultimately Vrndavana is our goal of life.

I am glad to note your program and that you are also studying Hindi. This is very good. I very much appreciate your service. In the kitchen you should please see that nothing is wasted.

Yes, you will be blessed by Vrndavana-Isvari. I am coming there very soon and things will be adjusted.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
