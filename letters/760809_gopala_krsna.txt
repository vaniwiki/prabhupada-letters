====== Gopala Krsna ======

Bombay

My dear Gopala Krsna das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of July 31, which was addressed to Harikesa Maharaja and I have noted the contents. I shall be returning to Bombay from Tehran on Friday the 13.

I have received the color proofs for the books and have noted that it is not as good as the foreign printing. It is missing the luster, but it is not bad.

Regarding Tejiyas and Delhi, I have already said that you should arrange whatever is suitable by mutual agreement.

Yes, you may fix up the life member rooms by investing a little money.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
