====== Karandhara ======

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. We have now decided to take legal proceedings against Nair because we have received one telegram from Tamala Krishna as follows: "Nair unreasonable, settlement impossible, immediately filing criminal and civil suits, letter follows, Tamala Krishna." So I have immediately sent one telegram: "Suing Nair, don't change bonds, repeat, don't change bonds, Syamasundara das." So we have decided for good not to settle, so there is no need to cash the bonds as we shall receive lump-sum dividend by 10th December for at least $3500, so we shall not lose this interest. We may, however, require to change the bonds when we find out a suitable house for M-V Trust. That I shall let you know. In the meantime, keep in safe-deposit box. Later developments I shall let you know.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
