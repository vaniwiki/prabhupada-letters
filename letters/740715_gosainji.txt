====== Gosainji ======

Vrindaban

My dear Gosainji:

Please accept my dandabats and my love for your children and grandchildren and my regards for Ma-gosaini. So I am reaching Vrindaban by the 26th of July, and at that time Panchu may see me and we shall settle up the things so that he can begin his work from the first of August.

We wish to hold a grand festival of the opening of Krishna Balarama temple at Raman Reti. There will be seven days function, and the arrangement has been made that anyone who visits our temple may be supplied with sumptuous prasadam both kachi and pakki. So let Panchu take over this plan and when we meet we shall arrange this plan. Further when we meet at Vrindaban.

With regards, I beg to remain,

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
