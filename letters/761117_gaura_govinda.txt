====== Gaura Govinda ======

Bhuvaneśvara

My dear Gaura Govinda,

Please accept my blessings.

What is the climate like there in Bhuvaneśvara now? I want to come there. I want to begin work immediately on constructing a temple exactly like Jagannatha's temple in Puri. You can immediately begin to get estimates from contractors. It will be a very important temple.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. What is the progress with the land registration?\\
