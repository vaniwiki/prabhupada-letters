My dear Abhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 16, 1972, and I have noted the contents. Yes, you may install either the Jagannatha deities, the Panca-tattva, or, if you are very serious to engage in deity worship program, you may have both, according to the direction and advice of your GBC man. But this deity worship is very serious program, and it must be kept to the utmost highest standard and never allowed to be neglected. So if you are willing and able to initiate such program in Baltimore center, I have no objection.

Similarly, I have no objection to the marriage between Sruta das and Samista dasi, if the GBC man has approved. In future instances, if the GBC man is in agreement to marry, you need not consult me in the matter, as I have now handed over all such questions to them for deciding.

Hope this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
