====== Anandini (Karen Anderson) ======

Philadelphia

My dear Anandini Devi Dasi (Karen Anderson),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14th January, 1971 as well as the $50.00 gift sent by you also. Thank you very much. I am so glad to accept you as my disciple. Your spiritual name is Anandini Devi Dasi; Anandini means "pleasure." Your beads are also duly enclosed and to keep them strong they should be soaked in oil; mustard oil will do. Also they should be restrung properly.

I am so glad to hear how nicely you are engaged in devotional service there in our Philadelphia temple, under the expert guidance of Nayana Bhirama. I have received so many favorable reports about the activities there in Philadelphia and am so glad that you are there also and helping out. As the temple is growing more and more, so can your service expend also. So stay strong in Krishna's service by strictly following the regulative principles, chanting 16 rounds daily, without fail, reading all our literatures, and engaging whole-heartedly in devotional service, 24 hours. Then you will be happy and Krishna will be pleased.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
