====== Letter to: Sridama ======

Miami

My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 26, 1972 and I have noted the contents. Always there will be obstacles placed in our path by the demons and atheists, but if we can remain pure, nothing will be able to stop this great transcendental movement from spreading God consciousness all over the world. So as president, you must make sure that all the students are regularly chanting 16 rounds, taking bath, attending mangal aratrik, reading our books, and following the regulative principles. If everyone keeps strictly these principles then success is assured.

So far South Africa, I think it is not possible for go there now. Better you concentrate your efforts to organize Miami center nicely.

I am enclosing three copies of Gayatri mantra and two sacred threads, and you can hold a fire yajna for Dharma, Rohini, and Ragavendu. Satsvarupa has a tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra so you can get this from him. One thing is that the tape should be heard through earphones into the right ear.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
