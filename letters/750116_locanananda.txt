====== Letter to: Locanananda ======

Paris

My dear Locanananda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 31st, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your ideas are good and are surely worth considering. I have discussed them with Bhagavan das and he also thinks that it may be possible to unify Europe in this way. So, Bhagavan should be going back to Europe in a couple of weeks and we shall see how things are working out there.

Please keep yourself fixed up in Krishna Consciousness by strictly adhering to all the rule and regulations. Always be sure to chant 16 rounds and study my books daily. This will keep you strong in spiritual life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
