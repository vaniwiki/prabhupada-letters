====== Gargamuni ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. Regarding the land in Vrindaban, Mr. Sarif has promised but he has not given, so forget that proposition. Enclosed find the copy of a letter to Gauracandra Goswami. Deliver it to him, and if Gauracandra replies me in writing, then we can consider that possibility. Then we can take the matter seriously.

Regarding Brahma Kunda, the donor Dinabandhu is going to give it to us in pukkha writing or legal form by the 15th January, and then we can repair that house to our living, making the doors, etc. secure. In the meantime you can use my Radha-Damodara rooms, but make the locks and doors secure.

As for municipal land, see the municipal chairman personally. We wanted land within the city. In the meantime, you can show the chairman the enclosed pictures from "Dharma Yug" magazine, latest issue, how we are a worldwide organization, as well as other clippings from Toronto, etc. So far our devotees, Americans are concerned, they have nothing to do with politics. We are %%___%% Nixons. A statement was issued by me and published in %%____%% papers stating this fact and calling on the Indian %%_____%% my disciples as Vaisnavas, who are above all mundane. %%____%%.

I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Regarding land on the Yamuna-side, if there is flood, it will be difficult to be there. They wanted to give %%____%% 4 acres near the Town Hall. Give a copy of your %%____%% to me. Make inquiry why my letter was not received at Vrindaban P.O. I am sending the receipt.\\
