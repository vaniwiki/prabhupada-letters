====== Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I hope that everything is going on well there with the production of Bhagavad-gita. In this regards please make the following addition to the text:

Chapter IX, The Most Confidential Knowledge, in the purport of the 34th verse you will read "Krishna is not an ordinary human being; He is the Absolute Truth, His Body, Mind and He Himself are One and Absolute". Immediately therefore you can add the following: In the Kurma Purana, as it is quoted by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami in his Anubhasya comments of Caitanya Caritamrta, 5th chapter Ādi lila, verses 41-48, "deha dehi bibhedo 'yang nesvare vidyate kvacit" which means that there is no difference in Krishna, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body.

This evidence is given here to show that there is no distinction between Krishna's body and Himself since such commentators as Dr. Radhakrishnan make such distinction.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
