====== Hayagriva ======

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 19, and have noted the contents. I am very much pleased by your renewed and serious efforts to help me in my service to my Guru Maharaja. Please continue in this attitude and Krishna will save you, you need have no doubt.

Regarding your question as to obtain a house or a storefront for holding kirtanas, I think that you may use your own good discretion as to which will be most effective in popularizing Krishna Consciousness in Ohio.

Now that you will be coming to visit me soon, we shall discuss your plans of marriage. I think this is a good idea and you will require a wife who is an expert typist to be your secretary. Such a wife with good typing ability will be a great asset in your writing activities. So when you arrive we can discuss this further.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please try to finish up 1st and 2nd Cantos of Bhagavatam as soon as possible.
