====== Letter to: Gabhira ======

Washington, D.C.

My dear Gabhira das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one article from Rupanuga entitled, "Officials approve Krishna Ministry". Thank you very much. We have succeeded by Krishna's blessing. Now do it nicely. It is a great stride. We can start in other places, too.

In your office you can hang a nice picture of the Panca Tattva done by a good artist, or a sankirtana picture.

I am also recognized as an ordained minister by the immigration authorities.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
