====== Hrdayananda ======

Buenos Aires

My dear Hrdayananda das Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter dated October 13, 1975 addressed to all GBC's. Brahmananda is accused, but I shall explain that Pusta Krishna Swami since the last three years was trying for my visa, so out of natural compassion for him I thought let me go to South Africa and come back before sitting down tightly. He was expecting me for a very long time, and South Africa is a strict place in the matter of visa and so on. After going there I was very much satisfied with how my movement is being received there. After my lecture in the University the Europeans clapped and they were very enthusiastically purchasing my books.

Now I have come back, so let me stay in India. I will remain in Bombay, Vrindaban, and Mayapur. As you have desired, now let me do that, to sit down tightly and concentrate on the translating business. But, if you disturb me, then my mind will be disturbed. I want that what I have established may go on nicely, but I see that some of the devotees are reviving their old "good" qualities. That is the difficulty. If the old habits come back, then everything is finished. If my mind becomes disturbed in this way, then how can I concentrate on book writing. It is not possible. Better not to inform me anything, and let me sit in Vrindaban.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
