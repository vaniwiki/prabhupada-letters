====== Prahladananda ======

Austin, Texas

My dear Prahladananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7/13/72, and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. I am so glad to hear that the things in Austin center are going on very nicely, never mind there are not many devotees there. Our program is to enlist the men with quality for serving Krishna, not for attracting the masses for simply watching and going away. As long as the classes are going on well, the rules and regulations are being observed sincerely, the sankirtana party is going out with enthusiastic mood---if these things are going on, then everything is first-class. You are engaged in Krishna's preaching work, therefore you are being specially favored by Krishna, just like the fighting soldier is receiving all special care by the government so that he will not be lacking anything, even the citizens at home may be deprived of all comforts. So you may know it for certain that Krishna will give you all facility to improve in every way, according to the sincerity of your attempt to spread Krishna Consciousness in the battlefield of preaching work.

Upon your recommendation I am glad to accept Dorian as my duly initiated disciple. I am sending his beads, duly chanted by me, under separate post. His new spiritual name shall be Dharmabhavana das Brahmacari. His letter follows.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
