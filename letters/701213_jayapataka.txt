Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th December, 1970.

You write to say, "We notice that even the communist protestors can't help smiling and answering back 'Hari Bol!' " So there is sufficient hope to reform them by Caitanya Mahaprabhu's grace of chanting the Hare Krsna Mantra. Kali Yuga is the fallen age undoubtedly, and there are different varieties of fallen souls. In Calcutta the so-called disturbance-makers are also some of them. I went to America and some of the souls were accepted by Lord Caitanya and today the Bengal being Lord Caitanya's place they are in such pitiable condition, so I wish that some of you among my American disciples may try to reclaim these fallen souls to the order of Lord Caitanya's Vaisnavite platform.

When I was in Calcutta, many Naxalite and Communist youths used to see me. They were arguing with me, but I defeated them smilingly. They left after offering me their respects. I think they can also be reformed provided we diagnose and administer the proper medicine for them. I am not very much hopeless about Calcutta situation or even if there is some risk we should try to reform them and if we are successful, the people of India will hail us to great estimation and adoration and that will give us good impetus for pushing on our Movement, Krsna Consciousness.

Although there are many places in Calcutta we can have at cheap price, my advice is that you try to raise this one lakh of rupees for advancing to the Hamilton people and keep it ready. I have already sent you a telegram reading like the following: "If they accept 6.2 lakhs, I will immediately go there to complete transaction." So, if the Hamilton people accept the offer of Rs 620,000/, I shall immediately go and finish the transaction. I hope you have received the telegram and I am expecting your reply at any moment. The location of the Hamilton House is very nice and absolutely suitable for our purposes. In the meantime, I am also addressing one letter to the Hamilton Co. and the copy of which is enclosed herewith. Please do the needful. Keep yourself brave and fit to face the situation with faith in Krsna and Spiritual Master. Let us do something tangible in Calcutta.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
