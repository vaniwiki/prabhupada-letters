====== Gunagrahi ======

Los Angeles

My dear Gunagrahi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your request for initiations.

Now hold a fire sacrifice for these devotees. Make sure they know the four regulative principles and follow them strictly. They must also chant at least 16 rounds per day avoiding the ten offenses. Ramesvara Maharaja chant on the beads of the first initiates. Play the tape of Me chanting the Gayatri mantra into the right ear of the second initiates. Teach them how to chant on the finger divisions.

The names of the new initiates are as follows:

Enrique Ross---Yogananda dasa

Felipe Musquiz---Padmalocan dasa

Peter Tapp---Purusa dasa

Richard Warfield---Raktaka dasa

Heather O'Neil---Harsarani dasi

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

note: the second initiates names are: Ramanya dasa, Parasakti dasi\\
