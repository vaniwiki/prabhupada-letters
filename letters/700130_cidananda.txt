====== Cidananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28 January, 1970.

Herewith, I am returning back the new beads duly chanted. The former beads may be kept with you and if some new boy comes and wants to chant, you may lend him the beads---not to be taken away by him, but to be used for chanting while he is in the Temple. Otherwise, you can keep them carefully and they may be used in some emergency.

I am so glad to learn that everything is progressing nicely in Vancouver, and you are proposing to sell 2500 BTGs per month. That is very much encouraging. You will be glad to know that we have now published our book, "Isopanisad," and I have mentioned your good name therein, acknowledging your contribution towards my book fund.

In my book fund, not only my disciples are contributing, but also others who are outsiders like Mr. George Harrison who has contributed the entire cost of publishing my book Krishna---the cost will be $19,000. Now we have got our press and we propose to publish many books. Also, attempt is being made in Hamburg for translating all our literatures into French and German languages and to publish them regularly.

So with increase of our activities by Sankirtana Movement if possible, try to save some money for my book fund.

Please offer my blessings to Ananda, Rudra das, Ravindra das and our new friend, Mr. John.

All glories to the Assembled devotees

Be happy and chant Hare Krishna Mantra.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
