====== Letter to: Murlidhar ======

My dear Murlidhar,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 28, 1969, and I have very much appreciated your painting of Lord Nrisingadeva. If possible, paint similar pictures for other temples. I am also glad to learn that you are painting Radha-Krishna painting. You have mentioned a picture of Krishna and the Gopies, without Radha-rani cannot be. If you mean to say the picture of Radha-Krishna and the eight Gopies, then that is all right. I do not know what is this Krishna with the Gopies. There are many unauthorized pictures painted by so-called called imaginative artists, but we don’t want such pictures in our temples. So you kindly send me a sketch of the picture, and I shall see whether it is authorized. I am very glad that Devahuti has finished a picture of Radha-Krishna, and that she is working also on Lord Caitanya and Sankirtan. I am also glad that you combinedly want to paint a picture of my photograph. I prefer the picture which was published in our __Back To Godhead__ #18, page 32. It is written there “Your ever well-wisher,”. Another thing is please send me the reproduction of the picture which you made for __Bhagavat__ cover. The Macmillan Company is going to publish our __Bhagavatam, __and I shall give them the picture for the dust cover.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
