====== Letter to: Bhutatma ======

San Francisco

My dear Bhutatma,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter and enclosed photographs of the Ratha Yatra Festival. If we introduce this Festival in all big cities of the world along side with book distribution then in no time we will conquer the whole world. Yes! Certainly I shall come to your festival next year, thank you.

By your recommendation I have chanted upon the enclosed sacred thread and agree to accept the devotee Jambavan Das Brahmacari for second initiation %%__%% becomes twice born, or Brahmin. The qualifications of a Brahmana are listed in the 18th Chapter verse 42 of the Bhagavad-gita. "Peacefulness, self control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness---these are the qualities by which the Brahmanas work". So you should be very much careful to see that our devotees are following the regulative principles and standard practices such as attending morning Arati, classes, Sankirtana, and reading our books. We want to create some men who can give guidance to the human society, because at the present moment the society is without any intelligent head, namely Brahmins, therefore the whole world is confused for want of real guidance in the matter of ultimate goal of life. They have taken sense gratification as the ultimate goal and therefore everyone is frustrated, because the living entity has nothing to do with the temporary material senses. The senses will never be satisfied, Krishna must be satisfied and then the living entity as eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord is automatically satisfied. So the Brahmins are supposed to serve the whole society by distributing this important information. Please help me in this way and Krishna will bless you.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
