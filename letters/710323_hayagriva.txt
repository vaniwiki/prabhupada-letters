My Dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife Shamadasi and your brave son Samba. I was very glad to hear from you and the news that you have expanded our New Vrndavana scheme by purchasing the land on the opposite ridge is most encouraging. Certainly if you require to borrow two or three thousand dollars to pay for this, I shall do the needful.

I remember very well that land and now you can put into effect my suggestion for a bridge, specifically a cable car bridge. If it is placed part way down the hillside where the slope becomes very steep, that will make the distance shorter from one side to the other. In the meantime, I have already made one suggestion to Kirtanananda Maharaja that a broad stairway may be made descending from the road and rising again to New Vrndavana. That will also be very nice. Now I am looking forward to returning there again. It will be very, very good if you can also acquire the other adjoining lands. So do it expediently and for the details you can consult with other GBC members. That will be nice.

I have read your article, "Constitution of the Soul." It is very nice. Such articles with scientific observation should be published in BTG. But one thing, I am drawing the attention of all the GBC that London affairs are not going very nicely. Of course it is improved since Mukunda has taken charge. The GBC should keep watch over London affairs. It is one of the most important centers of ISKCON. I have already paid $20,000 to Dai Nippon on "Back to Godhead" account on the 16th of March 1971, to save the crisis. Their debt was $52,000; now reduced to $32,000. The procedure should be that you get 200,000 copies and collect at least $0.25 a piece although the price marked is $0.50. This will yield $50,000. $13,000 will go the cost of printing (balance $36,000); $5,000 towards the old debt (balance $31,000). The remainder of $31,000 to be distributed proportionately to the centers or if possible contributed to the Book Fund. The GBC should immediately take up this management as suggested by me and then there will be no difficulty. The first four installments of $5,000 for paying debts shall go to my Book fund to pay off the loan and from the fifth installment shall be directed to Dai Nippon for paying the old debt.

I am very glad to learn how Pittsburgh Temple is developing. Pittsburgh is a nice city and if you organize a nice temple it will be a great success. I have already sent to you the purports for B.G. Chapter 9, verses 16-25, 27 (no 26). I will send the purport to verse 28 very soon. So far the index is concerned, speed it as far as possible; I am very anxious to print. The index is printed at the last stage, still try to finish it quickly.

Yes, as soon as I return to the States, I must come there. I always think of Vrndavana. Now Krsna has given us a nice front portion and it is a great favor from the Lord.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
