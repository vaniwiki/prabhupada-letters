My dear Bahudak,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 21, 1974 and have noted the contents.

I am very glad to hear about your new farm-asrama existing there. We want to develop many such farms all over the world. Your are enthusiastic and intelligent and it appears that you are managing in nicely. Why not call it New Gokula instead of New Mayapur. I think that is better. It is alright that you have purchased machinery and are using on the farm but if you can do without as much as possible that is better. It sounds as if the living conditions there may be a little extreme. But if the devotees can learn to tolerate as you say they are determined, and can stay and work there that is very good. And I give all encouragement to them.

Krishna says in the __Bhagavad-gita,__ Ch. 2, text 14; __matra-sparsas tu kaunteya, sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah, agamapayino 'nityas, tams titiksasva bharata__ [[books:bg:2:14|(Bg. 2.14)]] O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed. So remember Krishna's instructions in the __Bhagavad-gita__ and continue to work with all enthusiasm and encourage the others also to do the same.

As far as you opening a local Gurukula program there, I have no objection if it can be done nicely. So consult with Satsvarupa Maharaja for further instructions.

To develop a farm community such as the one you are doing, it requires much hard work and endurance. But if you work sincerely then Krishna will give you all facilities and men. Therefore continue working and follow the good example that the devotees in New Vrndavana have set and everything will go very nicely. If you have any specific questions you can refer to New Vrndavana and they may be able to help you.

Upon your recommendation I have accepted the following as my disciples, and their names are as follows; Doug---Daksina das, Robert---Ranjita das, Margie---Madhumati devi dasi; Danny---Dharmarupa das, Sharon---Subhavrata devi dasi. Their beads may be chanted on by Kirtanananda Swami or Tamala Krsna Goswami.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
