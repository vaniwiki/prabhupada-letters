My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept by blessings and offer the same to all devotees. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 13, 1967. I am surprised to note that still meetings and negotiations are going on while our money is arrested. I do not know what short of business is this, if the negotiations are not complete while Mr, Taylor is so unscrupulous how this transaction can be terminated I do not know. If Mr. Taylor is receiving cash money what is his further demand I cannot imagine. I guess there is some defect in the whole manipulation. However we are completely dependent on Krishna and let us see what does He desires. There are so many gentlemen involved in this negotiation and all of them are Americans so I have nothing to say in this matter. And what about Mr. Kallman? Still he is manufacturing records? I shall be glad to hear about him. Please offer him my regards.

And we have another Mr. Ypslantin. Mr. Goldsmith suggested that he would take $200.00 and we have already paid him $300,00 and still he wants $150.00. But we need immediately permanent visa. Without it I think I cannot go to Canada because as soon as I leave the border of U.S.A. the bill pending in the congress on my behalf will be automatically cancelled. So I will have to take new Visa from Canada for entering USA of which we cannot say any thing what they will decide. In any case I will have to go to Canada by the end of April as it is already arranged and if it is possible to get the permanent residence Visa. I think we may pay Mr. Ypslantin further $150.00. If not then I do not know what to do. Better consult our other Lawyer friends. What can I advice more. Man's artificial civilisation has created so many artificial laws that we, although God's men, have difficulties to travel in God's countries on God's business. The foolish law makers should have at least given us some facilities to make people Krishna conscious so that they might be happy in this life and in the next. The Kingdom of Maya is like that and still we have to execute our business in Krishna Consciousness.

Regarding Tilak I give you permission for the interested friends.
