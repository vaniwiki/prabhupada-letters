My dear Ganesa dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 21st, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the $200 (Australia) and your kind sentiments. From your letter, I can understand that you are reading my books nicely and understanding our philosophy. This is wanted. By reading my books carefully, you will become enthused to distribute them more and more in greater quantities. If you continue in this way being very much determined to achieve success in this lifetime, following all the rules, chanting at least 16 rounds, and reading my books, then all of your desires to advance in Krishna Consciousness will be fulfilled and you will surely attain spiritual perfection and be able to go Back to Godhead, very soon.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
