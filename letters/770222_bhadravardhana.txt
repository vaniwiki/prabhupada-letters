Dear Bhadravardhana das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your undated letter along with enclosure of the manuscript of “Analysis of Bhagavad-gita, as well as a fifty dollar check, and I thank you very much.

What I have heard of your compilation of my “Analysis” is well done. It is a good summary for study of Bhagavad-gita. I am having my personal GBC secretary scrutinize it more closely with the idea of presenting it to the BBT Trustees for publication, as you suggested. As for your idea to publish the Brahma Samhita with word for word translations, send me the manuscript for inspection. Thank you very much for so carefully studying my books. If you can actually understand the verses and purports of the Bhagavad-gita As It Is then your spiritual understanding is complete, without any other literature.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
