Dear Kuladri,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 28 and studied the contents.

As for mailing me sweets wherever I am, don't spend unnecessarily. Here they are also preparing them nicely. Now all my disciples are learning this art. Distribute your sweets to newcomers so they will become attracted.

As for the Salagrams, send one to L.A. and you keep one. Simply decorate the salagram and put Him on a sringhasana, apply garland, chandan and tulasi. Salagram Sila bathing means to bathe all the deities. Enclosed fine one note from Jananivas; follow his instructions.

As for bringing sweets and ghee to Mayapur festival, this is very nice. In this way everyone can enjoy the effects of cow protection.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
