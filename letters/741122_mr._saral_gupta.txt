My dear Sri SK Das Gupta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated 11/10/74 and I have noted the contents. I am very glad to note that you are taking active interest in our Krishna Consciousness Movement and are helping to preach this philosophy. Our movement is not a passive movement but it is active. We are trying to awaken the sleeping humanity to reawaken themselves to Krishna Consciousness. At present humanity by and large is working simply for sense gratification. This is to be considered illusion. Actual life is devotional service to the Supreme Lord. By this devotional service one can become perfect and not become a cat or a dog. Please continue to take interest in our movement and read our books and chant Hare Krishna.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
