====== Misses Sarna daughters ======

<card class="letter">
Bombay

My dear Misses Sarna daughters,

Please accept my blessings. I understand you all of a sudden have gone to Bombay, and without the permission of your parents. So your father called me on phone this morning, I could not attend but I was informed by Syamasundara it is something about you. Anyway, take my advice that women, girls, until married, must be under the guidance and protection of the father. That is Vedic civilization. Under the circumstances, I request you both to go back to your father immediately. If there is any disagreement, you can settle up personally, but you cannot disobey your father.

The Nairobi Temple is there, you can attend all the aratis and kirtanas there and assist if there is deity worship going on, so there is no difficulty. It is not good if there is family disturbance in this way, so best thing is you shall go there at once and live peacefully and think always of Krishna under all circumstances.

Hoping this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
