West Coast Presidents

My dear Devotee Presidents:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 21, 1975 with enclosures. This is very bad. These reports about Japan are coming from all over the world. This is very disturbing to me. Their own original face is coming out. This is not at all good. Now you have to do what you have to do to rectify the situation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
