====== Letter to: Bhaja Hari ======

My dear Bhaja Hari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your encouraging report and I thank you very much for it.

Yes, we can make rapid advancement in the company of devotees, if we leave the company of devotees then again we become rogues and rascals. Krsna is providing everyone, and certainly if we work in the company of other sincere devotees He will provide us the best facility.

The schedule you have outlined is satisfactory. Yes, that is the sign of advancement, the surrendering process, that you wanted to take up more responsibility so Krsna has blessed you with more service. I think you made a good choice for a new centre, especially with the response of all the young people there. Now you must seriously strive to make some good devotees and make sure the devotees already with you are chanting their rounds, attending Mangala arti etc, and the enthusiasm will continue increasing.

So now you can write regular reports to your GBC man, Shyamsundar prabhu, and regularly seek his good advice. In this way I am depending on the GBC and the Temple Presidents to free me for important work in the Srimad Bhagavatam. I will just give you the books, now you distribute them to the people, that is the system. So distribute my books widely, train up first class preachers, keep the regulated principles and I will be very pleased and Krsna will bless you more and more.

I hope this meets you in good health.\\
Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
