====== Sudama ======

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13 November, 1969 and have noted the contents. Sriman Tamala Krishna das Brahmacari is staying now in London, and I have already handed him your letter for necessary action in the matter of sending more men there. He will also directly correspond with you. In the meantime, I may inform you that Bali Mardan also wrote me to the effect for changing your headquarters to Tokyo, and I have already confirmed this idea. From the very beginning I wanted to open a branch in Tokyo because when I was in Tokyo on my way to the States from India, I saw it exactly a duplicate city like New York. So another feature I note from your letter is that the Hare Krishna Mantra is being chanted by some Japanese boys. Sometimes back Syamasundara showed me one picture from a Japanese music paper about our Hare Krishna Mantra. So I think Hare Krishna Mantra is already known to the Japanese youngsters. If you take this opportunity in cooperation with them, I am sure it will be successful. I am glad they are offering you free residential quarters at least for one month. That is a good opportunity. In the meantime, find out a nice suitable temple. We shall send you men from here, you are already 3 there, and if you can induce some of the Japanese boys to join you, surely it will be a grand success. Do it carefully and nicely.

Please offer my blessings to Cintamani and Bali-Mardan. I hope this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
