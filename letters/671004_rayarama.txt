====== Letter to: Rayarama ======

My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very interesting letter dated 27 Sept. along with Brahmananda's. When I receive letters from you and Brahmananda immediately I feel new energy. I thank you very much as much as Mr. Kallman for improving our BTG. Krishna has entrusted you with a nice responsibility for improving the quality & quantity of BTG. I am very happy that since it is entrusted to you the things are improving. This means that Krishna is giving you more & more facilities. Krishna is such a nice boss that he gives more facilities & improvement to the sincere servant. From the very beginning of your meeting with me you have very sincerely & honestly carried out my orders & I am so much obliged to you for your simple and plain behavior. Kindly continue this attitude & advise all your God-brothers to do so & they will be happy consequently I shall also be happy. Please guide your innocent God-sisters who have come to our shelter. Girls are more susceptible to the finer attack of maya. Boys are a little stronger in getting out of the intricacies of Maya. Mrinalini, Jadurani & all other girls who are so qualified, good-looking, intelligent, educated & seriously engaged in Krishna Consciousness, should always be give protection from the attack of maya. In my philosophy there is no abstinence from sex life but K.C. should teach us that sex life is the cause of us becoming conditioned to the material nature. Therefore advanced Krishna Consciousness student should know it well that sex life also should be dovetailed with Krishna consciousness. Better to avoid it; if not possible, to have in a regulated married life. But in all circumstances, our primary necessity is to advance in K.C. I am glad that you are training Jagadananda to become my personal secretary as well as you are training Mr. Phil to translate our thoughts to German. Please keep this boy with great care because Krishna has sent him to help us. It is a good combination. Janardana is well acquainted with French, Hayagriva & you with English & Mr. Phil is well acquainted with German. So combinedly you can perform great blitz for bombarding the Western World with Krishna philosophy. This I wanted & Krishna is sending my good lieutenants. I was under the impression that you were in Boston so I have sent you some letters there. Anyway please send to my Calcutta address by air mail some Prospectus, BTG & stationery. I am going to Calcutta on the 9th. The address is on the envelope.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
