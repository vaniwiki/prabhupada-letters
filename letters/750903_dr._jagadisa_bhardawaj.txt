Dear Sriman Bharadwajji:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your presentation of two books, __Krishna Lila he Lila Varnanani__ and __Krishna Lila Vimarsa.__ I have gone through some of the pages of these books. It is done very scholarly. We are presenting Krishna consciousness all over the world. In future many devotees will be interested to read your books. We understand from the Srimad-Bhagavatam that everyone should utilize his talent in the service of the uttamasloka, Krishna.

> idam hi pumsas tapasah srutasya va
> svitasya suktasya ca buddhi dattayeh
> avicyute 'rthah kavibhir nirupite
> yad uttama sloka gunanuvarnanam

Learned circles have positively concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, namely austerities, study of the Vedas, sacrifice, chanting of hymns and charity, culminates in the transcendental descriptions of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry." [[books:sb:1:5:22|(Bhag. 1.5.22)]]

Generally it is very difficult to understand Krishna tattvatah, as it is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita, __manusyanam saharasresu/ kascid yatati siddhaye/ yatatam api siddhanam/ kascin mam vetti tattvatah.__ "Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth." [[books:bg:7:3|(Bg. 7.3)]] But, Krishna is available through the process of devotional service, bhakti yoga, __bhaktya mam abhijanati__ [[books:bg:18:55|(Bg. 18.55)]], and anyone who actually understands about Krishna, about His appearance and disappearance, he goes back to home, Back to Godhead, __janma karma ca me divyam/ evam yo vetti tattvatah/ tyaktva deham punar janma/ naiti mam eti so 'rjuna__ [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]]. Therefore in the Brahma Samhita we learn: __vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma bhaktau__ [Bs. 5.33]. It is further stated in the __Padma Purāṇa__: __atah sri krsna namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih/ sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah__ [Brs. 1.2.234]. "No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality, and pastimes of Sri Krishna through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality, pastimes of the Lord revealed to him." Krishna cannot be known by the materially blunt senses. When you utilize your tongue in the service of the Lord then Krishna reveals Himself. You cannot order Krishna please come and I will see you.

So you are a learned scholar, and you have tried to use your energy for the service of the Lord. That is your success. I thank you very much for your endeavor in spreading Krishna consciousness.

With my best regards, I beg to remain,

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
