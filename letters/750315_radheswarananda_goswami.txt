My dear Sri Radheswarananda Goswami,

Please accept my humble dandavats. I thank you very much for your letter dated Feb. 8th, 1975. I am now on world tour. I left Bombay on Jan. 24th, 1975 and traveled to Hong Kong, Japan, Hawaii, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Caracas, Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, New York, London, and now I am at our Tehran center as above mentioned. And again, I am going back to Bombay tomorrow. So, your proposal is very nice. I wanted to take a party of sankirtana movement all over India, if some of the leaders like you co-operate with us. So, I am reaching Bombay tomorrow and I shall stay there until the 19th. If possible, please come and see me at my Bombay center as follows: Hare Krishna Land, Gandhi Gram Road, Juhu, Bombay 400 054. Or, if the letter does not reach you in time, I am inviting you to come to our festival at Mayapur from the 23rd-27th of March. Then we have also got the opening ceremony for our Vrndavana temple on April 10th, 1975. If it is convenient for you, please try to come and join the ceremonies.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
