Dear Vrindaban,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter in Bengal dated April 9, 1974 and beg to inform you we are still prepared to purchase the house at 72 Mahatma Gandhi Road, according to the terms already given. If the sellers are prepared to sell the house on the same terms we are ready. That is, Rs three lakhs, or Rs 60,000 for each of the five parties. There are five parties, your mother, your third maternal uncles and the other three parties who are resting in the house namely the family of your elder second and last maternal uncle. They can be paid immediately Rs 60,000 each and they must immediately vacate the house on receipt of the money. This has been already informed to you a year ago but you have done nothing in this connection.

Still we are prepared to purchase the house on the above mentioned terms. But the sellers must agree and we are prepared to purchase. The purchase money cannot be given to anyone else; we shall directly deal with the sellers and pay them directly. So direct contact with the sellers is absolutely necessary.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
