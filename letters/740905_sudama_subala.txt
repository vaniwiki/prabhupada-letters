====== Sudama, Subala ======

My Dear Sudama and Subaladas

Goswamis:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated July 29, 30, August 6, 28 and 29th and telegram dated August 6, 1974 and have noted the contents. This restaurant program will not work. Do not attempt. You have to organize that new house. The restaurant is not at all advisable at the present moment. Restaurant is a very difficult thing.

Best idea is for Subala to go to Fiji and preach. That is the business of sannyasi, not opening restaurant. Restaurant is for grhastha. Preaching is first. Subala should go there and tactfully manage and get men from Australia. Mr. Punja has written that he is arranging the ticket and will give assistance. So do it nicely.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
