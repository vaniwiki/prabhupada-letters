My dear Suresh Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter from Guyana dated 16 July, 1972, duly forwarded to me at my London address. Thank you very much for the sentiments expressed therein. A disciple means one who is always following the orders of the spiritual master. So I instruct my disciples to refrain from four prohibitions, namely no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no illicit sex life, no taking of intoxication, including tea, coffee, cigarettes, etc., and no gambling. Besides that my students must chant sixteen rounds of japa-mala of Hare Krsna mantra daily. So if you are able to follow these principles without fail, then you are as good as my disciple. And after you have practiced these things for a few months' time, then we can see to your formal initiation. This chanting of sixteen rounds of japa-mala daily, chanting the full Hare Krsna mantra, Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, on each bead 108 times in each round, this process will very quickly purify your existence, and you will come to your rightful spiritual understanding in very short order. Since you have asked me, this is my advice to you. You and your family sit down and chant daily some japa and have some kirtana (or chanting Hare Krsna mantra in full %%__%% with kartas and mrdanga.) Besides that you may order our books from the Los Angeles world headquarters, 3764 Watseka Avenue, Los Angeles, 90034, California, %%__%% when you have got our books, then you may hold class all together daily at least one hour and read the Bhagavad-gita, Isopanisad, and other scriptures. You may address your inquiries about the literature in Los Angeles to Sriman Karandhara das Adhikari.

Regarding the visa problem for our devotees coming there, I shall very much appreciate if you can arrange something with the government so they shall have no problem remaining there for some time to do some tangible work in Guyana. I am returning myself to Los Angeles in a few days from London, so you may reply at the Los Angeles address as above.

Hoping this finds you and your family in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
