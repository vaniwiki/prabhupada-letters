====== Dhananjaya ======

Vrindaban

My dear Dhananjaya dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 9, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding the land purchase, these soil tests are unnecessary. All the land in that area needs fertilizers, that we know. Anyway, you can give up this. If there is doubt, then there is no need for purchasing this land.

I am glad to note that the Home Minister is looking into the visa problem for our men. The idea is that we are spending so much for constructing these projects but no local Indians are coming forward to join us. So who will manage these projects? We require the foreigners to manage. In Vrindaban we will keep at least 50 foreigners.

It is very good that the Governor Mr. Reddy has visited our temple. He should be invited for being the Chief Guest and Inaugurator of the new temple. I am writing to him in this regard separately. Krishna has sent both these Governors.

Regarding your inquiry about your position, that is a bona fide position to remain a servant of the servant of Krishna [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|(Cc. Madhya 13.80)]]. So for the time being you can help Tejiyas in Delhi collecting and preaching.

In the meantime please go and see the Manager of Punjab National Bank, Vrindaban with the enclosed two letters and take replies. I also want to know how many Fixed Deposit Receipts are in their custody. Give me all the numbers and amounts. They should keep the certificates but you should mail me the particulars.

It is good that your wife is there. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
