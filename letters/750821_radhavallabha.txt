My dear Radhavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 15, 1975 and also the copies of the Vyasa Puja book. It is done nicely, but why it is mentioned my 79th birthday. It is my 80th birthday. That is correct. You do not know this? One of the GBC articles says 79th birthday. Big GBC man, so many editors, and it is not detected? You are all mudhas, what can I do? Anyway it is better to remain a mudha before your spiritual master. Just like Caitanya Mahaprabhu, He said that My spiritual master saw Me as mudha.

Do not worry, in spite of war, Srimad-Bhagavatam will be distributed. We don't care for war. Our preaching business will go on. Your desire for the complete Srimad-Bhagavatam will be fulfilled. The Sixth Canto I have already completed and I shall begin the Seventh Canto within a fortnight. When I am relieved from the administration work, then it will be done.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
