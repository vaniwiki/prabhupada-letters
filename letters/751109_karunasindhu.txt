My dear Karuna Sindhu das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 24, 1975 and I have noted the contents. I am very glad to receive your letter. I can understand this cunning Purusottama das has taken advantage of your simplicity. So any one of my godbrothers cannot help me in this way of book writing because they are unfortunate in the matter of preaching work. They are simply trying to infiltrate our society to so something harmful by their attempt. So please do not have any correspondence with this Purusottama or any of my godbrothers, so-called. And do not do anything without consulting me. You can inform this instruction to everyone and send back to me the sheets of corrections sent to you by Purusottama.

I was very much anxious to know how Purusottama entered in our camp. Now the matter is clear. Be careful for further dealings with such men.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
