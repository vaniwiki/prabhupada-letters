====== Bhagavan ======

Paris

Dear Bhagavan dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 30/3/74 along with the French edition of Back to Godhead which is certainly a great pleasure for me. I can see by this publication and by your report that things are going on nicely in Europe. All your programs are approved by me; simply if you keep on with it, slowly but surely we will become very solidly situated there with many devotees and books and temples. Krsna simply wants to see our desire.

I will be glad to come to Paris on your invitation for the second week of May. I will also be able to visit Geneva, Sweden and Rome if you will arrange programs for me. As you know, I must return to India for the Janmastami celebration in August. So if I fly from India to Paris and arrive the second week of May, then I may stay no more than 4 or 5 days each in Paris, Geneva, Stockholm and Rome, and then go to Germany and stop at three or four centers there also. Then in late June I may go to Australia. Satsvarupa can write you further concerning the fixing up of visas, arrival dates etc.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
