====== Harikesa ======

Vrindaban

My dear Harikesa das:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter dated October 28, 1974 addressed to Brahmananda Swami and also the enclosed letter from Gurudasa. I have also received the report from Gopala Krishna, especially how nice is the prasadam program there. Thank you very much. You have improved the situation there so much. and I am very much obliged to you. I want that our Vrindaban temple to be the first class temple of India. Already people are saying that it surpasses all temples of the district in beauty, and I think it surpasses all temples in India. So now it must be managed very nicely. You have followed my instructions for making the kirtana program there the center, so I know that everything will go on nicely there.

Regarding Gurudasa, please inquire as to how much he has collected and send me the report. I want to know what he has collected and what was the expenditure. Encourage the U.K. devotees to stay in India because they do not have any visa problem.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
