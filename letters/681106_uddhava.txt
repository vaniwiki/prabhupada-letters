====== Uddhava ======

My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessing. I am in due receipt of your letter. I think you should consult your Godbrothers in this connection. So I have no objection if you decide to marry as a matter of necessity. Hope you are all well. Please convey my blessings to all boys & girls.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
