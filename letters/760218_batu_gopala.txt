My dear Batu Gopala das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 31, 1976.

I accept Sriman Dhananjaya Pandit das for brahman initiation. You may hold a fire sacrifice and he should listen to the Gayatri mantra in the right ear from the tape. He can be instructed that the duty of a brahman is to maintain cleanliness. Internal cleanliness is always chanting Hare Krishna and external cleanliness is bathing regularly. You yourself must set the example.

Regarding your question regarding your household situation, that is not the spiritual master's business.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
