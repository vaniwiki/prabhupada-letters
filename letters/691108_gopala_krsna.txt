====== Gopala Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank your very much for your letter of October 18, 1969, and yesterday I received your gift of one shawl. This shawl is very nice, and it will be used when I go to some meeting in my dress garments. Please send some me the new editions of the French __BTG.__ If you are able to print them nicely in outside press for a good price, then it is very good. But in any case this magazine should be published regularly. The addresses of the Paris devotees are as follows: Suridas Adhikari, 2 Place de la Chapelle, Paris, 18, France. Janardana's address is 6, rue Michelet, 94 Fontenay-Sous-Bois, France.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
