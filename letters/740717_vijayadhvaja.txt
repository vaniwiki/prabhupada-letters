====== Vijayadhvaja ======

<card class="letter">
Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Vijayadhvaja dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I may inform you that I am sending Subaladas Swami along with three other men Australia to assist you. So you should arrange for his ticket. I think you can have Mr. Punja arrange this ticket.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
