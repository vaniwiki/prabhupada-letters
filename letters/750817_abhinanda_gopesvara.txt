====== Abhinanda, Gopesvara ======

Hyderabad

My dear Abhinanda das and Gopesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 25, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your success of book distribution to the libraries has given me great pleasure. Gopala Krishna has discussed with me the problem of selling books imported under the present CCP. We are planning to import books for sale to libraries through an importer of books in Delhi. The arrangements will be finalized in about two weeks, and then we will be able to supply you with all the books you need for libraries.

This distribution of books to the libraries is very encouraging. Please expand this program all over India. In one library carrying my books, hundreds of people will be able to read.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
