====== Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejiyas,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letters of May 6 and May 7. You have requested 9 checks listed as follows:

Rs. 193/60---Munna---Sand\\
Rs. 2975/60---Munna---Sand\\
Rs. 895/00---Allahbux---Painting\\
Rs. 110/70---Munna---Labor\\
Rs. 8804/00---Allahbux---Labor\\
Rs. 25079/65---Yourselves---draft to Orissa Cement for hundi repayment\\
Rs. 3500/00---Rockwin India engineering for consultation\\
Rs. 384/83---Munna---Daily wages\\
Rs. 19858/70---Sri Girraj Cement Co.---white cement marble chips

The checks are duly enclosed. Please continue to keep accurate accounting and send me the ledger sheets periodically. This will enable me to keep up-to-date records. As for how checks will be handled when I am out of the country, I will arrange for this so do not worry.

Regarding moving our New Delhi center from its present location to a smaller place, I would advise you to first investigate the building which is now being rented by an old disciple of mine, who you have met, Acarya Prabhaker. He is located at C-121 Kirti Nagar in New Delhi. He is paying only Rs. 1200/ a month for this place. So go and see if it is suitable then we can investigate further. So my present plans are to leave for Europe from New Delhi. Therefore we will be able to personally discuss things in a couple of weeks.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
