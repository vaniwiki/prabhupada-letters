====== Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of 23 September, 1970, along with the note from your good wife, and have read them with attention. The sentiments which you have expressed are very much encouraging to me, that I have got such disciples as yourself who are more anxious to serve me than my own children. You are one of my oldest and best-qualified students, so now you may, along with the other men of GBC, take over from me management of ISKCON affairs and work combinedly to open as many centers as possible all over the world. If you simply carry out the instructions which I have given you Krsna will reward you with all success.

Caitanya Mahaprabhu has said that this chanting of the Hare Krsna Mantra will be heard in every nook and cranny of this globe. He is God, so there is no doubt about it. So if we are intelligent we will take advantage of this opportunity and get the credit. If we do not, someone else will.

So far your management of Southern USA centers as Zonal secretary, I have instructed Brahmananda Maharaja, Gargamuni Maharaja and Visnujana Maharaja to open one center in Coconut Grove, near Miami, Florida. Now you must open correspondence with them in this regard and encourage them.

Your plan to increase our propaganda activities in the colleges and high schools is very nice, and it is my desire that every American boy and girl will receive a Krsna Conscious education through our books. You have a very great responsibility to print and distribute these books. So far printing is concerned, if you are able to print books why not do it? I am prepared to give up dealing with Dai Nippon if ISKCON Press can print my books. What is being done with the manuscript of the unabridged __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__? It should be printed as soon as possible.

My European disciples have written that there are no books available in Europe. I want that each and every one of my centers should be fully stocked with all of my books, never mind if they can pay or not. The principle is that every center must pay for whatever books they order, but if for some financial difficulty a center is not able to pay for books still we should supply them whatever they need.

You will be pleased to know that I am resuming my translating work here in the peaceful surroundings of a Sita-Ram Temple in the suburbs of Bombay.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
