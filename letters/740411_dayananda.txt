Dear Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 29, 1974 and I have noted the contents.

It is extremely assuring to me to hear that Gurukula is doing nicely. The importance of the school in Dallas cannot be overestimated, both for our ISKCON movement, and for the outsiders as well, indeed it is important for the whole world. I was discussing this point in my lecture last night here in Bombay, that human life means __tapasya,__ and tapasya must begin with __brahmacaryena,__ life at Gurukula. The boy is supposed to lie down on the floor, collect alms for the spiritual master---not that they are trying very hard to make a comfortable material arrangement. But the result is that although in this age everyone is born a sudra, we are producing first class brahmanas who can actually do good for their fellow man.

I think also that you are the right man to be in charge of our school. It is especially nice to hear that the boys are becoming first class preachers; that is especially needed. Without preaching, our institution becomes all rubbish. So it is very good they are becoming good preachers. So along with Jagadisa you investigate the practical aspects of expanding by purchasing new buildings. Expand, develop and make it a unique institution.

As for Canakya sloka, I think the best thing is if I translate it myself and send it to you for printing, rather than wait for Pradyumna.

Please go on developing nicely. When I come to the U.S. next time I would like to go to Gurukula and stay there for some time.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
