====== Letter to: Citsukhananda ======

Los Angeles

My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 16, 1976.

I approve your plan to combine together with Kesava to lead a party of Spanish speaking devotees with nama-sankirtana to every town and village in Spain.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
