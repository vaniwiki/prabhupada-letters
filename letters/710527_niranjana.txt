My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 19th April, 1971 and have noted the contents. I have been so long in answering because just recently I went to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Sydney Australia also, and have just recently returned to Calcutta. Here we held one "Hare Krishna Festival" as we held in Bombay, and it was even more successful.

I am so glad to hear that you are doing so well in your German studies. If you become a German scholar, then I shall send you to Germany for preaching work.

So far as controlling "kam" or lust, best thing is don't eat any highly spiced food stuffs and always think of Krishna. Chant regularly and get yourself married as soon as possible, and live a peaceful householder's life in Krishna Consciousness.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
