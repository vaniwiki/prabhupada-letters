====== Aniruddha ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of February 11, 1969, and I was pleased to note the contents therein. I am glad that everyone at your temple is working hard and in full cooperation for keeping the temple nicely and spreading our movement as far as possible. This should be our motto. We have so many things to do for improving our Krishna Consciousness movement, and I am so glad to learn that there is a newspaper report wherein it is said that "Krishna Chants Startle London." Please send me at least one copy of the paper immediately. I want to read it. It sounds very much encouraging.

I have sent back the beads for Girish by separate mail, after duly chanting upon them. I am very glad to learn that he is completing daily his rounds at any cost. It is an example even for the elderly students. Please encourage this nice boy. He is given under your protection so take care of him very nicely. Just produce one nice Krishna Conscious youth. It will be a great service to Krishna and recognition of your nice service.

It is very nice that you are wishing to remain as a brahmacari. In London they are ideal householders. So actually it doesn't matter if one is householder of brahmacari. Sincerity of purpose is the only qualification for Krishna Consciousness. Sri Narottama das Thakura says that he hankers after the company of any person, never mind whether he is in the renounced order of life or in householder life, just as long as he is merged into the ocean of Krishna Consciousness. That is the one qualification.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
