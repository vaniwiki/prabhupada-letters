====== Bhavananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 6th, 1970, and noted the contents. I am very glad to note your feelings of dependence on the mercy of Krsna and Spiritual Master. Yes, that is the way of surpassing the influence of Maya. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gita that Maya is very strong, unsurmountable, but one who surrenders to Krsna---Maya does not touch him. So, all our books are as good as Krsna because we deal in the books about Krsna only. Therefore, taking shelter of these books means taking shelter of Krsna---there is no doubt about it and if you stick to this principle there will be no attack from Maya.

Please conduct the Sankirtana program regularly and that will give me great pleasure. Regarding our new Temple in Brooklyn, Krsna has given you very good chance to serve Him. From the very beginning I was insisting Brahmananda to have a nice place in New York. Now we have got it and Krsna is giving us all other opportunities. Please try to utilize all of these opportunities in His service.

It is very encouraging that you have got license from the Board of Education to continue our children's school. Kindly organize it nicely and it shall be a great achievement. We have to concentrate to give them some idea about God---that should be our first business. In art class they should be encouraged to draw pictures of Krsna, Kuruksetra, etc. There are so many subjects for drawing as it is stated in our book __Krsna.__ If they are trained, they will come out nice devotees. It will depend on the process of training. Regarding some misbehavior, that we have to check by training peacefully. Your attitude of tolerance and kindness is very nice, so train them in this way. It is Lord Caitanya's order that we have got to discharge welfare activities on behalf of Lord Caitanya.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls and children. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
