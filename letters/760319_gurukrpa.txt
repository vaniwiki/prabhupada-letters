====== Gurukrpa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gurukrpa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. The check for rs. 89,433.44, Check no. 6206 83679, of Bank of America, Bombay, is marked A/C Payee only. So how it can be deposited in my personal account? If necessary you must start an account at my bank, the Central Bank of India, 10, Camac Street, Calcutta-17, which is just near the temple. You can deposit the check in this account in your personal name, Gregory M. Gottfried, and give a __formal__ notice to the bank in writing that when the funds are realized (when the check is cleared), the entire amount should be transferred into my account number 831, in favor of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. This account is with the same branch of the Central Bank on Camac St. Thank you very much.

I hope that this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. If necessary this letter can be shown to Mr. Dutta, the Bank Manager.
