====== Karandhara ======

<card class="letter">
London

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. By now I think Syamasundara will have telephoned you with this information and instructions. First, regarding the business in London, it is best if you can finish it up yourself, remaining up to one week if necessary, then be prepared to go to India.

Regarding London affairs, whether George will stand as guarantor on the mortgage, or whether Syamasundara's presence required. If George is agreeable to be the guarantor, that is not a very big thing, only a small favor and he hasn't got to pay anything. We shall pay whatever money we have got and the rest monthly for so many years, the longest period we can get.

The situation in Bombay is that five lakhs rupees are required for executing the conveyance. This is being arranged through bank and Sumati Morarji. If this is done, then everything will be all right. But if they are not able to get the bank loan, you go there and make everything complete and the money will be supplied by Mr. Jayan. You can say it is a loan from a "friend." As soon as you get money from Jayan via Tamala Krishna and Bhavananda, then you all three sign jointly the letter of order and we will transfer the money from here. One thing is, the money should not be given directly to Nair. Rather you go with him to the tax officer and pay in his presence as witness, or the money should be paid in the registrar's office while registering the conveyance. This way or that way, but do not pay the money directly to Nair.

I want to sell those bonds, so what is the process? Have you got some broker? I shall require to know his name and address and other details. If you are remaining in London for a few days, we shall contact you further what is the next step.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
