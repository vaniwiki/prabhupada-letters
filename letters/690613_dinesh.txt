====== Dinesh ======

My dear Dinesh,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for sending me the broadcasting tape containing varieties of our Sankirtana Movement and it has come very, very nice. I have received one letter from Mukunda that you are already in negotiation with him for complete cooperation with the Beatles in future, and this is very nice program. Most probably I shall be going to London by the end of July, and from different sources I can understand that the Beatles are becoming interested in the Sankirtana Movement. In the meantime you may have received my letter to you dated June 10th in which I have asked you to explain some lines mentioned in the agreement between you and me. So I am expecting your reply, and upon receipt of it, I shall immediately send you the signed agreement as you have sent it to me.

Please offer my blessings to Krishna Devi and Visnuaratrik. I hope this will meet all of you in good health. Thanking you once more for the tape.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
