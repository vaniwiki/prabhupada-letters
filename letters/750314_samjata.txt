====== Letter to: Samjata ======

Melbourne

My dear Samjata,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated Feb. 3rd and Jan. 20th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank-you for the newspaper clipping. This proves that Krishna Consciousness is more attractive than material success.

Krishna has given you a nice responsibility there in Australia, so work nicely with the devotees there and remain always strong in Krishna Consciousness by following all of our rules and regulations very carefully and chant at least 16 good rounds daily.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
