====== Patita Uddharana ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Patita Uddharana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated Jan. 18th, and 27th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your column in the Gujarat Samachar is a great way to preach Krishna Consciousness to the Indians there in London. They will become very much familiar with our ideas and goals by reading it regularly. Please continue it nicely.

Regarding the other points mentioned in your letter, Hansadutta prabhu has said that he can take care of these matters. Actually, I have requested that these type of matters be brought before the GBC instead of me. I am trying very hard to find time to write my books, so I want to be relieved from so many questions. Please work co-operatively with Hansadutta and everything will be very successful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. You can allow the sacrifice in the Manor for Mrs. Mehta, but as with with the weddings, they must pay for the room. (Don't have it in the temple room.) She can bring her own brahmanas.
