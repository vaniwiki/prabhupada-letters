====== Kunja Behari ======

Ashland, Kentucky

Dear Kunja Behari das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated January 4th and have noted the contents. My instruction is that whatever food they serve, you should not eat meat, only bread, some butter, milk, vegetables and fruit if available. And always chant Hare Krishna. Then, it doesn't matter whether you are in heaven or hell. Yes, it will be a great service, even in prison, if you can preach there. You should inform the authorities for protection if other prisoners attack you. We have no business there except chanting Hare Krishna.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
