====== Letter to: Rayarama ======

My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Sept. 19, 1968, and thank you very much for it. Now, you have to print a large number of Back To Godhead every month. I think only in California area you shall be able to sell 3000 copies per month. Similarly, in other centers also you can sell a large number of Back To Godhead, since the Sankirtana party is moving and people are purchasing very gladly. So you can expect golden days very soon. And you must prepare yourself for this purpose.

Regarding your assistant: I must help you in this connection, and I think Subala will be one of your best assistants. He is struggling very hard alone in Santa Fe. If Brahmananda and yourself can arrange to send somebody to take charge of Santa Fe, he can immediately be called for your assistance. similarly, there is a new boy, Cintamani (Christopher Fynn) who is in Montreal temple. I think he can also be a great help to you. You can open correspondence with Hansadutta in this connection, and if you think that boy is suitable, he can also help you. Please continue to send our Back To Godhead to all persons, I have given you list---especially to Sumati Morarji at Bombay, because she is coming again to help our activities. You can send copies to Hawaii also to Gaurasundara to the following address: Gary McElroy; room 5066; Armed Services Y.M.C.A., 250 South Hotel Street; Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813.

Regarding my stationary: It is almost finished and you can arrange for printing next copies to your good choice. Govinda dasi doesn't like the setting of __camp__ and __date.__ But I am moving everywhere, practically I am not fixed up at any address, so you have to adjust as nicely as possible.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enclosure: 1 letter from Subala
