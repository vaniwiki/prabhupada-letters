====== Rupanuga ======

Deleplane, Virginia

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 31, 1976.

I have before me the Sankirtana Newsletter for January 12-18, so why are you standing third?

Regarding Philadelphia's move, yes, that is all right. And yes, we require many Ph.D.'s for our Bhaktivedanta Institute for Higher Study.

The program in Amherst is nice, continue it and develop it more and more.

As far as New York is concerned, that is nice. Let Madhudvisa be in charge.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
