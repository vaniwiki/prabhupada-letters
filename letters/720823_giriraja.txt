My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your long letter, and immediately I have sent one telegram as desired by you, reading as follows:

TAKE BANK MORTGAGE PAY OFF NAIR NARANARAYANA IMMEDIATELY RETURN TO USA MUST OBSERVE FAST JANMASTAMI TILL 12 AM

BHAKTIVEDANTA SWAMI\\
In the conveyance deed, there is a clause on page 7 that states that the purchaser shall not be required to pay either of the last two installments, namely E and D, aforesaid, until the suit filed against the vendor in the Bombay High-Court (suit #94 of 1968, Messrs. Chhaganlal and Co. vs Mrs. Candrabai A.B. Nair) is disposed of and the amount, if any, in the said suit is paid to the plaintiff. Therefore, out of 14 lakhs, we have paid 2 lakhs. The bank may pay further 8 lakhs, and 4 lakhs should be held up until the above-mentioned suit #94 of 1968 is disposed of. In this way arrangements should be made. Regarding construction material, I see that 64 lakhs will be spent for the whole construction, and you have to pay 5% on the amount to the architect. I think it will be a huge amount. In Delhi, one architect asked for 2%, but I thought that somebody may contribute his service for this great cause. If not, the charges may not go more that 2-2 1/2%. In this connection, you may consult Gurudasa. I think that 5% is too much. Anyway, you are on the spot, you can do the needful by consulting amongst yourselves. Formerly it was understood that Mr. Nair would not charge interest. Anyway, if you have to charge interest, better go to the bank. There is a proposal that somebody wants to donate seven acres of land at Ahmedabad, 17 miles from the town. This proposal was sent by Paramahamsa das Brahmacari, and I have already replied his letter. So if it is convenient, some of you can go see the land, and if it is favorable, we shall go and develop an asrama there. There was a reference in the letter of Mahamsa that the President Giri can open the foundation stone ceremony of our temple, as he is a friend of Mr. Somani. I have already replied his letter, and you can see it. If it is a fact, I have suggested that the ceremony can take place on Wednesday, September 20. That day is auspicious on account of the appearance of Vamanadeva and Srila Jiva Goswami. If it is a fact, then we can invite many responsible persons---the Prime Minister, Governors, many secretaries on that occasion. Then it will be possible to place our philosophy before a very respectable assembly and it will be easier to raise funds also. People have not yet understood our philosophy, how glorious it is, and how this Indian culture could be accepted throughout the whole world. The ritual foundation stone ceremony was already observed and you have the marble tablet. I think President Giri's name also will be included in that tablet and it will be set up on the corner foundation of the temple.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
