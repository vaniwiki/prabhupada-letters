====== Jayapataka ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 7, 1970.

I am glad to learn that Toronto center has got such good prospect for success. If we are simply a little sincere in the matter of spreading this movement, Lord Krishna has already guaranteed our success. It is good that there is a large population of young people in Toronto as it is the younger generation which is most appreciative of our Krsna Consciousness movement. So do your best to preach our philosophy to them that they can be inclined to join with us in spreading Lord Chaitanya’s Samkirtan.

I am also glad to learn that everything in Montreal is now running smoothly under the direction of Sripati, and similarly that Raktak is very capable to manage the new center in Toronto as you are now feeling uncertainty what to do now yourself. From your letter it appears that Toronto has more potential for Krsna Conscious engagements, so why not remain there and assist Raktak. Our main business is service. Management of the temple must be there, but being president is not our business. Our business is to preach Krsna Consciousness. So if your presence there is helpful you may remain for some time.

Now we want some men who understand all the purports of the Shastras so that they will be able to face any questionnaires put to them especially ………. This is a very important business, and I want all of my disciples to be thoroughly versed in this way. Our first business to every initiated devotee is to chant daily sixteen round of beads without fail, and to follow the regulative principles rigidly, and our literatures must be studied with great attention. We have presented the complete philosophy of Krsna Consciousness in our books Bhagavad Gita __as it is__, Srimad Bhagawatam, __Teachings of Lord__, __Chaitanya__, __Krsna__,__ __and others being printed, so the classes and personal study should be undertaken penetratingly. Please see that all the devotees are following these principles; this program is the essential basis of our spiritual advancement. If chanting and following of the regulation is done sincerely, without offense, all questions and doubtful points of philosophy will be cleared up by realization of Krsna from within the heart of the devotee.
