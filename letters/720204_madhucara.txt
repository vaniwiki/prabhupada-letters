<card class="letter">
My dear Madhucara,*

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1/25/72, and so far we have record, we have not received your letter of 1 1/2 months back containing $5 check; so you may cancel that check and issue another if you wish. As we are always moving about, it is not unusual for the mail to become diverted, sometimes for months.

I am very pleased that you have been appointed as President for Phoenix, Arizona, center. Now you are being forced by Krishna to advance in Krishna Consciousness, because you must set the perfect example for all others to follow and be always very responsible and sober. I think you will have no difficulty, as long as our routine work is attended to nicely and the highest standards are maintained. Routine work means rising early, cleansing, chanting minimum 16 rounds, having kirtana, reading scriptures, deity worship, like that. Simply always keep yourselves engaged in these matters of regular activity as sincerely as possible, and do not neglect them for a moment, then your all other activities will come out successful, and you can be very certain that very soon you will find yourselves situated on the highest platform of perfectional stage.

I am very much encouraged to hear from you that you are teaching KC in the schools. This is our best field for making demons into devotees, so if you give intelligent presentation of our Krishna philosophy in all the schools and colleges, there will be no end of devotees to push this movement on all over the world. Simply demonstrate chanting and dancing, and induce them to participate, then give them nice philosophy talk, with questions and answers, distribute prasadam profusely, ask them to buy our books and magazines and study them closely---that's all. Try for this program, and that will help me very much. Thank you, for helping me in this way.

I Hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
