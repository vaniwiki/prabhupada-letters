====== Letter to: Rupanuga ======

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th January, 1976.

Madhudvisa Swami has come here from Australia and as he is free I am sending him to New York. I have discussed with him how I want my rooms to be. As things have generally not been so well managed there I have asked him to be ad-hoc President of New York Temple until the coming GBC meeting.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
