Dear Ranchor,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 1st, 1974, and I have examined the contents.

It is all right if you live independently as a grhastha provided you follow the rules and regulations. Chant together husband and wife and speak the philosophy exactly right as it comes in disciplic succession. You must speak Krsna Consciousness knowledge with no interpretation of your own.

As for supporting your preaching financially, if you are a preacher you can take a donation from the audience. When I was in the U.S.A. I was taking collection and the people were paying. Don't demand but you can ask and there is no harm.

Yes, I did not approve of your starting you own magazine. You can write articles for Back to Godhead magazine. Why attempt separately?

The drawing of the proposed temple for Bhaktivedanta Manor which you have enclosed is very interesting and it is done on a grand scale. I am studying it and will consider its use. Thank you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
