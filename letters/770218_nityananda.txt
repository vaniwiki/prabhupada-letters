Dear Nityananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your telegram requesting initiations for devotees on the New Orleans farm. Upon your recommendation, I have accepted Laureen Cogan for first initiation and her spiritual name is Lohanga-dasi. I am also accepting for second initiation, Jagatkarta dasa and Kamarikanta dasi. Enclosed find one sanctified brahmin thread. Hold a fire yajna and get them properly initiated. There is a gayatri mantra enclosed. Have them hear also the tape recording of me speaking gayatri; that should be heard through the right ear. Give them further instructions in the brahminical standards and all of you follow and practise all the principles very strictly, then your success in spiritual life will be assured.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
