====== Letter to: Jagadisa ======

Toronto

My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I was very glad to receive your letter dated 31st January, 1971. As you have recommended, I have duly initiated the four new devotees and their names are as follows: John---Yugalakisora, Carol---Kritimati Devi Dasi, Suzanne---Sujan Devi Dasi and Marlene---Mayavati. I have replied their letters separately and they are sent along with their beads. You should receive them soon.

It is very encouraging that we are being so favorably presented everywhere by the media. Just today two editors of Indian newspapers have informed me of their intention to print special issues devoted to our Movement as well as give daily one article on our philosophy. The article from the Toronto newspaper was very good report and our Sriman Rasananda has presented the facts very well. Please give him my thanks for this appropriate presentation. He is a very good boy. All our students, boys and girls become first class good by this nice process.

Please keep me informed regularly how things are progressing with your center and your zone. I am always very glad to hear from you how you are doing in Krsna's service.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
