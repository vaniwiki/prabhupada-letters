====== Letter to: Sons and daughters ======

My dear Sons and daughters,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very nice letters and daksina of $650.00.

Upon the recommendation of Govardhan I am pleased to accept you as my disciples. You new names are:

James Ferris - Yamunatatacara das

Charles Wilkoit - Carurupa das

Tina Chojnacki - Taijasatmika dasi

Donald Chojnacki - Dosavarajita das

Lynne Davis - Daksayani dasi

Christine Stein - Krodhasamani dasi

Gregory Stein - Gopalbhatta dasa

Now you must all carefully follow these four regulative principles (1) No meat eating, (2) No illicit sex life, (3) No intoxication, (4) No gambling. Always be sure to chant minimum sixteen rounds daily. Study my books carefully, go for sankirtana and engage in Deity worship in the temple. You are all very sincere boys and girls and now I request you to make your life successful for going back to home, back to Godhead.

Hoping this meets you in good health

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
