Vrindaban

My dear Pranava das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 3, 1974 with enclosed eight forms by Registered Post. Before this I have written you one letter dated 8/10/74. Please refer to that. The land will be purchased as I have already instructed in the name of ISKCON Mayapur-Vrindaban Trust. The money Rs. 1 lakh has already been transferred to this bank account. As per my letter dated 8/10/74, when the conveyance deed is prepared, and when I approve it, then I shall advise the bank to pay the amount before the Registrar. That is the way of payment.

Regarding the registration fee, I have purchased the Bombay land paying half and half. This is the system. I cannot invest more than 1 lakh in this transaction, including everything. But, your estimate is for more than that. Somehow or other I have secured this Rs. 1 lakh. It is not possible to pay more than this amount.

Generally a sales agreement is made when the papers are examined and the title certificate is taken from a bona fide lawyer. Then the conveyance is prepared on stamp paper. Then it is registered. This is the procedure. So where is the sales agreement?

You have not mentioned anything whether Pravakar assisted in this connection. The money is already there. There is no question of money, but everything must be done according to regular procedures.

The eight papers sent by you are returned herewith duly signed in two places. Please do everything very carefully. All documents should be made in English. From Bombay on 7th instant the money is transferred to a/c ISKCON Mayapur-Vrindaban Trust No. 668.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
