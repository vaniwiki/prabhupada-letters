====== Visvambhara ======

My dear Visvambhara das,

Please accept my blessings. I wrote you one letter regarding the translation work of Nrsimhavallabha Goswami and sons. I have not received any reply from you although I am very much anxious to know the result.

In the meantime I have written one letter to the Punjab National Bank, the copy of which will speak for itself is sent herewith. Please induce them to open the branch as soon as possible. The money is ready for being deposited.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
