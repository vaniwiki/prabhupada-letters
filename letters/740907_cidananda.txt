My dear Cidananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your five letters. I am glad to know that you are in good health and practicing Krishna consciousness nicely. So far the question of marriage, this is generally not the concern of a sannyasi. Therefore I have asked the temple presidents to take care of this matter in a mature and responsible way. I therefore request you to approach the temple president there and the GBC and ask for their advise.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. If you can remain a Brahmacari that is the best way of life.
