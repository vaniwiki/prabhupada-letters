====== Jayatirtha ======

My dear Jayatirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil.

Yes, then we can purchase. Why should we remain in doubt about 7 Bury Place. The place is nice, but the building is not so nice (7 Bury Place that is). The building on Soho is nice, I've seen it. Your idea to in the future build a major temple is very good. Then we can either sell the building on Soho or we can keep it for a restaurant if it is profitable. We can make the whole building a restaurant or a hotel. The Indians would like a completely vegetarian hotel.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
