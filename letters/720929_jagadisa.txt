Toronto

My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter dated September 22, 1972, and I very much enjoyed that slide of seeing the new deities in Toronto temple. It appears that they are being very well cared for, that I have entrusted you for, thank you very much. As long as Radha and Krsna are pleased by your serving them, you will notice that everything will operate very smoothly in your activities and Krsna is giving you all facility as much as He is pleased.

I am especially interested in your college program for the students, because they are intelligent and inquisitive to understand the higher things of knowledge, so try to approach them nicely and lead them gradually into Krsna Consciousness or the topmost knowledge. I am surprised to hear that the universities are freely allowing us to reside on campus and propagate Krsna Consciousness, this is a very good sign. I am going in a few days to San Francisco to speak at the San Francisco State University there on the topic of "Krsna Consciousness: The Best Alternative Life Style, the Ideal Community, the New Social Order." The professors and students at the University intend to "examine particular new movements in depth. The basic issue underlying the study of these movements is whether they comprise the beginning of a trans-national world culture, and what long range social and political effects might result from them." So we shall reply in this manner and illustrate that the Krsna Consciousness movement is the best solution for solving all these problems and that it is the best trans-cosmic culture for making everyone happy.

On your recommendation I am glad to accept these three students as my initiated disciples. Their beads are being sent under separate post, duly chanted by me, and their letter is enclosed herewith. Now you may hold a fire __yajna__ and initiate them and give second initiation to Krpasindhu, Soulacarya, and Kaumadaki. Teach them to chant on the finger divisions and play for them the copy of the tape of me reciting Gayatri __mantra__ in the right ear.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
