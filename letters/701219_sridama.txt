My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 6th December, 1970 and I have noted the contents carefully.

Now you and your good wife Manmohini are in Miami after having left Providence and that is very nice. Miami is a very good place to establish a firm center and if you can organize this center nicely, it will be a great credit to you. Just continue with your sincere efforts and Krishna will give you all assistance.

Yes, when I return to U.S.A. I must go to Florida, and I'm anxious to see you also because I've not seen you in a long time. I always remember your valuable personal service given to me. So go on and Krishna will bless you. Stick to the regulative principles, chant Hare Krishna and be happy.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
