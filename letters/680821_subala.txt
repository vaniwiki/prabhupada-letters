<card class="letter">
My dear Subala,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1968. And I am very glad to know that you are pulling on. But one thing is that you must be self-independent, because for the time being, the students from other centers are sending you money and Krishna devi also has written me letter that she is sending through Dinesh a $100.00 a month. But how much you are spending and how much money you have received, please let me know. Because my next attempt will be to start a press. And I think in that press, your assistance will also be required. The press starting is very urgently needed, and in that case I shall be requiring at least $5000.00. So your center must independent, self-independent, I might ask the students to pay me something out of their income for my press starting. So I shall be glad to hear from you what is the position and how you shall be maintaining your center. The idea is that local devotees must manage the local temple. In case of emergency, the other temples may help, but that should not be continued, for all the time. I think you will understand me right.

Sacisuta also has written me that he was in Los Angeles, now he is in San Francisco, and he wants to go to Buffalo. I have asked him to go to Boston, because in Boston there is necessity of such person to help Satsvarupa.

What about your permission for chanting in the park? This process has become successful everywhere. So you must get the permission, some way or other so that there will be no difficulty for collecting the necessary expenses. If you can chant in the park and collect some contributions, and can sell our literature, that will be very good propaganda.

I think as soon as you become self-dependent, you should ask the boys who are sending you money not to send money to you, but to me, because I will be requiring for starting the press. I am glad to learn that you are also looking for some job, and if by Grace of Krishna, you get it, that will solve the whole problem. Hope this will meet you in good health, and awaiting your early reply.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
