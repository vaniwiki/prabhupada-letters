====== Himavati ======

Hamburg

My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from you recently how you are and I have been anxious to know that you are recovering well from your car accident injury.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of a package yesterday which contained one set of Deity clothes. I have immediately got them on my Deities and They are wearing them and looking so beautiful. You have made the colors and clothes so nicely. I am very much pleased.

You are lying for some time in the hospital bed and still you are not wasting a moment of your time. This attitude is very good. This is Krsna Consciousness---not to waste even a single moment without serving the Lord in some way or other. So you have made these very, very nice dresses for Krsna and Radharani although you are so much inconvenienced by your injury. I am very, very glad that you have got this feeling to not waste even a single moment in the service of the body and mind but to utilize very carefully every moment of life in the loving service of the Lord.

I beg to thank you once more for the beautiful clothes for Radha Krishna.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
