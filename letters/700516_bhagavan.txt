====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

Detroit

My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your contribution of $200, sent through Gargamuni. Thank you very much.

I hope everything is going well with you in Detroit Temple. Perhaps by now you have received my invitation to you to visit our L.A. Temple at your convenience.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Krsna Bhamani Dasi, and your son, Vaisnava das. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
