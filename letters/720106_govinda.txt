My dear Govinda dasi,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good husband Gaurasundara. How are your Tulasi plants in Hawaii? How are they feeling? I am always thinking of them and you. Please let me know how they are growing and how you are taking care of them. This time when I go to Hawaii I shall sit down in the forest of Tulasi plants and chant Hare Krishna.

I hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
