====== Kurusrestha ======

Denver

My dear Kurusrestha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 7, 1973 along with the wonderful photos of Denver Temple. Thank you very much. I am very pleased. Carry on as you are doing. When I return to the U.S. next summer I will certainly consider visiting there.

I hereby accept the devotees as you have recommended for initiation and their names are as follows:

Emil---Svavasa dasa

Mike---Vyapi dasa

Joe---Naikatma dasa

Wally---Naikarmakrt das

You may send their beads of Kirtanananda Maharaja for chanting upon.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
