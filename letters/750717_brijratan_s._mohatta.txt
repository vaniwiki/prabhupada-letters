My dear Brijratanji:

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find herewith a copy of our latest issue of Back to Godhead containing the selection from Srimad-Bhagavatam as you had kindly suggested. We are making it a regular feature each month.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
