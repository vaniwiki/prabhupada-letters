====== Gaurasundara ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much glad to receive your letter dated the 11th Oct., and it is good news that you have got a nice room for residential purpose. And you have got now good assistant, Mahapurusa, so combined together, try to establish a very nice center in Hawaii. You organize the center in such a way that we can in future open centers in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Fiji, Bangkok, Sydney, and New Zealand, and all neighboring Pacific islands. And Hawaii will be our center for spreading Krishna Consciousness in the Pacific.

I may be going to Vancouver or Montreal from here, for a day or two to take my immigration visa, and then I may go to Santa Fe, and from there, I am going to Los Angeles. Please send me at least one letter in a week, the report of your activities there, and I hope Krishna will help you in your nice endeavor.

Hoping you are well, I beg to remain,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
