Vrindaban

My dear Pranava Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram dated October 5, 1974 reading as follows: RECEIVED YOUR LETTER WORKING ACCORDINGLY LAND ALREADY ARRANGED GURUDASA LEFT FOR LONDON TRANSFER ONE LAKH CONSTRUCTION FUND\\
---PRANAVADAS

I have already asked Bombay to transfer one lakh of Rupees through the Bombay PNB to the PNB Vrindaban Branch account No. 668. So please go and enquire whether they have received the money.

Regarding Gurudasa going to London, it is surprising to me. Anyway I have sent Dhananjaya das Adhikari to act in place of Gurudasa. Please try and help him, both you and Saurabha. He is very nice, obedient boy. He will be very much helpful in Vrindaban, so please cooperate with him fully. He has already left for Vrindaban with my instructions and a letter to the bank.

Regarding the land, you say it will be settled up near about Rs. 90,000/-, so why are you asking for Rs. 1 lakh? But, I have not received any report of enquiry in the affairs of the land, whether Prabhakar Misra assisted you in this connection. Anyway the draft conveyance may be sent to me one copy immediately made by our lawyer. I think he is Mr. Maheswari you said.

So do everything very carefully. Our money is collected with great difficulty. I want that not a single farthing may be at stake. Anyway the money is already there. Simply let me know when and how the money is to be paid to the other party. The usual procedure is that a bank cashiers check may be paid at the time of registration by the government that the land is being transferred to us.

Please send me immediately the draft of conveyance deed made by the lawyer.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
