====== Letter to: Prabhanu ======

Port Louis, Mauritius

My dear Prabhanu,

Please accept my blessings. With reference to your letter to Harikesa Swami dated 15th inst., Sriman Srineketan das Brahmacari may take second initiation at the next Mayapur festival.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
