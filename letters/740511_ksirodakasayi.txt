====== Ksirodakasayi ======

London

Dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. Since the Mayapur and Vrindaban festivals in March I have been mostly staying here in our Hare Krishna Land. It is a large estate and requires much management. Today I was talking with Caitya Guru das Brahmacari who is the ground manager here and he suggested that your good self come here to take charge of general management here as the younger devotees are having so much difficulty. Actually the idea of a more mature Indian for management here is very suitable to me. The karmis who the boys deal with here are always cheating them, and only because I am here I catch so many things. As I am leaving on the 23rd May for a tour starting in Rome, I am fearful what will happen here in my absence? I take this suggestion of yourself as manager of Hare Krishna Land as a very sound idea. If you are agreeable to help by service in this way then come immediately to Bombay and help the situation. Giriraja das Brahmacari is the president here, Manasvi and Yasomatinandana and Caitya guru and the important managers, but they are all very young men with not much experience of the world. I understand you are now prepared to take on full time service of this nature, so I think this is the best place for you. I have invested about 20 lacs in this property and already the routine devotional service, deity worship and sankirtana is going on, but at present the police commissioner has denied us sanction to build our big temple according to our plans, and also the status quo is threatened as I do not think the boys can manage the buildings and land which we own here. Potentially things can be very wonderful here but it requires strong management which I think you can do. So consider my proposal seriously and I hope you will be able to come and lead management of Hare Krsna Land.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
