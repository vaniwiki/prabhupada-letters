====== Kadamba Kanana ======

San Francisco

My dear Kadamba Kanana Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 8.31.75. The mercy of the spiritual master is always there, but we have to take it. Just like the sun, it is there for everyone, but we at least have to stand in a receptive place to get the benefit. So I do not know what you have done, but now you remain strict in the regulative practices of devotional service and make progress.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
