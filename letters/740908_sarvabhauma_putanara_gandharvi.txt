====== Letter to: Sarvabhauma, Putanara, Gandharvi ======

Calcutta

My dear Sarvabhauma, Putanara, and Gandharvi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your three letters dated August 6th, and am very glad to receive them. I have noted the questions. Anyway I am expecting to arrive in Calcutta some time this month and at that time I will be glad to see you and answer all of your questions. In the meantime you may please consult with Gargamuni Swami, the in-charge of the Calcutta Temple. He will also be able to help you with your questions.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
