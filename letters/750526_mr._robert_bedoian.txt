My dear Mr. Bedoian,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 17, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for being attracted to this Hare Krishna movement and engaging yourself in chanting Hare Krishna. You are most fortunate to be giving up your sinful activities and chanting the name of Krishna. Please continue and go to visit our temples as much as you can. After you have followed our principles for a while under the instructions of one of our temple presidents, I shall, upon his recommendation, give you a spiritual name and initiate you into the chanting of Hare Krishna. For the time being, it is not necessary for you to have a deity of Krishna. That will come later. For now, just chant Hare Krishna and read my books, and try to follow our principles in association with devotees.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
