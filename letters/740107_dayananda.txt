====== Dayananda ======

Dear Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 30, 1974, and I have carefully examined the contents.

On your recommendation, I am glad to accept the following devotees as my disciples, and their spiritual names are as follows:

Geoffrey Simpson---Jyotir das

Shawn Kennedy---Stavya das

Kenneth Grenham---Kedaranatha

Nancy Grenham---Kama-nagari

You may send their beads to Kirtanananda Maharaja to be chanted on. Please impress upon these students that they must now chant at least 16 rounds daily without fail, and strictly observe the regulative principles. If they follow these things their spiritual advancement will be very swift. You may hold a fire yajna for the initiates.

I have accepted the devotees whose names you have sent me for second initiation, Aksobhya das, Jnanagamya das, Carucandra das, Rathangapani das, Krsna Kumari dasi and Bisa Laksi dasi. I am enclosing 4 sacred threads chanted on by me, and 6 copies of the gayatri mantra. Have them hear the mantra on the tape through their right ear, and instruct them carefully on Brahminical life.

I am always thinking of and appreciating the important work you are all doing there in our Krsna Conscious Gurukula. Please keep steadfast in the program as I have instructed. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
