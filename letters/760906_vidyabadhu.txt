====== Vidyabadhu ======

Los Angeles

My dear Vidyabadhu devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. You and your son should come immediately to Vrndavana and stay under the direction of Gurukula. You may engage as a teacher of young children and your son will be a student. You will be supported by a pension that your husband has now received from the US government.

There are three enemies. One of them is the mother with child who marries again. The child should be raised in Krsna consciousness movement where both of you will advance in developing love of God.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
