====== M. V. Sita Ramalai ======

Sri M.V. Sita Ramalai, Advocate\\

Rajahmundry 533103 East Godavari A.P.

My dear Sri M.V. Ramalal,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21-12-74 and have noted the contents. In regards to your question, we are accepting the Srimad-Bhagavatam as it is without interpretation and in that book in the 3rd chapter of the 1st canto all the incarnations of Godhead are listed. (at least the major ones are there). It is stated there that Lord Ramacandra advented and also disappeared many many 100's of thousands of years ago. This is all I can say on this matter. I cannot go beyond what the sastra says.

If you happen to go to Hyderabad sometime, you are welcome to visit our Radha-Krishna Temple there. The address is: Hare Krishna Land, Nampally Station Road, AP.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
