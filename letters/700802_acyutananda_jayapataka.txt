====== Letter to: Acyutananda, Jayapataka ======

Calcutta

My dear Acyutananda and Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram reading as follows:

"Krishnas provided six months free house nine rooms occupy August fourth"

I hope by the time this letter reaches you, you might have already occupied the house, so reply me this letter to London address 7 Bury Place, London, W.C.1. I am going there for a month to rest completely. So on receipt of your further reply that you have occupied the place I shall send you at least 10 brahmacaris immediately as you desired formerly.

I have not heard, however, from you anything about the Mayapur land---this is also essential.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
