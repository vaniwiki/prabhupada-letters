My Dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice letter from Gorakhpur dated October 31st, 1970. I have come back to Bombay and the letter was redirected from Amritsar.

I am so glad to note your realization about the Krishna Consciousness Movement. Actually it is unique and there is no comparison with it of any other Movement. It was Caitanya Mahaprabhu's prediction that by accepting this Movement, everywhere people will be very happy. Now it is in the hands of the American boys who are intelligent and resourceful. Therefore, this most beneficial Movement can be broadcast everywhere and everyone will be happy.

Sriman Ramananda Das Adhikary is also a great asset to our Movement and I am wiring to him one letter separately. Both of your combinedly do the needful. I have received letter from Jayapataka and he is also negotiating with the Hamilton House. If there is no important business in Calcutta, I have advised them to go to Gorakhpur to join you.

I have sent one telegram to Ramananda accepting his invitation for my going to Gorakhpur. Please keep me informed of the activities there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
