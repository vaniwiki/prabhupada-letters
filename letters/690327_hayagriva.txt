====== Hayagriva ======

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of March 21, 1969, and have noted the contents carefully. Yes, you can begin negotiations and as soon as I shall go there, we shall see and if possible we shall purchase the property.

Regarding my going to London: If you accompany me, that will be a very nice thing. I want your company always for editing my writings very nicely, but because you have to work for maintaining New Vrindaban, so let us see what Krishna desires in the future. If the press is started in Vrindaban then certainly I shall have to stay there the major part of the time, at least for the summer season. In the near future I shall have to stick to the press work and publication work.

Regarding the publication work, and editorial matters: I shall definitely settle it up as soon as I go to New York.

Hope you are feeling well, and I hope Syama dasi's health is improving by this time.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
