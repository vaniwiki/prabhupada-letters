====== Frederico Lourenco ======

Sintra, Portugal

Dear Frederico Lourenco:

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil with enclosed drawings, and I thank you very much. Regarding prasadam, Krishna does not accept any foodstuff offered by a person who is not a devotee. In the Bhagavad-gita it is stated: __patram puspam phalam toyam/yo me bhaktya prayacchati __[[books:bg:9:26|(Bg. 9.26)]]. So the importance is stressed on the bhakti, the devotion. Krishna does not accept anything unless one is a pure devotee of Krishna. How to become a pure devotee of Krishna, you have to chant Hare Krishna and follow the four regulative principles of no meat eating, intoxication, illicit sex, or gambling, and you have to follow a guru who is expert in the science of devotional service. If you are serious about understanding Krishna consciousness, you can live with us for some time in one of our centers with your father's permission and learn the science and do the needful.

Your drawing attempt is very nice. Thank you. Where did you get the om? Om is not required. Krishna is sufficient, but there is no harm.

You should read Bhagavad-gita As It Is carefully verse to verse and word to word, and you will be benefited, and if you have any difficulty to understand anything I shall be very glad to have your inquiry.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
