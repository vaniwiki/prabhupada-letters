====== Isana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Isana das,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife, Vibhavati. I am very much pleased to receive your daily reports, and you are one of the best students who follows the regulative principles rigidly for enhancing the devotional service. Rupa Goswami has recommended that for enhancing this spirit of devotional service one should be very enthusiastic, one should be patient, one should be firmly convinced, one should follow the regulative principles rigidly, one's occupation should be very honest and straightforward, and one should keep company with devotees. Anyone who follows these six principles of devotional life is sure to achieve success. Similarly there are six principles which we should avoid. They are as follows: eating or accumulating money more than necessary, wasting energy for material gain, talking unnecessarily, following the regulative principles fanatically without any sense, not following the regulative principles, and to become too much greedy and associate with persona non-grata. So as you are serious in the matter of advancement in Krishna Consciousness, you will remember the above instructions given by Rupa Goswami, and you will feel more and more secure in your endeavor. I am keeping your daily reports, and they shall be a good example for the other students.

I hope this will meet the both of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
