My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 23, 1974 with enclosed copy of BTG 67 and also your letter dated November 20, 1974 from New York. The BTG issue is very nice, and I am pleased with it.

Regarding the New York temple's books, they should be charged the regular temple price for all literature. When purchasing their house, if they require money, then the BBT will give.

It is understood from a telegram from Jayatirtha that Gurukrpa's Dollars 13,000.00 was not sent to India as you say but deposited in the Savings Account. So let it remain there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
