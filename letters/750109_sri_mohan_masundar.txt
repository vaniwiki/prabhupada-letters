Calcutta-47

My dear Sri Mohan Masundar,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 29-12-74 and have noted the contents. Regarding my assistance in the producing of your film, if you are producing it in India, it is impossible for me to assist you with manpower. I have no sufficient men in India to give you.

If you can join our asrama that will be very nice for you. But you have some business to take care of with your daughters, etc., so, finish up your business and then you will be free to join us anytime you like.

I will be returning to Calcutta in March.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
