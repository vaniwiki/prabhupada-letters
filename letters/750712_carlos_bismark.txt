====== Letter to: Carlos Bismark ======

My dear Carlos:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. It is very good to hear from you and that you are chanting and trying to follow my instructions, even though you are so far distant from any of our centers. This proves the potency of Lord Caitanya's mission. He predicted, "__prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama/ sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama.__ [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126] In every town and village My name will be heard."

Now through His grace this is coming to pass. So please continue to chant and also carefully follow the four regulative principles namely, no eating meat, fish, or eggs; no illicit sex; no gambling; and no intoxication.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
