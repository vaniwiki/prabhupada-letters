My dear Sriman Jose,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated November 1st, 1974 and I have noted the contents. I am very glad to see that you are seriously taking up this Krishna Consciousness Movement. I understand that you are distributing my books in Calcutta and I am very pleased by this activity. I also note that you are translating my books into Spanish and this of course will help our cause there in the Spanish speaking countries. So continue on with this service and Krishna will bless you.

Unfortunately the leaders do not take this Krishna Consciousness movement as being very important. They would rather see to the development of various types of sense gratification. They think that this is progress but actually we understand that this leads to degradation of human society. So Krishna Consciousness movement is means to solve the actual problems of the world, So therefore it should be taken up very seriously. You yourself should be purified by following the rules and regulations very strictly by chanting Hare Krishna and by co-operating with the temple authorities. In this way you can make your life perfect as well as everyone you meet.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
