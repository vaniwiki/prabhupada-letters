====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 1, 1968, along with enclosure of Acyutananda's letter. On the day of our departure I was expecting you in the airport, but I think as you are young man, you were tired on the last night, on the 30th April, on account of late arriving from the Long Island meeting, and you could not get up earlier from your bed. In that sense, I am more active than you because on that night also I got up from my bed at 4:00 a.m. instead of 2:00 a.m. as usually, and I worked on my usual duties. So you young men should not simply eulogize my hard working capacity, but I wish that you should also follow my example.

Now, it is understood that Acyutananda is on the safe side, and you might have noted that my friend Seth Dalmia has sanctioned for him 100 Rs. per month through the Dalmia trust. So I shall have less anxiety for him from now. Now, if he can open a center with cooperation of Hit Sharan, then we can send any number of Brahmacaris there. Later developments we shall have to wait. In the meantime, as I have already advised you, you please arrange to send 1000 Mahamantra records (by seaship) as free gifts for Indian friends and the documents may be sent to the following address: __Seth Jayadayal Dalmia; 4-Scindia House; New Delhi-1; India.__ This may be done immediately and the price $500.00 may be paid to Mr. Kallman in cash. Mr. Kallman formerly supplied us at 50c per piece which we meant for selling, but this time we are now distributing free. So he should have reduced less than 50c; if not, let him not charge more than 50c. Because this 1000 records we are taking from the old stock. When he manufactures the new stock we shall pay him as he desires.

I have already advised Acyutananda for purchasing your store goods. Now if you can send him a list of goods you require, and he may submit you a quotation from the Delhi market. I hope you have already sent Mr. Kallman's letter to San Francisco, and I am very much anxious to know the result of it. Also, I shall be glad to know the affairs in connection with MacMillan, and Dai Nippon. You will be pleased to know that yesterday we had a very nice meeting in the North Eastern University, and they presented copies of the enclosed letter for distributing. The copy is enclosed; please find.

Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
