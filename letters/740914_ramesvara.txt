====== Letter to: Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the August BBT report dated September 1, 1974. Thank you for sending it, it has given me much pleasure. I am now improving in my health and soon will be leaving Vrindaban for Mayapur. The new form for book distribution in South America is very encouraging. So print largely and distribute. Just as large temples there can distribute easily over 1,000 Isopanisads each day, then you will very easily distribute 100,000 copies per month, so do it.

I very much appreciate your report of Sarvabhauma prabhu who distributed 138 hardbound books simply because of hearing about my letter. That is very, very nice. They are all very nice, Krsna will bless them. This boy he immediately attempted and Krsna immediately responded. So this is the success of your book distribution. So if are books are distributed nationwide that is the success of our movement. I note that __Beyond Birth and Death__ is going to be reprinted. This book is selling very nicely. Everyone is anxious to know what is beyond birth and death. They believe only in ghosts, but they do not know that their is actually another position; tatra dehantara-praptir; you have to change your body for another.

So by Krsna's grace you are becoming a good manager. So stick to Krsna's service and He will give you more and more intelligence and more and more managing power. Krsna will be happy and you will also be happy.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
