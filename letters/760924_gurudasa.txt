====== Letter to: Gurudasa ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 1st inst. and have noted the contents. Harikesa has gone there to Poland to preach as you are doing, so take him with you. I have given him $1,000.00 for immediate expenditure and he has to return this as soon as possible. So he has gone yesterday morning, perhaps by this time he has reached. He likes to work jointly with Sucandra, but if Sucandra is not free then he may join with you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
