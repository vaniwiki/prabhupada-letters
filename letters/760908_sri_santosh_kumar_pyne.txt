My dear Santosh Babu,

Please accept my greetings. After a long time I have received a letter from you with mixed information. I am sorry to learn that one of your sons is in mental disorder, so do your best for treatment and depend on Krsna for the ultimate result. The chequered history of family life is the same for everyone. According to our philosophy we call it __samsara dava nada lida loka__ the blazing forest fire of material life. In the forest fire takes place without any human effort and it burns into ashes all the trees and animals without any relief. The relief comes from the cloud above the head.

Similarly the relief from this material world comes from above as we have got instructions in the Bhagavad-gita. So if you like you can retire from family life---you are old enough---and it may be possible for us to give you some shelter. I am in Vrndavana at present and shall remain here at least for one month. If you so desire you can come here and meet me. With my good wishes for all your family members,

I am yours sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
