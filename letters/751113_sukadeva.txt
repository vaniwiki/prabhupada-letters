====== Sukadeva ======

Honolulu

My dear Sukadeva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the booklet on the Kau Farm on the big island of Hawaii dated October 26, 1975. The thing is that to mortgage your present house is not at all good. There is a Bengali saying that one should not borrow money to purchase a gold earring. So I do not approve of this mortgaging transaction.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
