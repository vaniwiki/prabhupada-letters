====== Ananda ======

My dear Ananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated April 29, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. As you have suggested, I have sent one letter to Annapurna, in care of her father, and without writing my return address. As of yet I have not received her reply. I am very pleased to note that there are some nice boys and girls who are joining you at kirtana. Try to show them the importance of our movement, and the best way of doing this is by Sankirtana. Here in Columbus we had a very big meeting at the Ohio State University and more than one thousand students were chanting and dancing along with us. So there is very good potential for spreading our movement amongst the college students, and if we simply present them with the opportunity of chanting with us, and then we lecture on __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ then surely many intelligent people will become attracted. So Sankirtana Party in the streets and Sankirtana Party in school engagements should be our chief business. This will assure success in our propaganda activities.

Please convey my blessings to Mandali Bhadra and to his good wife, Vrndavanesvari, as well as to his nice little boy. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: Enclosed is a few nice poems by Srila Bhaktivinode Thakura which you may hand over to Mandali Bhadra for translation into German and to be submitted for publication in German Back To Godhead.
