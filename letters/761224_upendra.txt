====== Letter to: Upendra ======

Honolulu

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7 December, 1976.

If you want to stay with Satsvarupa, I have no objection, but what about your wife and children? They cannot travel. If without wife and children you can travel that will be alright.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
