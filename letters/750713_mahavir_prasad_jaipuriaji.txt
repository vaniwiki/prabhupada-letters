====== Letter to: Mahavir Prasad Jaipuriaji ======

New Delhi

My dear Mahavir Prasad Jaipuriaji:

Please accept my blessings. Last time we opened our Vrindaban temple under the leadership of the Governor of U.P. Dr. Channa Reddi. I expected your presence also. Perhaps you could not attend due to prior engagement.

So this Vrindaban temple is being visited by many devotees to the extent of 500-1000 per day, and we have got a very nice guest house. I request you to come there at your convenience and see how it is nicely done especially for the retired gentlemen, vanaprastha.

You are Jaipuria, so you can help me in completing such an institution in Jaipur also. Jaipur is visited by many Vaisnavas as a holy place of pilgrimage. Especially Gaudiya Vaisnavas go there to see the duplicate Vrindaban Deities such as Govindaji, Radha Damodaraji, etc. So I want to open a duplicate Krishna Balarama temple in Jaipur. I am sending separately copies of pictures of our Krishna Balarama temple in Vrindaban. Of course there is also Radha Krishna and Gaura Nitai. I wish that you have some land in Jaipur and to help us in constructing a duplicate temple like Vrindaban.

When I was a guest in your house I saw you a great devotee of the Lord, and I hope you will try to fulfill my request as abovementioned.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
