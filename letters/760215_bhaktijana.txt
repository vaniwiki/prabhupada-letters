My dear Bhaktijana das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 24, 1976.

Regarding preaching in Harlem and taking sannyasa order of life, you may speak to Madhudvisa Maharaja and work with him. He is senior man and sannyasa, so I will consider seriously his recommendation.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
