====== Bhumata ======

My dear Bhumata dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 2, 1973. I have examined the contents carefully and I think you are doing nice.

Because we are all individuals sometimes there is disagreement between devotees. When non-devotees quarrel they cannot stop and end up killing each other. But the devotees' disagreement does not last long because they patch it up for Krsna's sake, because they are all working for the same end---Krsna's service.

And devotees do not suffer from skin disease, black or white or brown or red or whatever. In the material world black and white are opposites, but spiritually black and white are varieties. That is the proper vision.

Now you can consult my Governing Body Commission for advice in your situation. I have no objection to your establishing a center there in Nashville, but these matters I am leaving up to my GBC. The GBC representative for your area is Rupanuga das Goswami who is presently here with me as my secretary for one month. He will be returning to the USA by the first week in April to New York City and I think you can leave a message for him there where he can reach you and he can see you personally in the matter. In the meantime you can make arrangements again with Atlanta for more literature making the proper arrangement for payment also.

I hope this meets you in good health and high spirits. Hare Krsna.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
