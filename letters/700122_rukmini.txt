====== Rukmini ======

Boston

My dear Rukmini,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14 January, 1970, and have noted the contents. I have also received your gift of two boxes of laddu expertly prepared by you.* They have so far lasted and I am enjoying some each day. They are first-class.

Regarding Srimurti Subhadra, the old Deity should not be repaired, but a new Deity should be carved and installed. The old Deity may be wrapped up in some cloth, tied up and weighted with stones, then put in the river. This is the procedure to be followed.

You may paint Garuda with the figure of half man/half bird. That will be nice.

I am happy to note that you are all trying to serve the Deities more and more nicely. Please go on in this attitude and such efforts in devotional service will become the greatest pleasure or Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*you can send me such laddus at least every fortnight a packet.\\
