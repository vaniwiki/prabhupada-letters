Dear Mr. Dharwarkar,

Please accept my greetings. Since I came to America I have not heard anything from you. Hope everything is well with you and your business. I shall be glad to hear from you about the progress of the sale of my books Srimad-Bhagavatam entrusted to you. I shall be glad to know if the sales proceeds have been deposited with my bank account as follows:

Savings Bank Account:

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

No. 4966 with Bank of Baroda Limited

Reclamation Branch Sachivalaya, Bombay-1

Due to my absence from India the printing works are suspended and now I wish to begin it again on hearing from you. The thing is that I am trying here to establish one Temple of Sri Sri Radha Krishna and one big industrialist of India has promised to pay for the cost. But there is difficulty of Indian exchange. So I am trying to get the exchange sanctioned through some friends in India and if I get the sanction then I shall remain here for many more days. So in my absence I wish that you may take charge of selling the books in India. Please let me know if there is any possibility of your taking such charge. So far my experience is concerned this publication can be introduced in all colleges and universities of India. If you have successfully worked out the business in your own Maharastra province as it is recommended by the Director of Education, then it will be possible for you also for other provinces. In Rajasthan and Delhi it is already recommended and similarly it could be recommended in all other provinces.

If you have not as yet deposited the sales proceeds kindly do it now immediately on receipt of this letter because I have to pay to the Press wala before beginning the 4th, 5th and the 6th parts at once. Also please let me know if you can take charge of the sale for whole of India. If you take up then I shall not negotiate with others because in my absence some body must take charge of the sale otherwise what shall I do simply by printing.

Kindly therefore treat this letter as urgent and reply it per return of post so that I can do the needful.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours truly,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta swami.
