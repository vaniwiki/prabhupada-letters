====== Letter to: Yamuna ======

My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very nice letter dated 8th May, 1970, and noted the contents with interest. Thank you for your determination. For the way in which I am trying to expand I require so many sincere assistants.

So the program which you have listed for the students and your daily schedule are very nice, and your schedule is fully approved. Just see that everything---Aratrik, Bhoga offering, etc. is done strictly on time. When every moment one is engaged it is called __avyarta kalatvam__ which means not to spoil even a single moment of life without Krsna Consciousness.

I am so glad to learn that you are regularly observing the listed holidays in our Caitanya almanac. The roaring kirtana, offering feast to the Deities with special preparations is our simple mode of celebration, and there is no special other program, this is standard, and that is our festival.

It is good news that Sriman Tirthapada has also engaged one carpenter to help rebuilding our London Temple house. As he is giving service, gradually he will come to Krsna Consciousness. His giving service is his qualification. As we accept valuable metal like gold from a filthy place, similarly we should allow any Karmi to work for Krsna.

Regarding Rathayatra, Jagannatha starts on the second day of the moon, and on the fifth day there is no meeting, but there is some controversy with Laksmi's servants and Jagannatha's servants---that is Herapancami. Jagannatha returns back on the tenth day of the moon.

Thank you very much for the silver for sweetmeat preparations and also the milk massala of ginger base; I have kept it for future use as you have suggested.

Yes the Brhat Saman is meant for the demigods---devotees are demigods---but people are not so advanced that they can sing Brhat Saman so nicely in this age, therefore Hare Krsna Mantra is recommended to be chanted without diversion. You have already mentioned __yajnanam Japaya jna'smi__ on the head of your letter, that the Hare Krsna Mantra is the best yajna sacrifice.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
