====== Yamuna ======

My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter of Oct. 21, 1968. I received your letter in Montreal but I have come here just day before yesterday. I am going to Hollywood from here and my return post address is given over leaf.

Regarding certificate you can add the following words within bracket after the word Acarya.

__Acarya (ordained Minister of Religion)__ you will be glad to know that I have been admitted in your country as permanent resident (Immigration Visa) under ordained Religious Minister and it is learnt that my initiated students may be saved from the military service. Please inform this matter to all others. I am herewith giving a note for Syamasundara and Malati which please show them. Offer my blessings to your husband, Mukunda, Janaki & all others.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
