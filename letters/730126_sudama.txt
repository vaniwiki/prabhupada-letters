My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letters dated January 9 and January 15, 1973, and I have noted the contents carefully.

Lord Caitanya is very pleased upon those who dedicate their lives for spreading Krsna consciousness. After all, He is the original promulgator of the Sankirtana Movement. So you may know it that in traveling and preaching about Krsna you are very much pleasing Him. This is the duty of a sannyasi, to travel amongst all of our centres for elevating the standard of devotional service. If by your presence in a centre the devotees become enlivened, that is the sign of successful preaching. It is not very difficult. Just read from my books and try and explain the meaning in your own words. It does not matter that you are not so expert at Sanskrit. You just try to realize the importance of Krsna consciousness and make your life cent per cent engaged in Krsna's service---that is perfection. I can understand from your letters that you are following Krsna's dictation and are trying very sincerely to help me in spreading this great movement of Krsna consciousness, and for this I shall always be grateful to you for dedicating everything to assist me.

You have my sanction to take with you Gaura Nitai deities. Carefully worship Them, attending to Them with regular aratis and bhoga offerings. Be very careful to maintain a strict standard of worship, and whenever you arrive at a temple you can place the Deity on the altar.

I have duly chanted the mantra for Brahmin initiation and sent the thread to Sriman Vaikhanas Das at St. Louis as you have recommended.

Hoping this meets you well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
