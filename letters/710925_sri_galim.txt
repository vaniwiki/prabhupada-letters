My dear Sri Galim,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. I can see that you are a very sincere servitor of Lord Krishna and that you have a sincere desire also for pushing on this Krishna Consciousness movement. Thank you very much. If you remain sincere and enthusiastic for spreading Caitanya Mahaprabhu's message then surely He will give you all facility to do so, you can be sure. And Krishna says in Bhagavad-gita that He will give you all intelligence in this connection. Everything will become revealed to you. Just like now we are commentating on the Western philosophers in the light of Krishna consciousness. I never studied different philosophy or science but Krishna has given me the intelligence how to defeat their nonsensical proposals. Soon these commentaries on the Western philosophies will be transcribed and published in a book entitled "Thus They Talked."

So Krishna will give you all intelligence how to push on this movement. Already you have a program for preaching at the university and you should continue this program more and more. The universities are always good field for preaching and distributing our literatures also. So work very hard and just depend on Krishna and surely you will be successful.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
