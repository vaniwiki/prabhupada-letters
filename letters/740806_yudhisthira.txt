New Vrindaban

My dear Yudhisthira das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 24, 1974 and have noted the contents. I thank you very much for your sentiments, and I was pleased to visit your house. I liked New Vrindaban very much how everything is going on. Now just develop it to bigger scale. Help Kirtanananda Maharaja to do this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
