====== Ādi-kesava ======

New York

My dear Ādi Kesava,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 3/8/76 which has just now reached me.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept the boy you have recommended for initiation. His new name is Giridhari dasa. Please make sure he knows to strictly follow the four regulative principles and chant a minimum of sixteen rounds daily avoiding the ten offenses. Hold a fire sacrifice. Tamala Krsna may chant on his beads.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
