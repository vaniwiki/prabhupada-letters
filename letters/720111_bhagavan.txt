====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

My dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 31, 1971, and I am very much pleased to hear from you all the good news. Yes, I am especially in cheerful mood to hear that our books and literatures are being now widely increased, but I don't think you will be able to approach near to the large amount of books being distributed by our California centers, especially in San Francisco. But if you can, then I shall certainly come there in Detroit and live there and translate there. I want to go and stay wherever they are selling the most books! But I do not think that anyone will become better than San Francisco.

If you like, you may now order from our devotees stationed in Jaipur one pair of gorgeous Radha-Krishna deities for Detroit center. They are settled in Jaipur now especially for this purpose of sending very best murtis to all our ISKCON temples who request them, including dresses, ornaments, jewels, etc. So I think such nice deities can be ordered by you, and you can give them very first-class home and give them all comforts and luxuries, either in that place or if you get a better place. Already they have sent very excellent black Krishna to Nairobi and New York of 48" height.

I am especially pleased by your proposal of producing many small leaflets and pamphlets to distribute widely to the public. Karandhara has initiated this program, and his small pamphlets are very very nice and to the standard, so you may also do like that.

I was just writing to our European centers that for so many years they have been there and nothing has been printed in European languages. This is not a very good sign. How can there be preaching without books? So I am glad that you are taking steps to organize printing of our foreign books. Please take this matter very seriously and print such books immediately.

I can appreciate very much that you are a sincere and intelligent boy, so I am certain that you are having no difficulty in managing nicely Krishna's affairs and making advancement yourself in Krishna Consciousness. Now I am trusting you all elderly leaders to do everything very responsibly and to the standards we have set, so that I may very soon begin translating fulltime. Thank you very much.

I hope this will meet you and all of the nice boys and girls at Detroit center in good health and lively spirits.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
