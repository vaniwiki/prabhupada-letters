My dear Radhavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram dated September 26, 1974 and have noted the contents. Your telegram reads as follows:

"FOR JADURANI'S NO. 23 PAINTING WHAT SHOULD LAKSMI HOLD IN HER FOUR HANDS PLEASE REPLY BY CABLE---RADHABALLAVA"

Laksmi holds in her two hands lotus flower and offers blessings with the other hand like you see with the murtis of Radha Krsna with palm open and facing forward. I have never seen Laksmi with four hands, so I do not know what she is holding.

I do not think it necessary to reply this matter by cable.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
