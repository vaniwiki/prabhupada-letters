Sri Pramatha Natha Roy\\

Handed over the manuscript of Shi Caitanya Mahaprabhu for printing in a three forms book on the occasion of Sri Srimat Sakhi Charan Das Babaji Maharaja's first disappearance ceremony.

If not printed the same is to be sent back to Delhi per registered post.

If printed he will send me at least 100 copies for distribution here.
