Dear Ram Prashad,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 10, 1973, and I have noted the contents.

I am sorry to note that you have not yet received your life membership cards or receipt as yet. I have sent your letter to Bombay and directed the President, Sriman Tulasi dasa, to immediately send you the same.

Our Bombay Hare Krsna Festival has been a grand success. More than 15,000 people attended each night and joined in the kirtana and arati, and listened very attentively to my discourses. At the end of the last day seven young men, two from Europe and 5 from India, shaved their heads as brahmacaris and have joined us full time. People are eager for Krsna consciousness, when it is given in its pure form.

I am leaving for Australia by 2nd February to visit our ISKCON center there and I shall be returning in March to officially open the first residential block of our World Headquarters at Sridhama Mayapur, District Nadia, West Bengal.

Hoping this meets you well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
