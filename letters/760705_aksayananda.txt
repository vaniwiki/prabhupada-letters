My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 20, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

If you organize you will get so many nice guests and they will contribute. Everything must be neat and clean and silent, then people will come. Safety at Taparia house is that it should not be left vacant at any time. Somebody, at least 4-5 men should be there to remain. Then the thieves will stay away. Everything must be kept under lock and key. You see what is necessary. Previously it was proposed to have a barbed wire fence. I do not know if that is necessary, but if a fence is needed then a high brick wall is better than barbed wire.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
