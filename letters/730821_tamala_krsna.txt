====== Tamala Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
Bombay

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Please immediately send me the names and addresses of all the foreign devotees in India. Please also their passport numbers and nationality.

I am just now speaking with His Excellency The High Commissioner Rasgotra Maharaja Krishin and he has promised to help us with the devotees who are being harassed by the Indian authorities.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
