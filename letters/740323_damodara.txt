====== Letter to: Damodara ======

Dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted the devotee recommended by you for first initiation and his spiritual name is as follows:

Douglas Duty,...Dandi dasa

His beads may be chanted on by Rupanuga Maharaja. Please hold a fire yajna and speak to him on the ten offenses against chanting. Personally see that he is chanting at least 16 rounds daily, without fail. By your own example you have to keep all the devotees enthusiastic and that is done by strict adherence to the regulative principles. Hope this finds you in good health, and I will be glad to hear of your progress in political sankirtana. Your political sankirtana Godbrothers, Balavanta and Amarendra are here in Bombay helping us for some time, but I have informed them that their real work is in the USA. So you are in the nation's capital and if you can get support it will be grand preaching for our movement. Anyway, we are simply presenting the truth, which is that outside of Krsna Consciousness there is no hope for betterment of the troubled conditions of modern affairs, rather they are going to hell without check.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
