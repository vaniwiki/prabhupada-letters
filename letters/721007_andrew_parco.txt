My dear Andrew Parco

I beg to thank you for your letter dated Oct. 4. 1972. If you are actually very much eager to search out God, you should know that logic and argument cannot help you because the opposing elements may be better logicians and may convert your decision by better logical arguments. So far books are concerned, they are differently described for different types of men and a philosopher. So we cannot decide either from the books or by philosophical speculation or by argument and logic. So the best thing is that you find out yourself who you think is the right person in the matter of science of God.

So far we are concerned we are following the __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ and we see the knowledge given in the __Bhagavad-gita__ is quite perfect in the matter of understanding God. If we compare the truth mentioned in the __Bhagavad-gita__ with other books, sometimes there may not be equal standard of understanding. So it is better to accept some recognized authority and follow his footsteps, and that is the best way for understanding God. we simply want that people should understand God, and love him also, because human life is meant for this purpose. So if a man loves God more than anything else, he is the perfect man.

I wish that you may follow this principle and be happy.

Yours Sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
