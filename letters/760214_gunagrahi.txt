My dear Gunagrahi das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 5, 1976.

Regarding your question about the brahmacaris, you may consult the GBC regarding this matter. Tamala Krishna Maharaja especially is qualified to give you good answer.

Thank you for the picture of Radha-Giriraja: it is very nice. I am having it framed for hanging in my room here in Mayapur.

The boys you have recommended may be initiated. Hold a fire sacrifice and they may vow before the deity, the spiritual master and the fire that they will chant 16 rounds minimum and obey the four regulative principles. Their names are as follows:

Dan Cooper---Dhiman Dasa

Mary Sandoval---Mahodari dasi\\
The six devotees you have recommended for second initiation may also receive the gayatri mantra in the right ear and you may instruct them to be clean inside by always chanting Hare Krishna and clean externally by bathing regularly. You yourself should set the example for them all.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
