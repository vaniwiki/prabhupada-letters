My dear Mahananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 20th April, 1970, along with a check contribution for my book fund of $150, and thank you very much for this. I have also received the picture of an "Angel" printed in the detroit newspaper, and it is a great credit how our men are appreciated by the people.

Your appreciation of our Krishna Consciousness Movement is very nice, and if you will carry this practical philosophy to the people of your great nation you will know the result for sure that this movement is the solution to all the problems of life. So I am glad that you are now going to our Washington center with your good wife. Please work there combinedly with great enthusiasm in advancing in Krishna Consciousness. I am very glad also that you and Hladini Dasi are now married in tilak by Sriman Bhagavan das. Please take my blessings for your spiritual marriage, and be happy in Krishna Conscious life.

Regarding your questions are the Spiritual Master and the Grand Spiritual Master consciously aware of the prayers of a sincere devotee who prays in love to Them?---the answer is that no conscious prayers go in vain. They are transmitted positively. But one thing you must know that any prayer you offer to your Spiritual Master and Superior Spiritual Master, all of them are conveyed to Krishna, so no sincere prayers go in vain. We shall always offer such prayers to Spiritual Master, Superior Spiritual Master, Vaisnava Acaryas, Lord Caitanya, and at the end Radha Krishna, that is the system.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
