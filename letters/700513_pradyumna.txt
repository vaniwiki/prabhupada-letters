====== Pradyumna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8th May, 1970, and I have seen the synonyms of Brahma Samhita verses. It appears that it is nicely done, but if I have to see it scrutinizingly, it will take some time.

In the last portion of your letter you write to say, "I need to have this back immediately for publication in the upcoming issue of BTG." So I can advise you that you can publish it as it is, and if there is any discrepancy we will rectify it in future. The policy of the BTG should be always writing articles which can be understood by people in general. Vedic literatures like Brahma Samhita may be published in separate books, but assimilated ideas may be published in BTG.

I am sending herewith back the notes on tape #14 Krsna.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
