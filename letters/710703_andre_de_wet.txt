====== Letter to: Andre de Wet ======

My dear Andre de Wet,

Please accept my greetings. I am due receipt of your very kind letter dated 12th June, 1971 and have noted the contents.

I am so glad to hear that you would like if we could open one branch of our International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) there in Cape Town, South Africa. That would be very nice. So if you can arrange for our reception, we may go there immediately, and even I may go on my way back from India, and we can establish one center. Undoubtedly this movement is very sublime and anyone who takes to it becomes happy.

There are so many spiritual groups; that is all right. But actually their method cannot help us to make real spiritual progress. This Krishna Consciousness movement is completely different and completely sublime at the same time, and very easy to take to also. Anyone who takes to it seriously, their life will become perfect.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
