Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Sarvamangala devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. I thank you very much for your sentiments, and I know that you are all working hard to make Bhaktivedanta Manor a very nice place. You should know it that our temples they are not in this material world. The temple is Vaikuntha, where Krishna and remembered and served 24 hours daily without stopping. So we already are in Vaikuntha by participating in the temple activities. So it must be done very nicely.

You have mentioned controlling lust, and this is very important. In Bhagavad-gita Krishna says: __tasmat tvam indriyany adau__ "In the very beginning you must curb lust by regulating the senses." Therefore we have the four regulated principles at the very beginning of practicing devotional life. In this way we turn the lust into love. This is our material life. Lust is there in everyone, because everyone is actually a lover of Krishna. It just has to be purified by proper training.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
