Dear Mr. Exley,

I beg to thank you for your letter dated July 15, 1968, and I shall be very obliged if you kindly let me know whether we can talk about __Bhagavad-gita as it is,__ in the church attached to the United Nations. Such meeting and discussions would be of great interest to many persons, and would be extremely beneficial to everyone involved. Please let me know if we can arrange some lecture engagement, at the church above-mentioned, at the earliest convenience.

I thank you once more for your kind letter, and for your interest shown in our movement, and I shall be awaiting your reply at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami,

Acarya International Society for Krishna Consciousness
