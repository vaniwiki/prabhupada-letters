====== Giriraja ======

Bombay

My dear Giriraja das,

Please accept my blessings. The other day you came here but I could not talk to you. All of a sudden you left.

For the time being I understand there is a need of an experienced devotee here. Tejiyas is sick and is going to Vrndavana. I think that Jagat Purusa is a suitable man to come here for at least one month and you can arrange to do this immediately.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
