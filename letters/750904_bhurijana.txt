My dear Bhurijana das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 11, 1975 with enclosed currency note of $50. I thank you very much. Please keep me informed regarding your Hong Kong visa.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
