====== Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 14, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. In my previous letter to you I inquired about the invoice sent by United Shipping Corp., but I have received no information about this from you. Please inform me in this connection in your next letter. I want to know whether the %%________%% from them $250.00?

Regarding Nara Narayana, I never advised him to organize a Sankirtana Party in New York. From the very beginning he was entrusted to cast Radha-Krishna murtis in brass. He tried it in so many ways but it was not practical. So at the present moment he is engaged there in preparing a dias and decorations for the temple. That should be his business. Next, if it is possible, let him cast some plaster of Paris Radha-Krishna murtis of the size you have got in the New York temple. If not, he may go for a few days to New Vrindaban and make schemes and plans for residential quarters and press accommodations, etc. If possible, Advaita may also go with him for a few days. In this connection correspondence may be opened with Hayagriva and Kirtanananda.

Regarding the press, as Advaita wants a little more time, so we should wait still for a few months more until he is confident to take the responsibility. Regarding the place for situating the press, in my opinion New Vrindaban is the best place. But I have no objection if it is started in any other place. But all circumstances and conditions must be taken into consideration before a final decision is made where to start the press. In New Vrindaban it is simply a question of providing a suitable place. I think that if we spend $1,000.00 for this purpose a very nice accommodation can be constructed there for locating our press. Whereas if we start in some city like New York or Los Angeles, for such accommodation we have to pay not less than $500 rent per month. So by spending two months rent we can have our own place with facility for further expansion. So these things have to be considered. There is now ample time, at least four months, so we should carefully think over these things.

I have seen the lotus sign with the word Iskcon on it, and I think that it is not acceptable. This is because one does not know where to start reading the letters. If you like to make a lotus flower for this, I have enclosed one picture which I have drawn and which you may consider. But Radha-Krishna must also appear on this letterhead.

Regarding the house in North Carolina, if Patita Uddharana's mother gives us permission to stay in this house for three months without any rent, then we can make an experiment. If this experiment is successful we can continue, otherwise we shall vacate the house. But also we must find a suitable person to go there. If she agrees, we can begin to make arrangements.

Our publication project is to finish __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ If we publish one volume for one canto, still it will not be less than 12 volumes. Besides this we have __Nectar of Devotion__ and two or three more books. This means all together another fourteen of fifteen volumes at utmost. Of course this will take time, but it is our ambition. If the MacMillan Company is interested, they can immediately publish at least one volume of __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ to make an experiment. They can either print the second canto in one volume, or the first canto may be edited by Hayagriva into one volume. So if they like, we can immediately hand over to them these manuscripts.

You are correct in your estimation that Dai Nippon is not to be blamed. It is our blame. In future we shall be careful and take into writing how much time they will take for each volume. When you print from Dai Nippon, the size of the books will be the same as __Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ but the pages will be from 350 to 400 pages. So you can try to fix up the time. Formerly they agreed to fix up their price at $5000. So immediately you make an understanding with them that just after receipt of __Teachings of Lord Caitanya__ we will submit a manuscript of some other book. So both MacMillan and Dai Nippon should be utilized in this way, and as soon as we have our own press we shall divert our activities in this direction. I think this arrangement will be nice.

I have seen your circular about the mailing list and it is very nice. I have already asked Tamala Krishna to take the addresses of persons who are purchasing our __Back To Godhead__ magazine. This idea is very nice.

Regarding Gargamuni's touring trip, he can take whomever he likes. If he finds somebody disturbing, this person need not be taken. But Gargamuni should not go alone---somebody must accompany him.

Bali Mardan has written to me to suggest that he begin working immediately to raise money for the book fund, but I think that first he may finish his schooling and then immediately begin working to raise money for our books.

Please keep me informed on the above points. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
