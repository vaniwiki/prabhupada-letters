Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 26, 1973 and have noted the contents. Your description of Sridhara Maharaja's birthday celebration is nice, and I thank you for presenting on my behalf a copy of Caitanya Caritamrta.

Regarding the Government's plans to construct a three crore tourist lodge, why not give the money to us, and we can construct? If this money is used for four such buildings as we have got plus a temple, this will satisfy the Government as well as our needs. You should try to get them to invest in our residence building construction. Tourists will come due to our canvassing. The Government can construct, and we can manage.

I am glad to hear that the doll making is improving, so please continue it.

All blessings of Krsna are unto you. You are such a sincere devotee of Krsna, that He must be pleased upon you.

I hope this finds you in best of health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Regarding land purchase give me your scheme and I shall consult Bali Mardan and Karandhara, or we can consider when they come to Mayapur next. ACBS
