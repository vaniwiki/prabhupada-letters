====== Syamasundara ======

London

My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings.

Regarding George's money: Brahmananda talked with Gargamuni and informed him that one week ago the secretary of Mr. Klein's APTKO (?) record company called our temple and said that the check is ready for you, please come and pick it up. In response to this, Rsi Kumar went to that APTKO Co. and they wanted to give him a check for $1,900. (19 hundred). Rsi Kumar said that we were expecting a check for $19,000 (19 thousand). So the check was mistaken and he did not receive the check.

Then it is learned that two days ago the secretary of Mr. Klein phoned Brahmananda and submitted his regrets that the check was drawn wrongly as $1,900, and he would call him again for delivering the right check. But up to now there is no news from them.

I do not know what is happening, but you may keep George informed about this fact, and if possible reply this letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
