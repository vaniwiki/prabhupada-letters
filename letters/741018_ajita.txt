My dear Ajita das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 2, 1974 and have noted the contents with pleasure. I am glad to learn that you are expanding all your activities, and I very much appreciate your efforts in this connection. Lord Caitanya will bless you.

I am pleased to accept the following as my initiated disciples and their names are as follows: \\
Per Jaderstrand---Prapujaka dasa, and Margaretta Jaderstrand---Mahamedha devi dasi. Upon your recommendation I accept for second initiation Aristahe das Brahmacari, and enclosed is his sanctified brahminical thread and the mantra sheet. When you hold the fire sacrifice, impress upon the devotees that they are taking vows before Radha and Krishna, the spiritual master, and the Vaisnavas, so it is a serious thing. The gayatri mantra should be heard from my tape recording through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
