====== Pusta Krsna ======

West Germany

My dear Pusta Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 15th January, 1976.

I am very glad to know that you have already purchased the Mercedes. For such a long time this car has been required and now you are fulfilling that desire. Thank you. But you must pay your entire debt to the Book Fund in the future, otherwise you will become that disciple who spends the money of his Spiritual Master.

Since you are paying, there is no need for Radha Damodara Party to pay. Their money is already being utilized for construction in Mayapur.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
