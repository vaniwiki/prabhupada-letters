====== Radha Madhava Sharan ======

Sri Radha Madhava Sharan\\
Vrndavana

Dear Sri Sharanji,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to thank you for your kind letter dated 28th May, 1970. I am so glad to receive a letter from a 70 years old young man. Sometimes they say about me "74 years young holy man", and sometimes they say "jet-age parivrajakacarya." They also very kindly have written that I have done magic to the foreigners. So I thank you all for your good wishes, although I am not elegible for these honors. Whatever is being done, it is Lord Krishna's mercy. He is unlimited and His mercy is also unlimited, so by His mercy even a crow can dance like a peacock.

Things are going here nice. The younger generation is taking very serious interest, and whatever advancement is made it is due to their cooperation. They are taking seriously to the sadacarya process---good behavior. The thing is that this country is not poverty stricken. So after material opulence the natural tendency is for something which is better. That better is spiritual enlightenment.

The leaders of these countries could not deliver that better thing to the hankering souls, and as such some of them have become frustrated and confused. Now, having received this transcendental message of Bhagavad-gita __As It Is,__ they are feeling relieved. So there is very good possibility of advancing this movement, and I am so glad that you are ready to offer your cooperation in this connection.

I have advised my secretary to send you immediately a copy of "Back to Godhead," and I am getting also many demands for the KRSNA book. I think in future you will be able to get this book from Atma Ram & Sons, P.O. Box 1429, Kashmere Gate, Delhi-6.

Regarding your cooperation, I have got many things to ask from you, but because you are a 70 year retired man I do not wish to overburden you. For the time being if you kindly help us by sending some goods from Vrndavana just like some chanting beads, some brass murtis, gopi-candana tilaka and similar other things. I understand that you have got business in Allahabad, so if your sons and grandsons there can supply us Banarasi dhoti and saris from Benares as well as some brass utensils from there, this is one thing.

Besides that, next year I am contemplating to send a World Sankirtana Party, therefore I wish to have a nice place in India either in Vrndavana or at Prayag Sangam. So I shall be glad to know if you can help us in this connection.

Thanking you once more for your kindly letter.

Yours very sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
