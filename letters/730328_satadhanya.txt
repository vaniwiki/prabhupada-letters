====== Letter to: Satadhanya ======

My dear Satadhanya:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 13rd March.

I am very much glad to hear that you have decided to return to Japan and help Trivikrama Maharaja. By now you should have the full fare and be getting ready to go there. I have heard from Trivikrama that they are distributing large amounts of BTGs therein Tokyo, 500 to 1000 per day. So you have had some considerable experience in Japan, and I am requesting that you return as soon as possible and help increase our activities there. I think Tokyo is unlimited, and soon we will have our own place registered there.

You are studying Sanskrit, that is very nice. If you can to learn to vibrate some important Sanskrit verses then you will be listened to wherever you go. On my return trip to India next time I expect to land in Tokyo so I can see you at that time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
