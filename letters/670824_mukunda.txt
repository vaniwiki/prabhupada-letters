====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

Whatever progress I am making, I think it is due to that. I am very glad you are doing your best to open a branch at L. A.

When I return to Delhi I shall enquire of the Gita (Gira) Press there, as you requested. If you have not done so, please send the monthly $10. Also send a few copies of the “Kirtan in the Park” circulars.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
