====== Rukmini ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Rukmini,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 23, 1969, and also I have seen your wonderful portrait of my Guru Maharaja. This picture is a great joy to me, and it is now hanging in my room in the temple where I may always gaze upon it. I thank you so much for your sincere service, and i am very much encouraged that you are already a nice artist, and what to speak of the improvements you will make with further practice.

Regarding your question about the individual soul becoming all-pervasive, the idea is completely nonsensical rascaldom. Such theory is simply a bluff. Artificially, by means of practical psychology, one can understand very little of another's thinking and feeling. But this is in no way all-pervasive. If any yogi says like that, especially the modern so-called yogis, it is simply falsehood. In however perfect stage of yoga one may be, he may understand something of another's mental condition, but this is never all-pervasive. This all-pervasive consciousness is possible only in the Supersoul.

Bhakti Devi is the expansion of Srimati Radharani. I hope this letter will meet you in very good health. Thanking you once more for your nice letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. While Jadurani is sick you can continue the work slowly. There is no rush you can paint pictures slowly but surely very nice.
