====== Purusottama ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Purusottam,

Please accept my blessings. I hope you have already received the the tape No. 36, Today I am sending the tape No. 37. You need not send me the typed copies. You can keep them with you.

Dindayal wants me in San Francisco for a few days. So I have agreed. You can talk with him by phone & ask him to send me the passage money. As soon as I get it I shall start for San Francisco because here there is no serious engagements. Of course the climate is nice & I am keeping nice here. Kartikeya is ill for indigestion. Hope you are well. Please offer my blessings to all there. The condition of the centre is not very satisfactory. So I am trying to rectify it.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta

P.S. Please send me a few copies of the photostat "Krishna Chant Startles London".
