====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. So far the marriage of Shakuntala and Ajamita is concerned, I have no objection but you must brief them thoroughly on married life in Krishna Consciousness, how serious business it is, and that separation is not allowed under any circumstances. At one marriage ceremony in N.Y. Rupanuga had the boy and girl both sign documents saying that they promised never to separate under any circumstances. So you can correspond with him and do likewise.

I have sent you tape no. 13 along with some poetry by separate post. I hope that you have received the package by now.

Please offer my blessings to the other boys and girls there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
