My dear Dr. Ghosh,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 8th, 1975 and have noted the contents. On my world tour, I have received your letter redirected to New York City. I started from Bombay on the 24th of Jan., then via Hong Kong, Japan, Hawaii, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Caracas, Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, New York, and London, now I am here in Tehran in our center as above mentioned. I shall be starting from Bombay tonight and will be staying for 2 or 3 days. Then I shall go to Calcutta from there. And after that, I shall go to Mayapur to hold our annual ceremony celebrating Lord Caitanya's Birth day. You are cordially invited to attend our ceremony there and then also our ceremony in Vrndavana. I wish that you may visit our temple along with your wife Mrs. Ghosh.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
