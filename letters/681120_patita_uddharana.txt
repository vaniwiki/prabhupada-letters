====== Patita Uddharana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter of Nov. 17, and I have noted the contents with care. Yes, I have noted that you would like to go to the New York center for some time. If you think that program is nice then I have no objection to your going there and living with the devotees in the temple there. Yes, try to convince your brothers gradually to come to the temple and take up this Krishna Consciousness. It will be a great service.

Please keep me informed of your journey, and when you arrive at the New York temple, write to me and let me know how you are doing there nicely. You can arrange for staying there with Brahmananda and he will take care of you. Hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. The enclosed note was sent to me by error, so you can hand it over to Harer Nama and he will do the needful, as it is urgent, and has to be done before the 29th of Nov.
