====== Yamuna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I received your letter a few days ago and I am very glad to learn that you are training the 2 boys in Krishna Consciousness. I do not think you require an academic degree for training such boys. We are training Krishna Consciousness, which has nothing to do with academic education; I therefore wish that instead of wasting your time for 2 or 3 years for taking a degree, you may increase your scope of activities for recruiting such boys and training them in Krishna Consciousness. But if your state laws do not allow it to hold any class without such degree then you must get such degree. On the whole you have got a very nice engagement for training children in Krishna Consciousness. And I think you are very fit for it. I am sure if you endeavor in this line of service, Krishna will be very much pleased and will shower His blessing more and more. you are very nice girl and I have got full faith in you and I wish that you can develop this line of service to the society.

If possible, please send me the address of Prasad; I want to write him one letter.

Hope you are both well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
