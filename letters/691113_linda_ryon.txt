====== Letter to: Linda Ryon ======

My dear Linda Ryon,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated October 26, 1969 and I have noted the contents with pleasure. I am so glad to learn that you and your husband, Michael, are finding your lives very happy and satisfying due to the influence of Lord Krishna. This is the position of Krishna Consciousness that if anyone will take to it seriously, he will find instant improvement in his life's condition. By nature every living entity is joyful and in Krishna Consciousness, but due to association with material contamination certain souls have gotten their joyful spiritual nature covered up by the cloud of Maya. The purpose of our centers for Krishna Consciousness is to give everyone the opportunity to remove this cloud of Maya from their consciousness and resume their natural, blissful life of rendering devotional service to Lord Krishna. The process is very simple: chanting, dancing, eating Krishna Prasadam and associating with Krishna's nice devotees. And these four items will make one advance very quickly. We are offering to everyone everything that is nice: nice food, nice family life, nice music, nice philosophy, nice association. Only a rascal will not accept this gift of Krishna Consciousness. So please continue to follow the procedures as you have been doing under the guidance of Bhagavan das, Jagadisa, and their wives. When I return to Boston sometimes in December, perhaps you and your husband will be able to meet me there.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
