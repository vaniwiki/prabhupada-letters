====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 14, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. Regarding your joining the Sankirtana Party, please wait for the time being and I shall call you at the right time. I have this in my mind. When I go to London and by Krishna's Grace we fix up for going around the world, or even if not that, if the London devotees need to strengthen their Sankirtana Party with more attractions, then your services will be required there. But in the meantime you must keep in mind to train somebody there so that in your absence he can take charge.

So far as the bowing down in Deity worship, before opening the door you should bow down. Then turn on the light and bow down again. There is no restriction on bowing down. As many times as you can is all right. Of course, your clothes and under garments should always be as clean as possible. Guests and devotees need not be wearing woolen robes to be dancing around the deities. Regarding your question about guests being present at arati, you should have as many guests there as is possible for you to get to come.

Please convey my blessings to all of the devotees at your temple. I hope this will meet you and your good wife, Himavati, in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. What about French BTG? I have asked Janardana to translate into French my B.G. Has he received the copy from Rayarama? Please ask him to write to me. ACB
