My dear Gopala Krishna das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated December 16th and 21st, 1974 and have noted the contents. The only thing I am thinking is that you are getting good money to be used for Krishna. So anyway, if you look after Spiritual Sky business, I have no objection. Hansadutta is here and I have discussed with him. I have given the decision over to the GBC men. Whatever they decide, I shall accept.

Regarding Gurudasa, he is in L.A. and has engaged himself in preaching work, so I have advised him separately.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
