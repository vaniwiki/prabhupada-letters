====== Gopala Krsna ======

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. %%___%% %%__%% great satisfaction %%____%% your letter of November 20th along with your very kind gift of one pull-over sweater. This gift is very much appreciated by me as the weather in Los Angeles is little bit cold lately and I had need of just such a sweater. Also please thank Satyabhama for her good taste of selection. I am pleased to learn how you are spending your time in meditation with Lord Krishna and I request that continue to chant Hare Krishna so that Krishna will surely bestow all blessings upon yourself.

Once again I thank you for your good sentiments and thoughtfulness. I hope that you are well and shall continue to advance in your service to Lord Krishna.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please try to improve the condition of the temple in cooperation with the members there. ACB
