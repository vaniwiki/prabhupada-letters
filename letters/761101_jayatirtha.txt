====== Jayatirtha ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Jayatirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25/10/76.

So, if we can stay at Bury Place that is Krsna's arrangement. Let Mr. Patel purchase the new property. In that case there is no need of sending the pass book. The transfer order may be torn up.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
