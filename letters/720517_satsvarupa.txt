====== Satsvarupa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received several letters from Hrdayananda requesting sacred thread initiation for Pusta Krishna and Mahamaya dasi in Houston centre. So now he has come to Los Angeles so I am sending you their threads and two copies of gayatri mantra enclosed. You may hold a fire yagna and give them both gayatri mantra. you know well how to do it.

Another thing, I am giving sannyasa to Rupanuga, Karandhara and Bali Mardan and as you have also asked me, I shall also be pleased to give you sannyasa. The others are coming to Los Angeles by the 25th May, 1972, and the ceremony will be held on the 27th May. However, as I am most probably coming to Dallas on my return from Mexico City, it is more practical to give you sannyasa order of life at that time. If possible you can also come and take sannyasa along with others.

Hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
