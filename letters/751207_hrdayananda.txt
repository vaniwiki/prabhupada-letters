====== Letter to: Hrdayananda ======

Los Angeles

My dear Hrdayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22 November 1975 and the new books in Portuguese and Spanish. They are very nice and the reports of sales are also very encouraging. If Radhavallabha Prabhu can help you that is all right, but you have to discuss this with the BBT trustees.

No you should not install Gaura nitai deities if you do not have the required Brahmins. Better wait.

Yes you print all my books, if you can sell then why not print. Print as much as possible and store them if necessary. But you must pay regularly the BBT loans that is not to be neglected.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
