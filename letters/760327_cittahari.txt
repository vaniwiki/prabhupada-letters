====== Cittahari ======

Adelaide, Australia

My dear Citta Hari das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18 March, 1976 with enclosed daksina and I thank you very much.

Now the new devotees must all be trained very nicely how to render devotional service by chanting 16 offenseless ds daily, and following the 4 regulative principles. Kindly set a nice example yourself for everyone and in this way make your lives perfect in full Krishna Consciousness.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
