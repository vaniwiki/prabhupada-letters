<card class="letter">
San Francisco

My dear Vaikunthanatha and Bahulasva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated March 1, 1975 and have noted the contents, along with the newspaper article. Thank you very much for sending this article. It is very good news. It appears that this scientist has become very intelligent. Yes, try to meet with them somehow and make arrangement for them to meet with me when I come for the San Francisco Rathayatra. That will be very nice. Such persons should be given the chance to study our books very carefully. In this way they will actually understand what is science.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
