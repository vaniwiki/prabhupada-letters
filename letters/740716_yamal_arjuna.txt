====== Letter to: Yamal, Arjuna ======

Los Angeles

My dear Yamal and Arjuna Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your note with the enclosed donation of $15 for my book fund. Thank you very much for this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
