My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. You will be glad to know that with Messrs. Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd. I have opened an account "Bhaktivedanta Book Fund Deposit" with immediate effect by depositing $5,000. At the same time I have ordered from them books worth $32,000 and as soon as the second volume KRSNA manuscript is received the amount will increase to $52,000.

Under the circumstances I shall request you to send as much as possible every week to this Bhaktivedanta Book Fund Deposit so that I may not feel any difficulty to meet my obligation.

Now you have in stock about 10,000 copies of __KRSNA,__ face value of which is about $75,000, so kindly try to collect as much as possible and send your weekly collections to this deposit fund. Immediately you can send Durlabha's $500 and whatever book fund collection you have made and let me know by your next letter.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
