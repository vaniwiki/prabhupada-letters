====== Aksayananda ======

Amsterdam

My dear Aksayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1972, and I have very much appreciated also the copy of latest BTG in Dutch language, and I have shown it to some of my Godbrothers and other visitors here. I am happy to hear all of the programs there in Amsterdam temple are going on nicely, and I think you are the best man to give all of the younger students good advice and guidance how to make advancement in their Krsna Consciousness devotional service. Now try to produce literature more and more in the native language, and introduce our philosophy into all the schools and colleges in Holland.

Regarding your questions, in the spiritual sky everything is spiritual, so Krsna has no need for living in the heart. They are seeing Krsna face to face always, so what is the use of being in heart? Outside, inside, they are the same, even their heart that is also sat-cid-ananda. There is no mechanical arrangement like this material body for anyone in the spiritual sky, what to speak of Krsna.

You can calculate how old is Lord Brahma. It is very difficult to say, but only one day of Brahma in which we are, that has not yet passed. We have come in the middle of his one day. We find in Bhagavad-gita that Brahma's one day is equal to 1000 times 400,300 years. So we are fixing his one day, so similarly he has got one night of same duration, such month, such year, similarly such 100 years he will live. He is not even yet one day old, and there are millions of Brahmas, and he is one of the smallest.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
