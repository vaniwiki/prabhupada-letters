Dear Sriman Joshiji,

Please accept my greetings. I thank you very much for your letter dated 3/5/76 and I have noted the contents with care.

Just now I am on my 15th world tour and your letter was forwarded to me here in Hawaii from my Bombay address. It will take at least 3 months to return to India. I am very much pleased that you have invited us to cooperate with you in this matter of humanitarianism. I shall be glad to know in detail what is your program. Our program is to awaken the human society to God Consciousness.

The living entity is eternal and changing body by the evolutionary process. In this material world there are 8,400,000 forms of body and the living entity is passing through the cycle. When the living entity is given a chance in the process to become a human being, he has to decide which way he wants to go.

We are preaching on the basis of the Vedic literatures, which are considered to be the most authentic knowledge by Indian scholars, religionists, and people in general. This authenticity is being appreciated now by all scholarly sections throughout the whole world. Our books are being received by all libraries, universities, and scholarly persons, and I wish also that your institution may also order for all these books so that you can understand our point of view. Enclosed is one catalog which vividly describes some of these books. They are available to your institution through our Bombay branch where address is: Hare Krishna Land, Juhu Road, Juhu, Bombay 400-054.

With reference to your statement that you are concerned with __this__ life alone, I could not follow what you mean by this. In this life also, you take care of educating your children. So if the child is not educated for the next stage of life, then how do you account for the child's youth-hood age. Life is a continuation. The baby grows to become a child, the child grows to become a boy, the boy grows to become a young man, the young man becomes a middle-aged man, and the middle-aged man becomes an old man. So with which stage of life are you concerned? I shall be glad to know in which stage of life you are interested. If you don't take care of the child and simply become concerned with the young man, is it possible to act properly in the matter of humanitarianism? And according to the transmigration of the soul, a man can become a dog in the next life. So you take care of this life, and if in the next life he becomes a dog, then what?

Immediately, of course, we do not insist on philosophy, but if people join sankirtana, chanting and dancing and taking prasadam, then immediately we can begin cooperating without any distinction of Hindu, Christian, Muslim, etc. Unless we make our program in an authorized perfect way, anything we try to do will be a failure. So I shall be glad to hear from you further in this matter.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
