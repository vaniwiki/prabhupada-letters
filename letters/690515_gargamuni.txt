====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings.

I thank you very much for your letter of May 11, 1969, sent along with the check for $250.00. You have written to say that you are still having problems in obtaining manpower for your business, and the only solution I can think of is that you engage outsiders to do this work. If you think you have a scarcity of money, then I can return the check to you, and you can utilize it. As I have mentioned in my letter to Brahmananda, I do not know how I can solve all of these departmental problems if they are all referred to me. It would be better if the department heads could work out such things amongst themselves. Today Kirtanananda Swami has left for North Carolina to take my place in lecturing there at two college engagements. This is very satisfying to me, and I wish that many of my disciples may become expert preachers so they may assist more and more in the great preaching work that we have to do for the benefit of mankind.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Successful business means it will improve in volume. Suppose you require 50 assistants then where we have got so much men. At that time we have to employ outsiders. Suppose we increase our sales of books very nice then we have take help of outsiders for binding. We cannot expect that all our men may become bookbinders. Our Krishna Consciousness program must be executed. ACB
