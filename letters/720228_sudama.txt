====== Sudama ======

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters of February 15 and 18, 1972, and I am very much glad that you are arranging so many important programs for when I shall come to Japan. Tentatively, I shall leave India by end of March and I want to spend one to two weeks in Australia, Hong Kong Tokyo, Honolulu, then reach Los Angeles by late Spring. Therefore I shall probably reach Tokyo as you have planned about end of April. But I see that you have planned a much longer program than for two weeks. If the programs are very important, then I have no objection to staying longer there. But if you can arrange for all important programs to be organized in such a way that they shall be one after the other within shorter time, that is better. I especially like your idea to speak to many students, and if they are important meetings, I have no objection to travelling to other cities in Japan, but I shall appreciate if the meetings are scheduled within shorter time and more frequently.

So far the visa is concerned for Missionary Lecturing, you may send the papers as suggested by you immediately, one for a guarantee and the other with Society seals and notarized, and as I shall be in Delhi by tenth of March for finishing up some business in Vrindaban, you may send them at once to me c/o S. K. Joshi, 4-A Kamla Nagar, Delhi-7. But I do not think there is time to get letters from Los Angeles in this regard, so you can do the needful, but main thing is that papers should reach Delhi no later than, say, 8th or 10th of March, 1972. For our part, we shall also be sending you our letter of application, as suggested by you.

My idea in the beginning was that instead of learning yourself the Japanese language, if you could convert one Japanese man that would be better for him to head up the preaching after learning from you and then you would be free to organize everything. But if you think it is better to learn yourself Japanese language, then I have no objection.

Thank you very much for the tapes which we have duly received. You can tell Bhanu that I have received his letter of February 16, 1972, and I am very glad that he has arrived there to help you. He is a very good boy, and very intelligent also, so now you engage him full-time in translating my books, and he may train other Japanese-speaking boys also to translate and preach, then everything will be successful.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.
