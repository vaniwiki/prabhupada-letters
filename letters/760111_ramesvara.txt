Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letters dated December 18th and December 25th respectively.

The quote book, "The Krishna Consciousness Movement is Authorized", is very important. From each city find out important persons names and post it. You can send it to important members of the Government, businessmen, entertainers, sportsmen, etc. Another device is that you can address it to "Any Respectable Gentleman, Post Office . . ., City . . ., State . . .". The postman will then deliver it to some respectable gentleman. Everyone who gets it will think: "I am a most respectable gentleman because he has give it to me." The best thing is to find out the customers list to some big magazine like "Time" or "Life", and post it to them. I think the post office can give concession rate for huge numbers of postings. Yes, go on adding any new important quotes in the reprinting.

Regarding the improvements of gold stamping and gold guilding on the Bhagavatams, I have already advised Radhavallabha Prabhu. Simply to make fashionable and increase the price may hamper the sales. Rather decrease the price.

That so many people are purchasing our literature in Los Angeles indicated that it is being advertised: Oh, I have got a very nice book. Then their acquaintances want the book also. The books distribution in Los Angeles during the six day period is transcendental samadhi. They are working in trance, not on the material platform. No common man can work so hard, it is not possible. Working without sleep means no death. Sleeping is dead condition. "Jiv jago, jiva jago, gauracanda bole, kota nidra yao maya-pisacira kole." Your book distribution is really intoxication.

Please thank Jagannatha suta for the 10 copies of BTG. Thank you for printing the photo of the Mauritius meeting.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
