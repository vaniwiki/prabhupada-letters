====== Letter to: Alfred ======

Teton Village, Wyoming

My dear Alfred:

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your kind letter dated November 9, 1974 and have noted the contents. Most probably I am going to Hawaii by the middle of this month of December, and I shall let you know as soon as I reach there. I shall be glad to see you in Hawaii for making some project for improving the land there.

I shall pray to Krishna for your ever increasing advancement in Krishna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
