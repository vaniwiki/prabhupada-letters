====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna, Bhavananda ======

Vrindaban

My dear Tamala Krishna and Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one letter from Giriraja, copy enclosed, and I am very much distressed why this conveyance business is not yet settled up. I sent Bhavananda there to Bombay to do the needful, and he was silent and went away. Enclosed also find my reply to Giriraja's letter. Now I want that both of you shall go to Bombay immediately for finishing up this conveyance matter immediately. Try to get bank loan, and if you cannot, make arrangements for taking five lakhs from Mr. Jayan and we shall transfer from here as per his order, duly signed by both of you, double signature.

Keep me informed daily in this connection.

Hoping this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
