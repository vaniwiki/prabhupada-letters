====== Letter to: Dr. Wolf ======

Los Angeles

My dear Dr. Wolf,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Feb. 12th, 1975 and have noted the contents carefully. I am very soon going to London and I shall meet with Hansadutta and other secretaries there. I shall seriously see that all such undesirable things may not happen in the future.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
