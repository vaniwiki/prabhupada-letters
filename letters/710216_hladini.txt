My dear Hladinidevi Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your kind letter dated 21st January, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully.

Yes, the mind is subject to so many impressions from past activities as well as so many past lifetimes, so when disturbing thoughts enter your mind you should simply ignore them. Actually the process is to always remember the Lotus Feet of the Lord, but this is not an automatic thing. It takes so much practice due to our conditioned state. The process is to follow the regulative principles and regularly chant 16 rounds. That is our strength in spiritual life and gradually all such problems will be resolved. And because you are sincerely desiring to serve the Deity, you can be sure that Krishna will help you in all respects. So simply be persevering and go on chanting attentively and all these temporary manifestations will come to pass.

Presently our Indian preaching program is going on so nicely and wherever we go, we bring our Deities. And the people are so attracted by the purity of the arati ceremony. By March 1st I shall be going to Bombay where we will be having a one week Deity installation ceremony at our new Bombay temple, the address of which is given above. I shall be returning to U.S.A. by the first week in April.

Please offer my blessings to your good husband Mahananda as well as all the other Prabhus there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
