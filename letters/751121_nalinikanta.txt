====== Letter to: Nalinikanta ======

Phoenix

My dear Nalinikanta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter of November 9, 1975 and also your telegram to Brahmananda Swami reading as follows: "ASK SRILA PRABHUPADA IF WE SHOULD BUY SMALL CHURCH IN PHOENIX TWO BLOCKS FROM UNIVERSITY WITH $15,000 to $20,000 LOAN FROM BBT. WIRE BACK IMMEDIATELY AS MAY BE SOLD SOON. NALINIKANTA." So this matter I cannot say because I do not know what money is available. You have to consult this with Ramesvara. Regarding taking sannyasa, this mentality that either I will have sex life or I will take sannyasa, this is not proper. Sannyasa means that one is finished with material life. So you have gotten married and you are in family life. So you should remain there. So you thought that by getting married you would expand your service. So you should do that. Actually all my disciples are sannyasis because they have surrendered everything in the service of Krsna.

I have read the clipping and you have also mentioned of the women wearing karmi clothes and going into sex movies and bars late at night for collecting. So this kind of canvassing should be immediately stopped.

Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following two brahmacaris as my initiated disciples. And their names are Malcolm Perey is Yamunapata das and Monte Flynn is Kalatita das. It is your responsibility since you are recommending them that they follow strictly the rules and regulations and remain strong in Krsna consciousness. They must attend the mangala aroti and the Srimad-Bhagavatam class and Bhagavad-gita class and chant 16 rounds minimum daily and also follow the four rules and regulations.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
