====== Jagat guru ======

My dear Jagat guru Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated September 28, 1976, I have noted the contents carefully.

I understand from Hansadutta Maharaja that you have gone to Dubai borrowing $400.00 dollars from him. So if you want to change your programme again, at least send this money back to him.

In the last year you have changed your engagement so many times, it is not good, better to stick to something and complete it than constantly changing. If you can carry out your original plan of collecting from Indian in different parts of the world and sending to India that would be good. Why not stick with Nitai Gaura TWSKP and make this successful?

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
