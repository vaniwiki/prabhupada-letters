====== Gurukrpa (Gregg Gottfried) ======

Berkeley

My dear Gurukrpa, (Gregg Gottfried)

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22nd December, 1970 requesting initiation, as well as the $50.00 gift for my book fund sent to Karandhara in L.A. Thank you very much. I am so glad to accept you as my initiated disciple. Your spiritual name is Gurukrpa, or one who has the mercy of the spiritual master.

Actually the mercy of the bona fide spiritual master is there equally for everyone. Just like the sun is shining equally everywhere, yet there are those who refuse to come out completely into the light. Simply if you will rigidly follow the regulative principles and chant 16 rounds of beads daily without fail and engage whole-heartedly in devotional service, your rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness will be certain.

Your beads, duly chanted on, are enclosed and should be soaked in oil (mustard oil will do) and they should be re-strung properly also.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
