====== Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. Now Bombay is requesting that more money be sent. So please send them US 50,000 to Bank of America, Bombay. Also I am told that Gargamuni Swami has pledged to send Vrindaban US 1,000 monthly but he has not sent anything this month. Please see why he has not done it yet for this month.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
