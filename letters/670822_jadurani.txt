====== Jadurani ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter along with Brahmananda's. Yes I am definitely improving, and I expect to return soon. In the meantime it has been decided by me to transform Kirtanananda into a Swami, and he may then go back to Montreal for improving the center, and for opening more centers in that country. He has no complaint now for his health, and I hope, by Krishna's Grace, he will keep well here. Please give one painting to Yogi Denkar, and charge what you like. I am so satisfied with your service for the cause of Krishna Consciousness, and I shall simply pray to Krishna for your good health, sound mind, and steady progress in the matter of K.C. Please offer my blessings to all the girls especially who are living with you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Hello Prabhus:\\
I am thanking Krishna that I am now in good health, and enjoying Vrindaban to the fullest. I have seen so many beautiful temples-but unfortunately most of them are in very bad state of repair. We are hoping (hopeing) to get one of them for our society quarters here; I know it would be nice for you all, and I think it would be a great service to the Lord. You will be interested to know that Swamiji has initiated a very wonderful Indian boy here as our first Indian brahmachari, and he is now assisting His Divine Grace personally in every way. His name is Dinesh.

love, Kirtanananda
