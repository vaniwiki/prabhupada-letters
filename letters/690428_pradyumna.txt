====== Pradyumna ======

My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 23, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am arranging for the certificates to be sent to both Hayagriva and yourself, and you should receive them before long. My travelling schedule for the next few weeks will be as follows: I shall arrive in Columbus on flight 485, United Airlines, at 10:47 on May 9, 1969. Then on the 15th of May I shall be going to North Carolina, and then on the 18th of May I shall proceed to New Vrindaban.

I am pleased to learn of your nice Krishna Conscious activities in Columbus, and I shall be happy to see you there soon. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
