London

My dear Jaya Hari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of 11 June 1974.

I am presently travelling through Europe and in the past weeks have held many programs in Rome, Geneva, Paris and now Germany. I, therefore, have no time to carefully study and decide on your proposals. The best thing is if you can come and meet with me personally after I have finished this present tour. I am planning to go to Vrindaban for Janmastami, for the opening installation ceremonies of our Krsna Balarama Temple. If you can come to see me in Vrindaban I would be glad to discuss and plan with you what is best for your devotional service engagement.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
