Laguna Beach

My dear Rsabhadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th February, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so glad to note how nicely your Sankirtana activities are going on there in Laguna Beach center. You write to say that you are considering the possibility of celebrating feast days with festivals on the street. That is very good program, so do it nicely. Aratik ceremony may be done also, if possible. Otherwise, it is not necessary. So long as there is Guru-Gauranga worship, Yamuna Prabhu may act as pujari. Otherwise, one must be initiated to tend the Deity.

It is also encouraging to note how you are arranging formal parties at professional people's homes and presenting our life membership program. That has been our program in India and it has been met with great success. So continue this program with enthusiasm and determination. We want to distribute our books as far as possible to all classes of men, because anyone who reads them is sure to become Krishna Conscious, they are so nice. Also you should distribute the books to schools, colleges, libraries, bookstores, and wherever else you can imagine that they will be received. Also continue your program of door-to-door Sankirtana. That is certainly Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's movement and he will bestow upon you all blessings.

Please offer my blessings to Yamuna,* Kapiladeva, Madhumangala, Austin, and Robbie Prabhus as well as all the other boys and girls there in Laguna Beach. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
