====== Karandhara ======

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 15th, 1973 requesting initiation for seven devotees and second initiation for three devotees. Upon your recommendation I accept them as my disciples. Their spiritual names are as follows:

Lewis: Upendranath dasa

Richard: Premarupa dasa

Sandy B.: Sanhari dasi

Sandy F.: Soubardya dasi

Merrissa: Mulaprakrti dasi

Sria: Kadamba dasi

Diane: Anandavidya dasi\\
So now you should duly perform the yajna, chanting on their beads, and instruct them carefully to follow all the rules and regulations. At the same yajna you may also perform the second initiation of the three Brahmins. This yajna is best held in the morning amongst devotees.

Herewith also find enclosed one letter from Mr. Alfred Reis written on behalf of Mr. Eustace Paul. . He wants to give us a house but wants me to come there personally. I have written to Rupanuga and Hanuman but whether they have done anything about it I do not know. The thing is that if my presence is required, then he should send round trip tickets for four. I think this will be costly, so if possible try to settle it there. You can contact Rupanuga or Hanuman of Citsukhananda.

Hoping this finds you in the best health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
