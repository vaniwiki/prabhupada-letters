====== Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejyas dasa,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed is one letter addressed to Acarya Prabhakar Misra. Please find. I do not know his address in Delhi, but I am sure that you know it. Please meet him and hand this letter over to him or forward it by post as is convenient for you. Please also keep in constant contact with Laxman S. Agarwal and his genius wife also. Try to encourage them to construct the temple in their factory as soon as possible.

Also keep in constant contact with that Oriya Minister of Defense. I forget his name. Try to get some acres of land near the Buddha Jayanti Park. I wish to develop a Janmastami Park there and invite all the residents of New Delhi there to observe a grand festival on Janmastami day. I wish to construct a grand temple of Krishna Balarama and keep many cows in this park. The residents of New Delhi will be very much encouraged to visit this park. That is my ambition. Both the Deputy Minister of Defense (the Oriya Minister) as well as Mr. Agarwal can give us substantial help in this progress.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
