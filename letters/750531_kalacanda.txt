====== Kalacanda ======

Los Angeles

My dear Kalacanda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Trivikrama 1,489 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the nice photos. I saw one photo there of Bharadraja's doll studio along with the others. You can tell him that we want many Panca-tattva Deities made out of cement or plaster paris. They can be made the same size as the L.A. Gaura-Nitai Deities.

Regarding your sarod playing, I shall hear you play when I come to Los Angeles next.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Continue doing nice plays for the public. This can be very attractive if it is done very nicely.\\
