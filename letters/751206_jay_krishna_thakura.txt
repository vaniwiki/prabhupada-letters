My dear Jay Krishna Thakura,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 30, 1975.

Yes I remember you were coming to see me daily at Bhaktivedanta Manor during my stay there in 1973. Regarding your question about my birth. I was born September 1, 1896, Tuesday at about 4:00 in the afternoon. My rasi is Metthuna.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
