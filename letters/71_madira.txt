====== Madira ======

My Dear Madira Devi Dasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18th August, 1971 as well as your check for $14.12 as daksina. Thank you very much for the same. If you have collected so much on Sankirtan from BTG distribution above the cost of the magazine, that means you must be a first class BTG distributor. That is very nice. Actually that is our most important business-to distribute our Back to Godhead magazine and if you will go on in this way with enthusiasm and determination for distributing BTG to everyone you meet then Krishna will surely bless you more and more.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
