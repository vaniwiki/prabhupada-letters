My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 8, 1973. I have noted the contents carefully. I hope that by now you have received my letter of 2/5/73 in answer to your letter of April 25. I have not received any letters from you since then.

In regards to your questions in the letter of May 8, Caitanya Mahaprabhu was going to see the temple of Visesvar and hundreds and thousands of people were following Him. He was chanting Hari! Hari! It was not on the bank of the Ganges. It was on a road. It was not a high road but very narrow. Lord Caitanya was a sannyasa should be depicted with shaven head and wearing a short dhoti with folded part in front.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
