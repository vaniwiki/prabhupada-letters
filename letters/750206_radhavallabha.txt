My dear Radhavallabha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 3, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for distributing my books everyday. This is a nice program for the press workers to increase enthusiasm.

The sample that you sent me of the new design for the BBT logo is approved by me. For the sake of consistency, you can also use it on the cover jacket.

Every volume of Srimad-Bhagavatam as well as Caitanya Caritamrta must be fully complete with an index, list of references, glossary, Sanskrit pronunciation guide, and index of Sanskrit (or Bengali) verses. This will be best.

I will be glad to see you all (at least 15 of you) in Mayapur for our festival.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
