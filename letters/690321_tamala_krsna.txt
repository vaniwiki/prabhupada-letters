====== Tamala Krsna ======

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter dated March 18th by special delivery is in hand and it is so gratifying that you have already saved $600 for the improvement of the temple. So I am very much pleased. Go on working like this and Krishna will give you ample money---there is no scarcity. Regarding the change of altar, you can do it later on, but your making up the feast room you can take care of immediately, because I understand that 70 or 80 people are coming to eat Love Feast. So if you decorate that room nicely, necessary equipment being there, it will attract more people. Regarding changing altar, I think you should postpone it for the time being unless you get Radha Krishna Deity from India. Immediately there is no need of change of altar---when the Deity is arrived I shall give you suggestion how to do it. In the meantime, a throne may be prepared just on the sample drawing by Muralidhara. My thanks are due to Muralidhara for designing the throne which I have received. Here both Gaurasundara and Govinda dasi have very much appreciated the design, and they also convey their thanks to him. Your decision to fix up the feast room first is approved by me.

I think on the receipt of this letter you will be able to finish it by the 30th of March. Yes, perform Lord Ramacandra's Birthday as gorgeously as possible. Some of the particular functions just like Lord Krishna's Birthday, Lord Caitanya's Birthday, Lord Ramacandra's Birthday, and Lord Nrsimhadeva's Appearance Day, all should be observed very nicely.

I am also very glad to learn that one Brahmacari has joined you. Please keep him nicely, because Maya's strength is very strong. I have received letter from Birbhadra and I am so glad that he writes so nicely. The certificate of his initiation is enclosed herewith.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
