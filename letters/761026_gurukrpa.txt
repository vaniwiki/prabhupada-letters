====== Gurukrpa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Gurukrpa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 15/10/76.

The behavior of Sukadeva is very bad. It is good that he has resigned. The fact is that unless the management is strictly supervised, these things will happen. Sudama and Manasvi did the same thing. Be careful so that these things may not happen again in the future. The president cannot take any loans without authorization. This is a declaration. These things must not be allowed. Whatever he has taken must be returned and he must pay back the money that he has kept. How can he claim proprietorship, everything is the property of the Guru. You must inform them wherever he has gone that he must return whatever he has taken.

Now you please stay there until you have properly trained up a competent manager and then you must carefully supervise so that this may not happen again. Hawaii is a good field so do it carefully. You have done the right thing to inform me of the situation. Thank you for rectifying the situation.

I am pleased to accept the devotees you have recommended for initiation. Hold a fire ceremony. Instruct the devotees in the necessary way. You may chant on the beads. Play the tape of me chanting the gayatri mantra, etc. Do the needful. The new initiate's name is Naga-natana dasa.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
