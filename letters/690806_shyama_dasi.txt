My Dear Shyama Dasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your nice letter of July 28th, 1969, and I am glad that you are working very hard in assisting your good husband. So my idea of combining you as husband and wife is now fulfilled, and you both continue to render your important service to Krishna. I am so glad to learn that you are preparing enthusiastically for the Janmastami Ceremony. The atmosphere in New Vrindaban created by all, especially your husband, is very nice. Almost daily I hear the kirtan sung by your husband and the prayers offered by Paramananda. So you have got a very good combination. Follow the program and gradually you will feel more and more transcendental bliss. Perhaps you have already received the memo, but on Janmastami Day there will be a test on Bhagavad Gita and Ishopanishad. I will send the test to each center, and the devotees or anyone can sit down and answer the questions, consulting Bhagavad Gita and Ishopanishad.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

PS: The prayers by Srila Raghunathadas Goswami which you have submitted to me are very nice, and they may be printed in BTG.
