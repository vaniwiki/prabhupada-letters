====== Sudama ======

Tokyo, Japan

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7th January, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully.

It is very good news that your wife has taken to learn the Japanese language. So you should train your wife like that instead of fighting and creating misunderstanding. You must tolerate such misunderstandings. Train her for useful purpose and it will be a great help to both you and the society. Offer my blessings to her.

Bruce has not yet taken his initiation. He wants to remain with us independently. I have no objection for such conclusion but unless he is properly initiated, he cannot help you either in the kitchen or with Deity worship, but he can help you in translating and other activities. Our whole process in on the basis of surrender. I think he is lacking in that spirit. So I have given my permission for him to return to Japan. Try to train him to the right path.

So far as recruiting men is concerned, we have to create men. Preaching means to recruite more and more men. This process is called __gosthananda__ which means pleasure by seeing increase of followers. So far I know, not a single Japanese has been initiated. What is the cause of it?

In my letter to your good self dated 5th December I gave my permission for Visnujana Swami to go there, but now it has been arranged that Kartikeya Swami will be going there instead. He is enthusiastic for going and will accompany Bruce Prabhu.

Yes, both the boy mentioned by you as well as Bruce may be engaged in translation work and you may start with Bhagavad-gita as planned. Our beginning is Bhagavad-gita, next Srimad-Bhagavatam, next KRSNA book, and then Teachings of Lord Caitanya. And anyone who reads these books will surely become Krishna Conscious.

Please keep me informed of your progress there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have just received your letter dated 15th January, 1971. You may send passage for Kartikeya Maharaja and as soon as he receives the ticket, he shall go there immediately. He will be going to Calcutta, so you can send the ticket there. The address is as follows: 11B. Jatindra Mohan Ave; Calcutta-6, India. Simply instruct him at what airlines office he can pick up his ticket. Bruce Prabhu already has passage money, so you needn't send a ticket for him.

Bruce has had a change of heart and the day after tomorrow, January 25th, he will take initiation. So first of all let the two go there and then after we finish our Indian business, we shall think of going to Tokyo. For the present, though, both Kartikeya Maharaja and Bruce Prabhu should be a great help to you there.\\
