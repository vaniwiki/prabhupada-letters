====== Letter to: Sudama ======

Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice letter dated 15th April, 1970, and noted the contents with great satisfaction. Today I have received the copy of BTG sent by you. Thank you very much. I have also seen the pictures and I can guess from these pictures that your activities are going very nicely. You have done good by sending duplicate copies to Brahmananda for publishing in BTG.

So from your account and pictures also, the program of the 29th appears to have been very nicely executed. I am so very glad to learn that you have some boys coming regularly and two of them are now living with you. Get some Japanese disciples and then you will feel stronger in preaching work.

Regarding your temple house, gradually as you work, as you are presently doing, the Japanese center will be another Dvaraka undoubtedly.

You should keep your aim for publishing Japanese BTG. That is the immediate need of your studying Japanese language, and that is immediate task. If the Japanese boy can translate it and you can see the final reading, that will be nice.

I am always glad to know that you are faithful in the matter of discharging the prescribed duties of devotional service like regularly chanting your prescribed rounds. This simple program will keep days. Attend our classes and routine work, regular chanting is your foothold in Krishna Consciousness.

Regarding your Government grant of missionary visas, it is very good news. Also the leaders in L.A. have already purchased their own temple at the above address.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Cintamani, Bhurijana, and all the other girls and boys there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
