My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very interesting letter dated 5th June, 1970, and noted the contents.

It is by the grace of Lord Krsna on account of your sincere service unto Him that you have got a very nice place for our propaganda center. I understand that the house is purchased by you, but you have mentioned nothing about it. So I am not very much anxious whether it is purchased or not, but from your description I understand it is a nice place.

You are personally a good carpenter, and certainly you can make good additions and alterations for our purpose.

In the meantime, if you could make some time to come here you could see personally how the Los Angeles temple is constructed by the devotees here. Everyone who comes to see this temple is very much pleased to see the arrangement.

I was expecting your newsletter which is very interesting since its beginning, and I wish that you may continue the practice.

Offer my blessings to your wife and other brahmacaris; and I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
