====== Letter to: Harikesa ======

Frankfurt

Dear Harikesa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 23rd, and examined the contents.

As for the German court case, it now appears to be suspended. So keep prepared and let us depend on Krsna.

The tendency you report of the householders living at the expense of others in our Society, is not good. One way to earn money is by selling books, they can be given a salary or commission. But if you say that they do not want to do that, yes, they should do some honest work. As an overall problem, this can be discussed by the entire GBC at Mayapur.

I am immediately engladdened when I hear of your plans to produce new German books; this is first class.

If you are getting people to chant and take prasadam in Eastern European countries, that is our great success. If you so desire, you can send manuscripts of Hungarian and other books and we can get them printed in India cheaper. In this matter you can write to Gopala Krsna Prabhu. Our movement is an epidemic. It will devour the whole of Europe and America. As for the newspapers giving bad reports, they simply take some opportunity for selling their newspaper; it has no lasting value. These countries are faced with difficulty but it is nature's law. They will be without food, water and they will be heavily taxed. There will be revolution. How long can they keep the people terrorized? It will burst. I can't imagine how people are living in such a rotten state. There is nothing like pleasure; all is morose. Only we are benedicting the fallen souls all over the world, so go on with your enthusiastic preaching and try to do good to others with Krsna Consciousness. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
