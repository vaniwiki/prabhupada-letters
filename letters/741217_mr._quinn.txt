====== Letter to: Mr. Quinn ======

Cobourg, Canada

Dear Mr. Quinn,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Nov. 1, 1974, and have noted the contents. Thank you for your kind sentiments. You are a very fortunate person that you have come into contact with our Krsna Consciousness movement. The perfection of human life is to somehow or another advance in spiritual life and achieve love of Godhead and go back to Godhead, back to home. The animals and lower forms they can not achieve this perfection of life. So in this human form of life we have to consider ourselves very fortunate and take advantage in this human form. Because in the next life we don't know what kind of body we may have; maybe dog, maybe pig, maybe tree, maybe fish. So we must take advantage of this human form of life. My recommendation to you is that you somehow or another put yourself in a situation so that you may have as much association with our devotees as possible. Either remain in the temple or visit the temple frequently with your family. If you continue to read our books very carefully and try to understand our philosophy very deeply, this is nice. Also it is a must that you chant Hare Krsna at least 16 times daily on your beads and follow all of the regulative principles that we have given. If there are any questions on these points you can discuss with Jagadisa Prabhu in Toronto or any of the devotees in Toronto.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
