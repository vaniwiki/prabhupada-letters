My dear Tripurari das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 25, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am glad to learn that in Washington D.C. temple you are engaged also in the Deity worship. It is good, and it is also a good idea of bringing the Deity of Gaura Nitai with you, as you have suggested in a chest. That is how Indian sadhus carry their Deity. They have one chest, and they use the chest on which to put the Deity by opening the doors of the chest.

Your program of adding six more men to your party is approved by me. Yes, the advanced men can distribute the big books, and the new men the smaller ones. Your entire program is approved by me. By the grace of Krsna, you can teach others at the temples to distribute the books and perform Deity worship, and distributing prasadam. You do this work with my full sanction. Yes, I have seen the bus of Visnujana and Tamala Krsna Maharajas, and it is very nice.

It is all right that Jayatirtha can arrange the Deity paraphernalia here in India.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
