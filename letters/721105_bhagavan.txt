My dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 11, 1972, and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. I am very glad to see the things are going on well in France and other places, and that you are there in Europe is a great relief for me. Now I am sure there will be some solid work in Mediterranean zone and the preaching work will be expanded nicely.

One thing is, if that printer is so cheap, why not print all our European books there? Anyway, print books, distribute profusely, and that will be the best preaching work. What will your three minutes' preaching do?---but if they buy one book, it may turn their life. So make this your important task, to print our books in French language and other languages, and distribute widely, and that will please my Guru Maharaja. Never mind it takes little time to make progress, our process is slow but sure, and we are confident that if we continue in this way we shall go one day back to home, back to Godhead.

I have received report from Mandakini, she will soon married to that boy, Anatol, so you please give her all help and advice in this connection.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
