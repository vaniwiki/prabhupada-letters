====== Saurabha ======

Vrindaban

My dear Saurabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I have received from the Punjab National Bank, Vrindaban a copy of their letter dated 14/10/74 to the Secretary of ISKCON Vrindaban regarding the opening of a new current account No. 683. I do not know anything about this account. Who is the Secretary? Who are the signatories? What is the purpose of the account?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
