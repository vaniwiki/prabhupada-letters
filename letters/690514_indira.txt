====== Letter to: Indira ======

My dear Indira,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter dated April 5, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. The sincere sentiments you have expressed are very nice, and surely Krishna will be pleased to bless you because of your nice attitude for serving Him. I think that because you are unable to tend the Deities in the temple, that you and your sister, Ekayani, may serve the small Radha-Krishna Deities which you will be receiving soon. Try to follow all the rules and regulations of Deity worship as are followed in the temple.

Please convey my blessings to Ekayani and all the others at the New York temple. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
