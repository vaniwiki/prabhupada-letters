====== Bhavananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 27, 1972, and with great sorrow I have noted the contents. I had also very much affection for Amrtananda, but if, as you report, there was some connection with Krishna at the last moment, then we have not to doubt that he will get good opportunity to advance further in Krishna Consciousness, so let us not lament. I understand there was some unstoppable attraction to the material glare, but at the same time he was strongly attracted to Krishna, so there was some very great conflict, and because he was weak in his mind he succumbed. So I think he may now get better opportunity to take it up, because he has become my disciple and has rendered some good service to Krishna.

You tried to get him back, that was an honest endeavor. So your kind of attachment for him is not material because it is related with Krishna, so that is good. Feeling loss is no mistake because of course any devotee out of our sight is a great loss.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
