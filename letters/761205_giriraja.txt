====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

Bombay

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 27/11/76.

After thorough deliberation it seems much better for us to go straight from Hyderabad to Vardha instead of going first to Bombay. There is no advantage in going first to Bombay. There is a train which goes direct from Hyderabad to Vardha called the daksina express. It goes every night at 10:15 from Hyderabad arriving in Vardha the next morning at 8 AM. This way I can leave here on the 17th and arrive in time for the meeting with Vinobhaji on the 18th morning. Ask Mr. Bajaj to send us the money for purchasing the tickets. I would appreciate to have four first class accommodations so that we may have one full compartment and the balance seven can be second class. Then from Vardha I would like to go with one assistant to Nagpur and return to Bombay by plane. The balance nine men can go second class by train either to Bombay or Hyderabad. Hansadutta is prepared to bring as many men as possible to make up the quota of ten others.

Otherwise the program as outlined by you is accepted. I am preparing now for the meeting with Vinobhaji as you have suggested.

We shall not exchange our top floor flat because we have the advantage of the roof. I also approve the suggestion to hold the pandal in Bombay the weekend after returning from Vardha.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
