====== Jadurani ======

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of December 17, 1968 and have carefully noted the contents.

Regarding Rukmini, I think that if she is desiring to marry Upendra then that idea is very nice and approved by me. If she will rather wait for awhile that is all right but in either case Upendra should be informed of her plans. It is very good sign that Rukmini is willing to submit this decision into my hands, but I think that in this country it is best if she can make her own choice of marriage plans. So whether marrying now or in the future, she will have my blessings.

I hope that you are tending carefully to your health. Please convey my blessings to your good god-brothers and sisters in Boston temple. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
