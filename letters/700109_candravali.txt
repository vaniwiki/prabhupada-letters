====== Letter to: Candravali ======

Berkeley

My dear Candrabali,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 5, 1970. I am so glad to learn that you are going to be married with Citsukhananda on Sunday, 11th January, at the Radha-Krishna Temple. I like this marriage ceremony because it has given practical proof of my ideas that boys and girls of this country better be married and engaged in preaching work. By the grace of Krishna, our centers managed by the married couples, like Boston, Hawaii, Detroit, New Vrindaban, St. Louis and Buffalo, etc., are doing very well. Similarly, when you are married, as it was discussed in Los Angeles, you also go somewhere, probably in Mexico as you desire, and organize a center there and start an edition of BTG in Spanish language. Our BTG in French language and German language are improving sales and people are appreciating. So why not in Spanish language, which you know well and I think Citsukhananda also knows well. So this is very good news. I was, since a long time, thinking of your marriage. Now Krishna has given you this opportunity. Utilize it properly and be happy. I am glad to learn that Hansadutta is going to officiate the ministerial function in the marriage, and I think he has got the tape of all the mantras in this connection. So be married, chant Hare Krishna and be happy. This is what I want.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
