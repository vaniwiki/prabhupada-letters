====== Dhrstadyumna ======

Sri Sri Radha Damodara TSKP\\
Tempe, Arizona

My dear Dhrstadyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for sending the conversation between yourself and Professor Verdu. You have talked very nicely. I have asked that the conversation and photos as well as the letter of appreciation from Prof. Verdu, be printed as a small pamphlet by the BBT. Please study carefully my books to be enlightened. You have presented our philosophy very nicely. This engladdens me that our students are presenting so convincingly. This is the way to become future preacher.

These T.V. engagements are very popular. If your bus program can arrange many T.V. shows it will be a very good propaganda.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
