San Francisco

My dear Makhanlal,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22nd May, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear how things are going so nicely there in preparation for Rathayatra festival and I have read the enclosed brochure for the festival written by you. It is very nice. So far as my going there by the 27th June, that may not be possible. Most probably I will have to attend London festival this year because three times I have attended Rathayatra festival in San Francisco and this time I have been very fervently requested to attend the London Rathayatra festival, where they are expecting 50,000 participants also. So it is not possible to attend both festivals. I will try my best to go to San Francisco also, but there is little chance. Still, I shall go to San Francisco when I return to U.S.A. So you should go on with the festival more enthusiastically, even in my absence.

Presently I am in Bombay and from here I am going to Moscow on the 20th June, for five days. From there I shall visit Paris and then London. After the festival I will be going to N.Y. and then on to Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Please offer my blessings to all the sincere boys and girls who are working so hard to make Lord Jagannatha's festival a grand success. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
