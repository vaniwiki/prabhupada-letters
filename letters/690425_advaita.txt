====== Advaita ======

My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 23, 1969, and I think your deliberation is right. I am advising Brahmananda to submit the manuscripts to Messrs. Dai Nippon under suitable arrangement, and whatever you can all get together for contributing to this purpose may immediately be handed over to Brahmananda for deposit in my book fund account. Your letter is very much encouraging, and it is worth exhibiting to all grhastha disciples, and not only to disciples, but to people in general who are simply interested in the matter of sense gratification. Our members of Krishna Consciousness society should be ideal human beings, and if they try to follow the principles, surely they will be the ideal men in the world.

In Buffalo, we had three meetings, and it was found that the students, both boys and girls, especially the girls, they were very much receptive and encouraging. Please organize the Sankirtana Party very nicely, and try to preach amongst the student community, and I am hopeful that the result will be very great. Brahmananda has taken charge of the sales department, and I hope when he is successful, you will try to open your own press for better production of our publications.

Thanking you once more for your letter. I hope this meets you in good health.
