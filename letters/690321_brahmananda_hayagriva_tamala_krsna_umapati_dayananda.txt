====== Brahmananda, Hayagriva, Tamala Krsna, Umapati, Dayananda ======

My dear Brahmananda, Hayagriva, Tamala Krishna, Umapati, Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed you will find the copy of a letter received by me from the draft board. Please read over it and decide what is to be done. You can consult together on this matter and get whatever information is required by them. And let me know in your next letter about the matter.

Hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

CC: New York, Los Angeles, New Vrindaban\\
P.S. I think I will have to reply to the Draft board by next week.
