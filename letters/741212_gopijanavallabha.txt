====== Letter to: Gopijanavallabha ======

Brooklyn

My dear Gopijanavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 27, 1974 and have also seen your letter addressed to Brahmananda Swami dated November 21, 1974. I never said that what Taitiriya was doing should be overlooked because of getting the buildings. Anyway where are the buildings? Bali Mardan says he will know who she is in the next 8 weeks, so just see he has made her pregnant twice, thrice, and he does not know who she is?

I was tolerating because she was to give the buildings. Bali Mardan said she was this and that, and so I believed. Anyway somehow or other they are out. This is nice. So you all have acted very sensibly. So go on with your Krishna consciousness business. Rupanuga and Kirtanananda Swami I understand are going there, so organize things nicely. We shall try to save Bali Mardan from this fall down. He is a good boy, but he has been mislead.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. What about getting a new building there? This I want.
