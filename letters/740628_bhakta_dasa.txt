====== Bhakta dasa ======

San Francisco

My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of June 17, and have carefully read the contents.

I am glad to hear you have been thinking of me and have arranged a nice house near the temple for my stay there. As you know, I will be arriving 6:30 P.M. from Chicago on United airlines on July the 6th. I am also looking forward to attending the grand festival of Lord Jagannatha.

You have said rightly when you write that the devotees are working to please me by distributing my books. My mission on behalf of my guru maharaj and Lord Caitanya, to spread Krsna Consciousness would never have been so successful if it had not been taken up by enthusiastic boys and girls such as in San Francisco, especially through distribution of books.

I can, however, only stay a few days in San Francisco after the Festival. I am due back in Vrindaban, India by about the 25th of July, and I wanted to visit Los Angeles as well as other cities in the U.S., so that does not leave me much time for staying in one place. My plan presently is to leave S.F. for L.A. on the 11th July. So any engagements you can make in S.F. before that time will be fine.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
