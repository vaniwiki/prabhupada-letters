====== Letter to: Mr. Fitzgerald ======

London

My dear Mr. Fitzgerald,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 21, 1975 and have noted the contents. These things should be decided by the GBC. Let them make a decision on the matter. You have already sent letters to them, so the problem is in their hands. I cannot deal with so many managerial problems. The GBC is there to releive me from so many problems such as this one. I hope that you will continue your service nicely following all of the rules and regulations and that you are chanting 16 rounds daily on your beads.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
