====== Letter to: Jagadisa ======

Toronto

My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 24, 1973, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the Regina temple, if it is already opened then maintain it, otherwise we should not open more centers at this time, especially in the smaller cities, it is better to go there with traveling Sankirtana parties, that was my point. And the deities in a moving vehicles is all right, providing they are cared for properly, so do the needful. Everything has to be done expertly that is my point.

Otherwise your report is encouraging to me, I always look forward to hearing from you.

I hope this letter will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
