====== GBC Godbrothers ======

<card class="letter">
Dear GBC Godbrothers:

Please accept our humble obeisances. Srila Prabhupada has become very disturbed at the news that Hansadutta Prabhu has closed the Edinburgh temple without consulting Srila Prabhupada and has asked us to issue the following memo.

No GBC man can whimsically do anything without consulting Srila Prabhupada, especially in the matter of opening a new temple and closing an old one. Such activities must be absolutely regulated and cannot be done without consultation of Srila Prabhupada and other GBC. In the annual meeting in Mayapur the activities of the whole year should be resolved, and the GBC cannot do more or less than that.

In addition Srila Prabhupada reiterates that all GBC must strictly follow the rules and regulations and do what Srila Prabhupada does. We must be the strict prototypes of Srila Prabhupada. We must be pure by preaching and chanting.

To close a temple is a very serious business, as well as opening one. It means that we are calling Krsna to come and reside there. Once Krsna is there, we cannot tell Him to now leave. Whimsically closing a temple means we do not understand what is devotional service and violates bhakti. Only under very extraordinary conditions can a temple be closed when there is consultation. Even then a temple is not to be eliminated but moved to an other place.

We hope this meets you in good health.
