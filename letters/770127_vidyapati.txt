====== Vidyapati ======

Singapore

Dear Vidyapati,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated January 12, and have studied the contents.

I am very pleased with your activities there and advise you to go on with kirtana. You say there is a small community there taking part in kirtana and prasadam distribution, so try to increase it as far as possible, according to time and place in the situation you find in Singapore.

You lament that you are not qualified to present Krsna Consciousness properly, but this is the qualification: hold kirtanas with your friends, read passages from my books, distribute prasadam and try to get more people to read the books. That you are already doing. You don't need to establish a temple, but gradually get funds and organize. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
