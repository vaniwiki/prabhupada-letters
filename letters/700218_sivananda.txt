My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. Since a long time I have not heard from you, but I am glad to learn that you are doing your duties nicely. I always remember your smiling face and submissive attitude. Be blessed by Krsna and be happy.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I think that many of you may go to London to participate in the Rathayatra festival there. That will be very nice.
