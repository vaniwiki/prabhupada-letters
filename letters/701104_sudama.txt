Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22nd October, 1970 and I have noted the contents carefully. I'm glad that you and Bali Mardan Prabhu have had a chance to be together and have planned jointly one center in Hong Kong. That is what I wish to see from the GBC members; that they work combinedly to open as many centers as possible all over the world. I am very hopeful for this GBC that you will work in such a way that I may be completely relieved from all management of this society. Now I want to simply begin translating. Here I am situated in a temple of Sita-Ram in a nearby suburb of Bombay. The atmosphere is very relaxing, such as I have not found anywhere else in India thus far. So in every way it is very conducive to my translating work and beginning today I will spend all my time translating. Tamala Krsna and Syamasundara are here with me as my liaison officers and the rest of the GBC members are spread all over the world. So please work closely together and do everything in cooperation.

Please send immediately ten copies of Japanese BTG as soon as they are printed by Dai Nippon. You can send them to the Marine Drive address. Thank you very much for your check for 45 dollars for my maintenance fund. Please offer my blessings to your good wife Cintamani and to all the other good Tokyo Prabhus. I hope you are well and jolly.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
