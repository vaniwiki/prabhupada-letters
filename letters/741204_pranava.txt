====== Letter to: Pranava ======

New Delhi

My dear Pranava das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 29, 1974 with enclosures and have noted the contents carefully. In a letter from Tejiyas to Brahmananda Swami dated November 12, 1974, he writes, "The land transaction is taking an extraordinary length of time." And, in a letter from Dhananjaya to me dated November 9, 1974 he writes, "There has also been a problem with the map of the property . . . and so far both parts of the map have never been presented together to the advocate. Therefore the advocate is also dubious as to the validity of the transaction." On the strength of these two letters I have dropped them idea of purchasing this land. Now it comes to light we have to deal with three separate agreements and they will not take payment from the bank. So considering all these points, I think this transaction may be dropped. On the previous reports submitted I have already dropped the matter. Also, as we have to divert so much attention to fertilize the land, I do not think it is suitable for our purpose. When I return to Vrindaban, then we can reconsider this transaction.

The documents which you sent are returned herewith.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
