My dear Bhurijana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 12, 1975 with enclosed check for $127.68. In this way you are rendering very nice service and the more you render service, the more you advance. This is the only way. Therefore the Vedic regulation is that whenever one goes to see some saintly person or to visit a temple, he must offer something. That will help him. It is enjoined that one should first of all dedicate his life and if it is not possible to do that, that one should dedicate his money. If he has no money, then he should utilize his intelligence how to spread Krsna consciousness. Or if he has no intelligence, then he should utilize his words that, "Yes, they are doing nicely. This is a nice movement." This is the process for advancement in Krsna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
