====== Abhirama ======

My dear Abhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 14, 1973. Regarding the initiations, I accept the following as my initiated disciples:

Richard Richman---Raghava das

Joel Peir---Caitanya Jivan das

Paul Baker---Sriman Pandit das

Carl Franzen---Sulochana das

Howard Wilfield---Narahari das

Neils Hertz---Vallabha Sen das

Barbara Drehl---Bhuvana Pavani dasi

Holly Franzen---Sulochana dasi

Patti Welfield---Bhagavat Sakti dasi

Maureen Hertz---Ragunandini dasi

So you take instruction from Rupanuga Maharaja on how to properly perform the yajna after he has chanted on their beads. Each disciple should go for collecting guru-daksine after the ceremony and the proceeds may be sent here c/o Karandhara.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
