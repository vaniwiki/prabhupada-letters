My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 2nd June, 1970.

You go with increasing the Bhagavat pictures according to the descriptions, and you need not divert your attention for the pictures demanded by our different centers. You can redirect such inquiries here, and as there are three artists now living with us it will be not difficult to paint the temple pictures Pancatattva, etc.

So you simply concentrate in drawing pictures from Bhagavatam etc. and keep them together because they will be needed in future for many other purposes.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
