My dear Bhagavan Das;

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5/8/74 with enclosed photographs of the house. This house is so nice. It is better than the other one. So you can purchase it.

Enclosed is one letter from one person in Portugal which I am forwarding to you for necessary action.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
