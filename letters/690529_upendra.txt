====== Upendra ======

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 27, 1969, and I have noted the contents. I do not know what I can do in these legal matters. You try your best in consultation with Tamala Krishna. I think that perennial watch-dog is playing some mischief. But the best thing would have been to change your location to the church. In the church there is everything as required by the law. So best thing is to consult Tamala Krishna and occupy the church. That is my opinion. You can give your statement to the authorities that it is a private temple, not many people come in cars, so there is no necessity of parking places; and some two or three people only come to the feasts and temple meetings. It is a private temple. Another possibility is that Ananda may be called from Vancouver to help you in maintaining the church in Seattle. You may correspond with him in this connection. Or else if you feel that Vancouver may be a nicer place, then you may join Ananda there. Please keep me informed as to your progress in this connection.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
