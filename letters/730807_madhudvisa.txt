====== Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter and enclosed check for daksina. In the meantime, I have also received a package of photographs. Your festival appears to be just like Jagannatha Puri, it is so encouraging to me to see how very enthusiastic you are working there. Yes! I shall certainly come to your Ratha Yatra Festival next year.

Regarding selling books in Karmic clothes; yes, it may be done, there is no harm. This book distribution and Ratha Yatra Festivals should go on all over the world. I want to introduce this Ratha Yatra Festival programme all over the world.

If you can actually supply the society with Gaura Nitai deities it will be a great achievement. But one thing is that you should try to find out some strong wood. In India they use Neem wood because this wood is not attacked by termites, if you can find out a similar wood there that will be best, or you may see if you can import this wood from India if it is not too expensive. When you have finished something, then send me a photograph.\\
Regarding the taking of sannyasa of Purusottama I have as yet not received any recommendation from you, so if you recommend him then I shall send the cloth, kaupin and mantra. You can make the rod there.

Yes! The accredited teacher may lead a "Gurukula" but first of all let him understand our philosophy perfectly and become himself strong.

So I thank you for your support. I have sent one letter and sample of Satsvarupa Goswami's report which I consider to be standard for the other GBC member to follow, so please see it and try to follow his example.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
