My dear Ramesvara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your BBT Trustees report dated November 11, 1975 and have noted the contents. I note that under transfers you have sent $25,000 to Gurukrpa Swami in Bombay. When was this and why was it done? Please send the details. I note that for the new printing of the abridged Gita, Dia Nippon, there were mistakes. Why there should be mistakes? Mistakes makes the book useless. You must be very, very careful. It will be detrimental to the sales.

Regarding the proposal for a new warehouse, what is the rent that you are presently paying for your warehouse? I think if you can go on renting, that is better. Personally I do not have a financial brain. But my Guru Maharaja, he prefered rented house rather than one's own house. At least India, a rented house is prefered than possessing one and that is practical.

I have received your telegram regarding the one million copies of __Back to Godhead__ printed and also the Spanish __Gita.__ This is solid work. Thank you very much. I have also received a batch of letters of appreciation from professors such as from Anderson College, Alderson-Broaddus, University of Leicester, University of St. Andres and Brandeis University. All these letters are very valuable and they may be added to the quotation book, __The Krsna Consciousness Movement is Authorized.__

Gopala Krsna has informed me that you have deducted $77,000 for the last shipment of books to India. But this was to be a gift. This money is meant for construction, so you should not deduct this amount.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Whether you think it is necessary to bring the artist Indra Sharma to U.S.A.? He says that his daughter is also required to assist him, so you will have to pay for two tickets. What will be the advantage of his coming there? So far I see there is no objection against our art work, but if you think it is necessary I have no objection. I do not want to see money wasted, that's all.\\
