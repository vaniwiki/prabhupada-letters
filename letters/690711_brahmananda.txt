====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letters dated July 7th and 8th, 1969, and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your check for $2,000. Regarding your price quotation of $5,850 for printing soft-covered editions of __TLC,__ Uddhava once quoted me a price of $3,500 for 10,000 copies without binding. Does it mean that for binding we have to pay more than $2,000 extra? In that case our men can bind it. Why should we pay extra if our men can do it very cheaply? Here in Los Angeles also I have been looking for printers who can do our books and magazines. I will let you know if there is any good result. Regarding New Vrindaban, immediately there is no program for investing in New Vrindaban until Hayagriva transfers the property in the society's name. But there is another program: Bhaktivinode Thakura desired that American disciple would come to Mayapur to take advantage of the birthplace of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. I wanted to make one American home there, and I asked for a piece of land there from my Godbrother, Tirtha Maharaja. He has simply acknowledged receipt of my letter, and there has been no other reply as of yet. In the meantime, Acyutananda has given hope of purchasing land there. If we purchase some land, it may be that some American people will construct a nice temple there and a home for American visitors. So what is your idea if we purchase some land there? But if we do something there, it must be done very nicely. Otherwise it will be an insult to your people who are so rich. People must go there to see the American home and the American devotees. That is my idea. I shall be glad to know your opinion about this. Regarding the straps on the mrdangas being tightened, I am training Purusottama das Brahmacari in this connection. Let us see if we can manage this problem by ourselves.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
