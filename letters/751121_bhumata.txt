====== Letter to: Bhumata ======

Cleveland

My dear Bhumata devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1975 and also your poem enclosed and have noted the contents. I am very glad to note your enthusiasm for spreading Krsna consciousness and that you want to increase your propaganda work. This is the main thing---to always be anxious how to spread the glories of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mission. I note that you have got this dedication and I am very pleased.

I have noted your ten requests and I think that yes, there should be a GBC man who I have delegated who can take care of these matters. So Satsvarupa Maharaja, he is the right man. Regarding your request for Krsna consciousness marriage, oh yes, certainly Satsvarupa Maharaja, he can perform the ceremony.

Regarding sending the gifts and offerings, is it cash or kind?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I think you may send to Bombay address, but you have to be careful if you are sending money in the mail. You can consult with Satsvarupa Maharaja how best to do this.\\
