====== Capt. Singhal ======

<card class="letter">
Bombay

My dear Capt. Singhal,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and have noted the contents carefully. I shall be the last man to give up the Hare Krishna Land to the rogue Mr. Nair. He has taken our money but tactfully has not given us the conveyance. He wanted to take farther Rs. 300,000 by similar tactics, but we have saved the situation for the time being.

Now I am going to Bombay on Monday and shall be staying at the following address:

C/o Karttikeye Mahadevia

Your suggestion to hold a meeting of the Life members is very much welcomed. I wish that a meeting as suggested by you may take place on the Hare Krishna Land immediately. Please come and see me on Monday conveniently after 4:30 pm and we shall talk about it. The land is still in our possession and we are not going to leave this land so easily. More when we meet.

Hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
