====== Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. You will be pleased to learn that I have got now immigration permission and identification card in Canada. So there will be no difficulty to go to USA anytime. I have not heard anything from Gargamuni, whether he is already gone to Vancouver. By the end of this month we will have to vacate this apartment, and I do not know whether I am going to London or Vancouver.

Uddhava has taken the German book, and I do not know whether you wanted it back. What about the news of the mrdangas from Dwarkin? I think from tomorrow the postal work will begin, and now you can reply by post all the news of New York.

Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
