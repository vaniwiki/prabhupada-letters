====== Nrsimha Caitanya ======

San Diego

My dear Nrsimha Caitanya,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your undated letter and I have examined the contents.

Your reports of the devotional progress of San Diego are very convincing, this combination of book distribution and public festivals is very good for bringing the people to an attraction for Krsna Consciousness. Go on holding as many festivals as possible. I am especially attracted to the pictures you have sent of Radha Giridhari, the deities of San Diego ISKCON. I have placed one picture on my desk and I am always admiring the beautiful decoration and the transcendental beauty of these deities. So although your temple may not be one of the largest you are excelling in deity worship; if you can maintain and increase this standard, everything will come successfully.

Regarding the $10,000 you are receiving shortly from your lawyer. Yes, you may keep $1,000 for the local expenses you have mentioned, and the balance $9,000 may be sent to my Mayapur Vrindaban fund which you can submit by mailing to Jayatirtha with instructions it be deposited in ISKCON Mayapur-Vrindaban fund. Thank you very much for this help in our projects to make beautiful temples in India for all of my foreign students.

Do not worry about past mistakes and falldowns. Krsna has given you a new chance in taking care of one of His ISKCON temples, so the future is very bright. There is nothing to worry about, simply yourself be ideal to all the devotees there by chanting as much as possible and following carefully all the regulative principles.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
