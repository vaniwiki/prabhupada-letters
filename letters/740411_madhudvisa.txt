====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

San Francisco

Dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 31, from San Francisco and I have noted the contents.

I do not think that you have failed in your work there, but by your going and preaching it appears the temple life has much improved. That you could not convince Bhutatma to stay as president is not your fault. Now you stay at New Jagannatha Puri, your first spiritual home until you are sure the new president, Bhakta dasa is fully understanding of how to conduct things. I know he has done nicely in San Diego. One thing is they should never consider leaving or selling that building, but they should stay there as Radha and Krishna are staying, and it is a nice temple as evidence by the fact that over 250 people attended the Sunday feast by your report.

The description of the play, "The Death of the Yadus" is all right.

I have written you earlier that my plans are to travel to Paris by mid May and then spending 4 or 5 days in each place, I will visit Geneva, Rome, and three or four cities in Germany. Then I will be prepared to go to Australia for Rathayatra. So let me hear from you in this regard.

I am glad you have cleared your visa matters and that you can return to your GBC zone of work.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
