====== Letter to: Bhakta dasa ======

San Diego

My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated, along with requests for initiation by six persons. Upon your recommendation, I am gladly accepting them as my duly initiated disciples and their letter follows. Now you must take the full responsibility to give them all guidance and facility for perfecting their lives in Krishna Consciousness. The trick is to keep everyone always engaged happily in Krishna's service, then they will advance rapidly. Just you become very serious and thoughtful and learn this art how to engage everyone very nicely.

I am very pleased to hear from you that book sales are increasing very fast. I am hearing such good news from all over the Society, and this pleases me more than anything.

If Krishna is giving you the means, why not purchase that nice building for our temple? You may send me some pictures of that place, but I have no objection if you purchase as the terms seem very reasonable as well as the price.

I hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
