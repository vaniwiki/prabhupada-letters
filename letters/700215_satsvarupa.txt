My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9 February, 1970, and I have also received the two tapes sent by separate mail.

I have sent a few tapes to Bhagavan das. He sends to you his edited copies and they may be made final. I want two editings only, just to see if there is any grammatical or spelling mistake. Your present program of two editions first by yourself and then by Jayadvaita is a nice arrangement. Jayadvaita has good knowledge.

In this connection, I may inform you that I have heard there is some difficulty for working on our press. I was talking yesterday with Gargamuni that the press will require an investment of great amount of money to keep it going on nicely, so please let me know what is the actual position. I understand there is some confusion about the press working and it is also understood that this confusion is due to my direction. I do not know what they mean by this. Yourself, Brahmananda, and Advaita are appointed as three directors of the press, and why there should be confusion on account of me? So many things daily I here from Gargamuni and he again speaks to Brahmananda, so let me know clearly what direction you want from me in writing.

I have written to Hayagriva to send the manuscript, typed or untyped for being submitted to Dai Nippon immediately. If Hayagriva does not send it immediately, I think the duplicate copy which is with you may be submitted. The number of pictures to accompany the 400 pages text is 52 (__fifty two__) not __50__ as you have written. I want that the manuscript and the pictures be submitted to Dai Nippon without delay.

You write very nicely, I have seen you articles. In that way you may take out so many purports from Srimad-Bhagavatam and write nice articles upon them.

Yes, it certainly requires many leaders to manage the many affairs of a large scale institution, so you must train up whatever men you have got and try to manage this way. Now we are increasing, and with the increment we must make arrangement for carrying on very nicely. At the same time we should see that all the members are chanting regularly, that is our strength, and following the regulative principles strictly. Maya is very strong. If we do not keep ourselves fit by chanting Hare Krsna, we may fall a victim at any moment.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
