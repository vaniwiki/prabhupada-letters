My dear Sudama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 25, 1974 and have noted the contents.

It is good news that you have so sufficiently taken possession of the 40 acres of land there in our society name, under control of Gaurasundara. Now you require $5000.00 to cover expansion for cows, farming and unpaid debts of Gaurasundara. As for the devotee, Bhavatarini Devi, who is there, she has asked me what to do with her large inheritance of $41,000.00. I have asked her to deposit it in our Mayapur-Vrndavana Trust Fund which we have at the Liberty Bank in Honolulu. Now you can withdrawal $5000.00 required by you from this balance by the Mayapur-Vrndavana Trust at the Liberty Bank. The account number is 35785.* I am enclosing one withdrawal slip authorizing you to make the above withdrawal.

Please keep consulting with Bali Mardan on financial matters. It is possible that I may stop at Honolulu sometime in July on my way to Rathayatra Festival, Australia. I will keep you informed. Acknowledge receipt.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enclosure: one withdrawal form $5000.00.*Please return this amt by $1000.00 per month at least
