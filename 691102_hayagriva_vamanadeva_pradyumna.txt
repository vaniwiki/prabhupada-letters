My dear Hayagriva, Vamanadeva, and Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 28, 1969. I have received also a spearate letter from Vamanadeva who is going to open a center in St. Louis. The list of proposed centers in different places is very encouraging to me. My aim is that I want to start at least 108 centers during my lifetime. So there are about 23 centers already existing, and your list completes another 16. That is very encouraging, and if factually it is done under a suitable scheme by your mutual cooperation, I have all approval for this, and you can do the needful.

I hope this will meet you all in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
