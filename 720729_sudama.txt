Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 17, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I am very glad to hear from you after such long time that things are going on nicely in Tokyo, that you are registering the Society there, getting a new place in central location, and selling many books and magazines. I have seen the Japanese "Easy Journey" and it is very nice. Yes, the Life Membership program should be started up as soon as possible, and you can enroll so many of the Indians living in Japan for giving financial and other assistance.

Regarding printing Bhagavad-gita in Japanese language, first you get it translated and ready for printing, then we shall do the needful. Now that Kaushika is there, keep him nicely and engage him as he likes, he has got good experience.

Regarding your question, all should offer due respect to a Sannyasi. His position is always superior to all other inmates of the temple. He must always maintain that superior position by action & behavior.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
