====== Letter to: Hayagriva ======

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings, and offer the same to Kirtanananda Swami. I hope you are both well and your program for constructing New Vrindaban is going nicely. I am always very much anxious to hear how you are progressing in this connection and please therefore keep me informed.

Just on Saturday, several devotees have arrived from San Francisco: Mukunda, Janaki, Gurudasa, Yamuna, Syamasundara, Malati (and their little child, Srimati Sarasvati devi), and Saradia, all of them have come here for two weeks to practice together as our Sankirtana party, then they will all go to London and begin preparations for our center there. They are all ready for opening up a center there, so we are going to try to make it as successful a venture as Krishna desires. While they are here, we are having rehearsal of Kirtana daily, and I want also that they shall practice rehearsal of your play, about Lord Caitanya's activities. So if you can send a copy of your drama as soon as possible, they will begin rehearsing how to do it.

Please send it immediately if possible, and I shall keep you informed how they are progressing in their presentation of it.

Hoping you are both well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
