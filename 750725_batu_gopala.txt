My dear Batu Gopala dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 16, 1975, and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation, I am hereby accepting the following as my initiated disciples:

Shombe Lumkin---Sri Lanka dasa

I also accept upon your recommendation the second brahminical initiation for Murari Caitanya dasa. His sanctified thread and mantra sheet are enclosed. Please have a fire sacrifice and impress upon them that they are accepting vows before Radha Krsna, the Spiritual Master, and the assembled Vaisnavas. The mantra should be heard through the right ear from my recorded tape.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
