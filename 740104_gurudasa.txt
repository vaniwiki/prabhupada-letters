Vrndavana

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. Regarding Vrindaban affairs I have written one letter to Tejiyas a copy of which is enclosed.

I am coming soon to see that the Vrindaban construction is finished by Janmastami. I will take care of the necessary funds. In the meantime, do the needful now to purchase all the materials.

I have received a letter from Bishan Candra Seth requesting to advance his brother Mr. Kapoor up to 5,000 Rupees but I am replying him that he may be advanced 1,000 Rupees to be returned at the rate of 50 Rupees per month from his salary.

Besides that I wrote you one letter regarding my account in the Punjab National Bank. I have not heard anything from you in this. A copy of the letter sent to you previously is enclosed herewith.

Hope this finds you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
