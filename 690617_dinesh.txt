My dear Dinesh,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received your letter dated June 13, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I quite follow you that you are planning to work conjointly with our London party. So I am sending you back the agreement duly signed by me, and I hope you will do the business side of these records with the Grace of Lord Caitanya. If you wish to go to London, I have no objection. The Sankirtana picture which you sent, I do not follow if you want to print this picture in the next album cover, or what is your idea of sending it. Anyway, it is very nice, and I thank you for enclosing it. Please immediately send to me one copy of the contract so I may keep it here in my files.

Convey my blessings to your wife and child. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
