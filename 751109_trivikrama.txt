My dear Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 30, 1975, and I am glad to hear from you, that you are carrying out my order there in Tokyo. What is this stealing and violence. This is not good. By stealing, did Gurukrpa Maharaja collect that money? Stealing is not our business. Our business is to become Krsna conscious. Caesar's wife must be above suspicion. This is our program.

I am writing a letter to Sacideva instructing that Sukadeva should send him immediately to you in Japan. What is that pleasant surprise?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
