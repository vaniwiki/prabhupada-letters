My dear Kulasekhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated December 2nd, 1969. I am pleased to learn that things are going nicely there. Please follow the routine work as you are doing now and everything will be pleasing and smooth. That is sure and certain. Whenever there is doubt or question, just discuss this amongst yourselves, and if there is no satisfactory solution, you refer to me. But live in Krishna Consciousness. That will make you happy.

I am very glad to learn that Visakha is fully engaged in taking care of the Deities. Please offer my blessings to her and try to behave with her as a very kind husband. She will be a very nice girl, helping you both materially and spiritually. She is a very nice girl. Regarding your questions about pujari, pujari means who will always be with the Deities. That is pujari. So far as the difficulty with bathing, you can heat up some water in the morning and wash yourself over with a sponge or a cloth.* That will be all right if there is no hot water for regular showers.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*In special cases you can simply wash your hands and feet and change your dress washed. That will purify you.
