Los Angeles

My dear Lilavati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 3, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I am very glad to hear that you are happy in your service in Los Angeles. Your letters show that you are very much talented in writing, so my proposal is that you engage yourself in editorial work. Or if you like, you can learn elementary Sanskrit, and when I come there we shall see how it can be put to use. Your book distribution program is very much encouraging to me. The more such literatures are read and distributed, the more auspicity will be there in the world. Please continue this program with ever-increasing enthusiasm.

I am leaving on the 31st of this month for Australia, and I plan to be in Los Angeles by the end of April.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
