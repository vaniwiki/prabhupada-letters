My dear Radhavallabha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated. Now you are preparing the publications of Vol.1 and Vol.3 of Caitanya Caritamrta. As far as subtitles all the volumes should have on the cover just as it is on the cover of Vol.2, "The Pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu". As for the subtitle on the inside title page which is now printed in Vol.2 as "Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the renounced Order of Life," you can make a subtitle suitable according to the subject matter of the subsequent volume. But the phrase "The Pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu" should appear on the cover of every volume.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
