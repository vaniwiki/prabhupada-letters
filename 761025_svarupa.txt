My dear Svarupa Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 20/10/76.

As soon as everything is complete in the matter of registration of the "deed of gift" and the land is in the name of ISKCON, we shall begin immediately. Please communicate to Jayapataka Swami in this connection and he will inform me of the situation.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
