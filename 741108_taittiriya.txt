====== Letter to: Taittiriya ======

Brooklyn

My dear Taittiriya devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. With further reference to your letter dated September 11, 1974, I beg to inquire whether you have taken possession of the house at 5th Avenue, and if not please let me know why it is delayed. Please send Bali Mardan with detailed information and necessary documents.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
