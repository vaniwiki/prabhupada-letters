My dear Vic,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil.

Thank you for the nice sentiments expressed therein. Go on chanting and reading our books, and gradually you will advance in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
