My dear Dixit das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 23 July 1976 and have noted the contents with care.

Thank you very much for offering your services at the new university, but first let us get the opportunity and as soon as we start the establishment it will be a great pleasure.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
