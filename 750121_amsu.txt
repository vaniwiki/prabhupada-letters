My dear Amsu das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 10th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for distributing my books in such severe conditions of cold. This is Krishna Consciousness. No matter what the conditions, still a devotee will always try his best to please his spiritual master and Krishna.

I have accepted Kati McIntosh as my initiated disciple. Her name is Karanakarana devi dasi. Her beads can be chanted by Kirtanananda Svami.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
