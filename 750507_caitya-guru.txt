My dear Caityaguru dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 14th, 1975 and have noted the contents. For some reason or other, I have received your letter very very late, otherwise reply would have been much sooner. Anyway, I am very glad that you are feeling very much encouraged working in Africa. If you follow all of the rules and regulations very carefully and continue in this way then you will always be successful.

Regarding the program in Punjab, that may be possible to hold in the fall when I will be in Vrndavana.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
