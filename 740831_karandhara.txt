Dear Karandhara Prabhu:

Please accept my humble obeisances. I have received your letter with enclosure dated August 21, 1974 and presented your proposal to Srila Prabhupada of his writing a memo to the negligent temples. The following was his reply:

"I am not going to manage Spiritual Sky. This is ridiculous. Why they are dragging me into the management. Now the acharya is meant for handling business? Jayatirtha should handle this. He is the manager. Jayatirtha and Karandhara are the chief men. they should manage. Why I have to manage? They have big, big brains. Why they are failing? Now the Founder-Acarya has to manage. Without my consent the BBT has financed."

He has suggested that the GBC take steps to correct the Spiritual Sky mismanagement, and that local GBC men request the temples under their jurisdiction of those listed in your letter to pay instead of Srila Prabhupada writing himself. He said that this is not the business of the Founder-Acarya of ISKCON.

A memo to all GBC is being sent in this regard.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your servant,\\
Brahmananda Swami\\
Personal Secretary
