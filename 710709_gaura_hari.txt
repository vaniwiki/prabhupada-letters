My dear Gaura Hari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Yes, I am so glad to hear about your travelling Sankirtana Party. That is very good news. So engage yourself in this program whole-heartedly. I have got all my blessings on you and the other members, so do everything nicely.

And it is very encouraging to hear that so many new devotees are coming. That is an indication of your sincerity. The more sincere you are in pushing this movement forward, so Krishna will reciprocate and send you many new devotees. Thank you very much. So give them protection and instruct them so that they may not go away. We recruit devotees with great difficulty. So they must be well-treated. New men may not always behave so nicely but we must be tolerant. To train a new man is like training a wild animal to be a pet. Just like the tiger is trained in the circus and later on they are dancing to the tune of the master. So the point being stressed is training. A preacher should always be tolerant.

I am so glad to hear how nicely Tulsi is growing. That is the sign of substantial devotional service. Every center should be encouraged to grow Tulsi. If there is any impediment in growing Tulsi, that means that devotional service is defective. Yes, Jagannatha Deities may be carved and installed later on. So I will give you instructions how they should be installed. First of all, let them be carved.

I am so glad to accept the devotees recommended by you for initiation and their beads and letters are enclosed herewith.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
