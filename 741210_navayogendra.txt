My dear Navayogendra das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your Diwali card forwarded to me from Mayapur. So I have received reports that you are doing nicely there in Nairobi, making Life Members daily. So you are a experienced preacher and this is to your eternal credit. If we can do something even a little thing, in the service of Krishna in this life, then it is considered that this life is a success. So you are sober, intelligent boy, you can understand our Krishna consciousness movement. Please work with continued enthusiasm, strictly following the chanting of 16 rounds daily and maya will never be able to touch you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
