My dear Mrs. Cline,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your kind letter dated February 18, 1969, and I am so glad to go through it. Certainly you are blessed by Krishna, otherwise you could not write such nice things although your connection with our movement is very recent. When you write to say "what was once 'our' home, we recognize now as Krishna's," it appears that from the past you were already advanced in Krishna Consciousness. Somehow or other the path became obstructed, and now again you have come to your consciousness. Please therefore do not miss this opportunity and continue your present state of consciousness in association with Pradyumna. For the time being, Pradyumna is alone there, and your cooperation with him will give him strength, and I shall be very much obliged to you.

Next time when I go to Columbus, surely I shall initiate you and your good husband. I understand that your husband is a student of psychology, and Krishna Consciousness is the summit of psychological studies. From the Srimad-Bhagavatam we understand that Krishna is the Original Consciousness and the center of all psychological movement, namely thinking, feeling and willing. We are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Thinking, Feeling and Willing, but our present thinking, feeling and willing being contaminated by the cloud of ignorance, we are thinking, feeling and willing in a perverted way. The whole Krishna Consciousness movement is an attempt to divert the same thinking, feeling and willing to their original unalloyed position. You are an educated couple, and your cooperation with this movement can help tremendously to propagate this most necessary and urgent message for the human society.

Thanking you once more for your kind letter. More when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
