Sri G.L. Kapoor;

Please find below my testimonial in honor of Sumati Morarji.

"Madame Sumati Morarji is a great friend of our Krishna Consciousness Movement. I first met her in connection with the printing of my Srimad-Bhagavatam and she was so kind as to immediately pay me 500 Rupees for it. Later on, in 1965 when I wanted to go to the USA, I appealed to this benevolent lady again to carry me aboard one of her ships to New York, and she immediately arranged for it. I was able to start for the USA on account of her kindness and taking some books with me I safely reached on September 19th, 1965.

When I returned to INDIA in 1970, she gave me a good reception in her office building. Many nice gentlemen also met me at that time. I feel obliged to this benevolent lady in so many ways for her helping this Krishna Consciousness Movement. I wish that Lord Krishna may give her a long life fully engaged in the service of the Lord."

Thanking you,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
