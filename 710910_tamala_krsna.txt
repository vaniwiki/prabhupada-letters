My dear Tamala Krishna

Please accept my blessings. You will be interested to know that this evening I will be going to Kenya, East Africa. The Mombassa address is given above. Some program has been fixed up there and I have consented to go there for some time.

By now I had expected some letter from you. I am anxious to know how things are going on there. So please let me know at the above-given address. Any letters you have already sent to London address will be forwarded there directly.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
