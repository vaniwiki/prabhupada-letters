My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated March 25, 1977 along with the copy of "Readings in Vedic Literature."

Yes, that is our aim, to destroy the position of the mundane scholars. Mundane scholars are called adhyksik, which means simply sense perceivers, no realization. Everyone has appreciated the substance of your book. This shows you are expert. Although you have quoted so many rascals, you have not become polluted nor has your book. Therefore I have sent you to Los Angeles for being the editor of Back To Godhead. Stick to your principles and be Krsna conscious. We have to prove to the world that anyone who is not Krsna conscious is a duskrtina and mudha. It is very good news that the book will be taken by many colleges and high schools as a textbook.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
