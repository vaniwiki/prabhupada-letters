My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your report of Press activities dated 7th October, 1971 and have noted the contents. Also I have received "Answers By Citing the Lord's Version" and it has come out very nice. The new binding procedure is also very good. In some pages there are printing discrepancies.

Regarding Bhagavad-gita, if the Morocco binding is as costly as the hard binding, then we will prefer hard binding. That is already advised to Karandhara also about printing more copies. He knows all the details.

So far ISKCON Press Europe, that was simply imagination. It never took shape. So it is better if you amalgamate it. This matter and similar topics should be consulted properly with you and the GBC members for the proper course of action. And for meeting your expenditures, taking on commercial printing jobs sounds all right. If you can maintain in this way and at the same time go on printing our books, that is our success.

You will be interested to know that here Giriraja with the help of one Bengali professor and John Greisser the photographer have published a very nice edition of Bengali BTG. The price also is not very high; almost on the level of Dai Nippon. Ordinarily Dai Nippon charges 10 cents, so it is almost on the same level. It will be published regularly henceforward, so if they require any help from you, you should give them all assistance.

Yes, I have received Rayarama's letter and I have duly replied it. Also I am very glad to hear how the work is going on steadily. It is all very encouraging. Continue it and Krishna will surely bless you all.

Please offer my blessings to the other press members.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
