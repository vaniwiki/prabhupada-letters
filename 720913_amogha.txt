====== Letter to: Amogha ======

Djakarta

My dear Amogha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Djakarta dated August 29, 1972, and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. I have also recently received one letter from the Djakarta Krsna Consciousness club and it is very nicely offering respects on Vyasa Puja occasion. I have replied them duly. I am very glad to hear that your mission is resumed in Indonesia and that you are taking up this work again with full enthusiasm. And the response has been very good there. Now go on teaching in this school and distributing our literatures more and more, and try to recruit some local men for becoming our disciples and helping you there. For relying upon devotees from outside to come there is not very practical business. It is better to recruit some local men and train them to do the work. But I think Madhudvisa can supply you with one or two men conveniently, you may request him this.

Regarding my coming there, I do not think it will be possible to stop on that side when I return to India this time, but when I shall return next year I shall be very happy to stop in Djakarta and see how the things are going on.

Now you are working very seriously and sincerely for Krsna, and you have taken great risk and courage to work in far off place on His behalf, so you may expect that He is giving you His all blessings at every turn and will continue to fix you up in the bliss of His devotional service more and more.

Hoping this meets you and your good wife Rasarani dasi in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
