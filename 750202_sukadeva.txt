Seattle

My dear Sukadeva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 24, 1975 and have noted the contents. If you can acquire that building in Seattle, it will be very nice. Jayatirtha like it very much and he recommended that you should be given the loan for 10,000 dollars. So, if it is there you can take it.

Regarding my coming there on this tour, I think it will not be possible this time, but maybe next time after Mayapur and Vrndavana festivals when I come back to the U.S., I can come there and visit you temple.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
