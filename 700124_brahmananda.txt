My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for a letter Dated 21 January, 1970 with enclosure of BTG and "Isopanisad."

Regarding BTG, I have already sent you my remarks in my last letter to you and it appears that it is not to the standard of Japanese printing. The cutting of the magazine is not uniform and the paper is lighter. Anyway, this is the first attempt, so there is nothing to be disturbed. Let us improve more and more, but we must always remember the standard of printing and also we should keep this motto in view that to have our own press means to do nicer work than the outside printers.

So far the first plates of "Isopanisad" are concerned, I am glad to say that the printing is very brilliant and the paper is very nice. Now if the cutting and binding becomes as good, then it will come out a first class specimen of our work.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
