Calcutta

Dear Sudhindra Kisora Roy;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 18, 1975. It is very nice that you are chanting Hare Krishna and are very enthusiastic to read our literatures. Please take part as much as possible in the activities of our Calcutta temple there. Attend the arotrikas and the classes and read my books very carefully and chant on the japa mala beads 16 rounds daily.

When I come to Calcutta next you can come and see me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
