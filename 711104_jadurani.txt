====== Letter to: Jadurani ======

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 24th October, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far whether to print posters, of course paintings are always nicer, but if posters can be printed I have no objection. If good printing is done, as you have described, then where from the money will come? So whether such investment is possible; you should consult with Rupanuga in this connection.

So far the prints you have sent photos of, they are bona fide but for the ordinary man they appear sensual. So better not to display such prints or paintings, not even in our temples.

Yes, one should always be engaged in important work as much as possible. Bharadraja is expert in so many things; he is expert kirtana leader also. So if he is needed for these related fields then let him devote part of his time in that way.

Acyutananda is preparing those prayer booklets from here. You needn't divert your attention in that way. So far the painting of Bhismadeva, you can show flowers actually falling from the sky. That is nice. And Lord Rama's arms should be kept in the original position, as is depicted in the print sent by Gurudasa. The arms must remain symmetrical.

Please offer my blessings to Muralidhara, Bharadraja, Kancanbala, Ekayani, Kirtimati, Sarita, and all the other hard working artists. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
