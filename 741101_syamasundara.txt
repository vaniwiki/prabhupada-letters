My dear Syamasundara das Prabhu:

Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10/10/74 and have noted the contents. Just now I have come to Bombay from our temple at Sri Dhama Mayapur. There is not negotiation going on that I may go to Bhuvaneśvara by the beginning of the month of December. At that time if you find it convenient you can come and see me. I will send you my address upon my arrival there.

Regarding the magazine, if you become a subscriber, then I can get it for you. Free distribution of the "Back to Godhead" has stopped now because it it too expensive. The yearly subscription fee is Rs. 33/- only.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Faithfully yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
