My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12th January, 1971, and I am very glad to hear from you after some time.

In the meantime our program for touring India has been going with all success in every place we are invited. Now we have come to the Ardha Kumbha Mela at Prayag and we have got undisputed prominance amongst all groups here in the large gathering. So things have gone on considerably and so it is a little late at this time to continue our older plan for a charter flight from London with party to India because our program is almost complete. So no flight should be booked at this time.

Regarding the Regent's Park land, I am very hopeful of your efforts to secure permission from the Queen and we are duly contacting Sri Karan Singh, who is already known to us, very shortly as you have suggested. So for the time being you should try to improve our London Yatra as far as possible and increase the distribution program of our books. These are more important business than India. And the land in Regents Park is also important.

I am expecting to return to U.S.A. very soon, so I shall most probably see you in London and then I shall give further instructions.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
