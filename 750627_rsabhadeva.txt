My dear Rsabhadeva dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 22, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am accepting the following for second initiation as twice born brahmana and their threads are enclosed duly sanctified: Anatacharya das, Gupta das, and Rasatoonga dasi.

I also accept the following as my disciples and their spiritual names are as follows: Arthur Davis---Arka dasa; Ken Kilmer---Kumunda dasa; Kim Kilmer---Kundara dasa; Racy Niciu---Rucirangada dasa; Robert Queen---Rama Sriyah dasa; Russel Noles---Radhapati dasa.

Please see that they are all chanting 16 rounds on their beads and following the rules and regulations. We have to become very strict in this matter. To go back home, back to Godhead is not an easy thing. It requires great discipline of body and mind, and performance of pure devotional service.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
