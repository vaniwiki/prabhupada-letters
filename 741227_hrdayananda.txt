My dear Hrdayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 17, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully. Also I have received the books newly printed in Spanish language; __Krsna,__ vol. 1, __Beyond Birth and Death__ and the new Spanish BTG. The printing job is done very nicely. I hope to see many, many more of them coming in the future. Especially as you mention in your letter, __Bhagavad-gita__ complete by the Mayapur festival this year. That will be very nice.

It is very good that people are pleading for devotees to come in Brazil. You should send some competent men there to help direct them and establish two centers there if possible.

As far as my coming there is concerned, I can come immediately. And the programs that you mention in your letter would be very nice. Try to arrange many such programs with all different kinds of respectable gentlemen, philosophers, scholars, educationalists, etc. We will be coming by way of London where we will probably stop for a few days. Also we will be stopping in Bermuda on the way from London to Mexico City for one or two days to have a program there if it can be arranged. In this connection we have contacted Rupanuga das. One telegram has already been sent to you to inform you of this and to request tickets immediately. If you have not sent the tickets as of yet please send them without delay. The tickets should be sent to the Quantas office in Bombay. They should be Bombay to London by Quantas Airlines, London to Mexico City by British Airways or Quantas if possible, via Bermuda and Nassau. The tickets should be open so that we can make reservation as is necessary according to our schedule. The tickets should be made out to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, Paramahamsa Swami and Neal Gorton Delmonico. Three tickets are required. If you wire them to the Quantas office in Bombay it will only take a few days. If you can arrange nice programs in Brazil then I will also be very pleased to go there. It sounds as though the people there are very eager for Krsna Consciousness. So let us have a program there also.

Thank you again for printing so many nice books. Continue distributing them in huge quantities and Krsna will shower His blessings.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
