Dear Sacimata devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6 February 1976, and the copies of the newspaper. Thank you very much. I have instructed that these copies be displayed in our international literature display at our festival in March. Please continue with the nice work.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
