Dear Bhavatarani;

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 24, 1974, and I have noted the contents.

I can understand that due to material circumstances you are feeling distressed, and this large sum of money which you are about to receive is also causing you distress because you don't know what is the best thing to do with it. I very much appreciate that although you are filled with doubts and suspiscions and although you have many of your own plans for what to do and how to live, you have, nevertheless put the matter before your spiritual master and asked him to direct you. This is a great qualification, and this attitude made Arjuna eligible in the Bhagavad-gita, to receive the full mercy of Krsna's instruction.

If you are actually going to receive $24,000 I think the best thing is to contribute it to the Mayapur-Vrindaban Trust Fund which you can do either in the U.S. or in India. You have learned from the devotees who have been here, what a large scope our plans are for these two centers in India. During the festival hundreds of devotees from countries all around the world all very much appreciated that these transcendental spots, Mayapur and Vrindaban are place of spiritual inspiration for all devotees of ISKCON. They are the best places in the world to come and chant Hare Krishna and prepare for going Back to Home, Back to Godhead. So you can help by your contribution so that all your Godbrothers and Godsisters can come and find shelter here. As for yourself and your child, these places are for you also. You can come to Mayapur where you can have a separate room, also Bombay this facility is there and it is very comfortable, or Vrindaban, or L.A. or wherever you choose. My only desire for my disciples is that they chant Hare Krishna Mantra at least 16 rounds, follow the rules and live in association of devotees then you will be happy and peaceful and not disturbed.

As for money for Hawaii, that we will arrange in a different way. You can consult with Sudama Maharaja how to send money to the Mayapur Vrindaban Trust Fund whether through the Los Angeles Union Bank, which can be handled by Jaya tirtha, or direct to my account in Vrindaban. I will be glad to hear from you further in this matter. You have already done much service in raising two children and sending them to Gurukula, so you should not be so disturbed by temporary inconveniences. You can also arrange from this contribution to go on paying tuition for your children at Gurukula, as far as possible.

You can write me if you have any further questions.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
