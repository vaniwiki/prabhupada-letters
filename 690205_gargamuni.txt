My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. After a long time, I beg to thank you for your letter dated 31, January, 1969 from the Spiritual Sky store. You have given a very nice name. At least you are giving ideas to the people in general that there is a Spiritual Sky, and they will get information sufficiently about Spiritual Sky, the planets thereof, the inhabitants of these planets, etc., through the medium of your store, the Spiritual Sky.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your check for $110 being the sales proceeds for __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ I am so engladdened to hear from you that the books are selling very nicely. Regarding the eight Gopis and my Spiritual Master, I think you did not follow what I said, but that does not mean that you should be disappointed. We are all students, and we are apt to commit mistakes; but that does not mean that we should be disappointed. Lord Caitanya also presented Himself before Prakasananda Sarasvati as a foolish student of His Spiritual Master, although He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Anyway, the actual fact is that the eight Gopis are as good as Krishna and Radharani. Therefore, no Vaisnava will claim to be one of the eight Gopis because that will tinge one with Mayavadi philosophy. If somebody says "I am Krishna." or "I am Radha." or "I am one of the eight Gopis." that is against Krishna philosophy. My Guru Maharaja claimed to be one of the sub-devotee assistants of the eight Gopis. Lord Caitanya also claimed Himself as servant of the servant of the servant of Krishna [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|(Cc. Madhya 13.80)]]. So even though you might not have understood, you can correct it now and don't be disappointed.

Your humble repentance is just like a Vaisnava student, so I thank you very much for this humbleness. Lord Caitanya taught us to be humbler than the grass on the street and more tolerant than the tree. So these symptoms are Vaisnava symptoms. There is no question of rejection or dejection. I am always at your service, and you can question whenever there is any doubt, and I will try to answer them as far as possible.

Regarding the printing of my different letters, if you have sufficient time you can work on this project, but I think you have got greater project before you; sales organization of our books and publications. Unless we have got very good organization for selling our books, printing our books any place will be impractical. So I think you will try seriously how to appoint selling agents all over the country. Nay; all over the world. I'll be glad also to hear from you about how you are going to organize this selling propaganda. As for printing of the books, I have already answered this in the letter to Brahmananda, and you can see it.

Hope this will find you in good health and cheerfulness. I am awaiting your early reply.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am always expecting big checks from you for my books. Do you think that you require some money for improving your business? ACB
