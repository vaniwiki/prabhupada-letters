My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7 March, 1970. I am so much obliged to you for the fine sentiment you have expressed in connection with my humble service; but this is not very extraordinary---every human being, for his own interest, should accept a Spiritual Master and abide by His order. This is the Vedic system, and whatever we are trying to do, it is in pursuance of the old order.

Anyway, somehow or other, we are now combined to execute the great will of Lord Caitanya that we should propagate this Krsna consciousness movement through out the whole world. By Krsna’s grace you have gone to Australia with this mission, and I am pleased to learn about the arrangement which you have already made. Here also, in the States, Kirtanananda Maharaj is getting good response from the student circle. In two important colleges our TLC has been taken as study course, and two other colleges have purchased lots of books for their students.

Actually this is a fact, that the books and literatures which we are presenting, are unparalleled at least in the Western countries. So if you can convince the parties concerned, you can also introduce our books and literatures for study in the university circle. So I am awaiting your report of the University meeting. Your sincerity of purpose will itself help you more and more because the Lord is sitting within your heart and as soon as he sees that you require to do something for His service, He will immediately give you all facilities.

For being legally organized, I think if you open a branch of the ISKCON Ltd., incorporated in England, it will be easier for you. Australia is a Commonwealth property, therefore an organization already registered in England can open its branch in its dominion without any difficulty. You can simply take the registered number and date from Mukunda and get it noted by the Registrar in Sydney, and it will be alright.

I talked with Gargamuni about dispatching Upendra’s wife as early as possible. For the present, he is collecting all money for payment of the church property, $50,000 to be paid on or before 1st April 1970. He says that to send Upendra’s wife means another $1000 at least. It is understood that Upendra was to send back $1500. He has taken $2000; out of that $500 would go for his travelling expenses. It was so arranged that as soon as he reached Sydney, he would send back $1500 out of $2000. Now I understand that he has sent you a wire for returning back the money because it is required in connection of purchasing the church.

I therefore ask you to send the money without delay, and after the transaction with the church property is closed, Upendra’s wife to go there. The thing is that he has already given $2000, and again he has to pay another $1000; then the business here will suffer. But it was so arranged that Upendra was to return back $1500. Why he is delaying the matter?

I am glad to know that the boy, Noel, is helping us in so many ways. This is also Krsna’s grace.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
