My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter that you say "I am now prepared to give up all self-created designations and work only as your servant." That is the real position; transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna. That is our real identification. All other identifications are false or temporary. Lord Caitanya said that "I am the servant of the servant of the servant 100 times removed" and similarly we should think ourselves as the servant of the servant of the servant and this attitude will lead to success in Krishna Consciousness [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|(Cc. Madhya 13.80)]].

If we can acquire that Hamilton building, it will be a great credit to you and to our Krishna Consciousness Movement in India. People are expecting something from the American Vaisnavas and so we should make every effort to serve them with a nice place so that they may come and sit down with us and chant Hare Krishna and become Krishna Conscious, as Lord Caitanya desire. Here in Bombay we have already made over thirty life members. Every day we are receiving checks from influential men and the preaching work is going on with great success. So try for that house and we will see what Krishna desires.

Hope you are all well and jolly in Krishna's service.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. If there is inconvenience, you may all come to Bombay. Your friend Jariwala has invited us to go to Surat in full strength. You may all go there directly or come to Bombay and we shall go together.

We are seriously trying to purchase a nice house here, so if possible send all collections (including the promised 25,000/-)in favor of International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Before coming here please ship the deities to U.S.A as it was arranged and see Mr. Trivedi of Scindia Steam Navigation in this connection.
