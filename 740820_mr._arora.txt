My dear Mr. Arora,

Please accept my best wishes. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated. I thank you for your very nice sentiments. I appreciate the affection that you have for our movement. Please continue to go to the temple and upon recommendation from the president, we shall see about initiation.

I shall be glad to see you either here in India or when I return to the West and we can talk further.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
