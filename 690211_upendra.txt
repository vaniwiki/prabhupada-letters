My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 4 February, 1969, and I have noted all of the contents. I thank you very much for the humble sentiments which you have expressed, and I am sure that Lord Nityananda is seeing your sincerity and will be pleased to bless you. Regarding your coming to see me in Los Angeles, you may do this as soon as possible, because I am expecting to be leaving there by the beginning of March. So I will be expecting to see you very soon.

Regarding your idea of having the Los Angeles Samkirtan party come to Seattle and Vancouver, this idea is all right, and when you come here you may talk with Tamal Krishna about this possibility.

Please convey my blessings to the others at your temple. I hope this will meet all of you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
