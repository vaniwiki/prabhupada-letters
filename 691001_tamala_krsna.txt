====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated September 21st and 24th, 1969. Regarding your plan for the house in Beverly Hills, it is all right, but how can you expect $25 per week from all the centers? I already asked them for $15 per month for maintenance fund, but they are not sending regularly. Mostly they are not sending at all. So money depending on others is no money and education depending on books is no education. The cash down price can be arranged somehow or other, but how to meet the monthly expenditures? If it is too straining, I don't think it is advisable to take up the risk. Of course, we must take risk for Krishna, but not to the extent it may hamper our Krishna Consciousness temperament. We can take a risk as long as it can be managed easily.

I am very encouraged to learn that Laguna Beach is doing nicely. Similarly, I am getting good reports from Berkeley. But I have not as yet received any letter from Tokyo. Have they secured any place for starting temple? Regarding your proposed center in Santa Barbara, it is nice. If a California center is favorable, we should first open there. Regarding the photographs of the pictures I have asked you to take, yes, these should be of very fine quality for being published in our __Nectar of Devotion__ and __Krishna__ book. So far as the size is concerned, this you must consult with Brahmananda, because he is in charge of setting up the books. The picture by Devahuti which was in my room will be printed on the cover of __Nectar of Devotion,__ so Brahmananda must decide if this picture will cover the entire front cover, with the title printed on top of it, or if there will be some space allowed for the title on an upper margin, as was done in __TLC.__ You may keep the photographs there in LA, and some of them may be published in __BTG__ on the cover. Relationship between Godbrothers must be very genuine and pleasing. Otherwise, the future of our institution will not be very hopeful. After all, very soon you have to manage. As I am getting old, I wish to retire from an active part. Of course, I shall be behind the scene, but I am thinking of writing a constitutional will on my return from Europe. Enclosed please find the proclamation you have requested. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
