My dear Ramesvara;

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find one book written by Harikesa Prabhu called, Spiritual Dialectism. Please first of all print it in Back to Godhead magazine and if the response is good it maybe made into a book along the lines of Svarupa Damodaras book, The Scientific Basis of Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
