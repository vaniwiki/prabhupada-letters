My dear Gaura Govinda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 15/11/75 and have noted the contents. So if you think your presence is required in Bhuvaneśvara, then you can go there for necessary action. I am going to Vrndavana, so you can come and meet me at Vrndavana and from there you can go to Bhuvaneśvara.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
