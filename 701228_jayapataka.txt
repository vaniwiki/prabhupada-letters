Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I hope everything is going on with good prospect in Calcutta. I have decided to come there for the meeting with Mrs. Birla at the Birla Academy on the 6th January, 1971.

Our program here in Surat is very successful and we are terminating it for the time being when we depart for Bombay on the 2nd January. From Bombay we are catching the 1 down (via Nagpur) Howrah Mail Train leaving on the 3rd at 6.45 PM and reaching Calcutta on the 5th at 8.25 AM. So I will be glad to see you there if you can arrange a nice reception. We shall be coming either two men or four.

In the meantime the rest of our party is going to Allahabad for establishing our Magh Mela Camp.

Hope this will meet you in good health

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
