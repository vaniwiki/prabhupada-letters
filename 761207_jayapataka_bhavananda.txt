My dear Jayapataka and Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 3, 1976.

Yes, I sanction your getting the necessary funds from the MVT (1 1/2 lakhs). One thing is, you say you have received $10,000 from Gurukrpa for a generator. However, that should not cost more than $6,000. The balance can be utilized in the building scheme.

The boat party must continue preaching. It is very nicely responded to. The educated men you have mentioned, who have joined us must be kept very satisfied. These men are required. You say that everyone is working without any caste or race consideration. That is required. That is the basic standard of Krsna Consciousness.

Regarding Sri Jaya Narayana das Babaji, don't allow him any more. He has gone out without telling, that's alright.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
