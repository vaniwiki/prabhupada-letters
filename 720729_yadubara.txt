My dear Yadubara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 19, 1972, and have noted the contents. Yes, that is nice, you may continue to photograph all of the manuscripts of Bhaktivinode Thakura and other great acaryas in our Vaisnava line, but for now do not photograph anything of Lalita Prasad's manuscripts. When I go there I shall see. First of all let us see Bhaktivinode Thakura's works, then we shall see further.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
