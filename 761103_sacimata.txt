My dear Sacimata,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 26/10/76.

You may send the money (1.000 DM) that you have offered to my account here in the name of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. The name of the bank is Punjab National Bank, Krishna Balarama Branch, account #1. Thank you very much.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
