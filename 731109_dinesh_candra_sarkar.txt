My dear Dinesh Candra Sarkar:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21/10/73 in Bengali and have noted the contents with thanks. At present I am in Delhi. I left Bombay on the 1st after finishing the land dispute there and shall return to Bombay again on my way to Nairobi by the 23rd instant. Then I shall return back to USA via Rome and shall come back to India in the month of March during Lord Caitanya's Appearance Day.

For the time being I am keeping my health fairly well. Certainly I was sick when I left Calcutta for London, but I improved my health there. So after all, this is an old body. I am 78 years, and still by the grace of Krsna it is going on. So I am very much thankful for your enquiry about my health.

I am glad that sometimes you are going to the temple, and are staying to take prasadam. So when I shall return there we can talk more.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
