My dear Candanacarya Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 15, 1974 and have noted the contents. You, and the others who have signed your proposal, should know that the BBT advanced to Spiritual Sky money without my consent. Now Spiritual Sky cannot return the money to BBT. What is the answer of Karandhara to this implication? Before becoming returned in his BBT position, he must answer this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
