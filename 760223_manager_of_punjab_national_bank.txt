The Manager\\
Punjab National Bank\\
Vrndaban

Dear Sri Manager Sahab,

REG.: The opening of your bank's office at the Krishna-Balarama Mandir, Raman Reti, Vrindaban, U.P.

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your both letters dated 7th and 14th February, 1976. I am very glad to know you have gotten sanction for the branch office at our Krishna-Balarama Temple. I thank you very much for your appreciation. So far as going to Vrindaban, I am engaged here until 17th March. Therefore the earliest that I can reach there by the 18th to 20th March, 1976, if you think you can wait up to that date. But if your order is to open immediately, I have no objection. I have all my blessings upon you all and you can do that. In case you open the branch earlier then let me know the exact date. On or before that time I shall dispatch five (5) laks of rupees as desired by you. But if you think you can wait until my arrival by the 18th to 20th March, then I shall personally deposit the money on that date while opening the ceremony.

Thanking you.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
