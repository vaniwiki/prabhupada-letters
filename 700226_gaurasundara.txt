My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24 February, 1970, together with your air flight ticket. So far Devananda is concerned, he must accompany me. Two Brahmacaris, Devananda and Nanda Kumar, are attending me 24 hours in so many ways, so if I go to Hawaii at least one of them must go with me.

Another thing has developed in the meantime, that we have made contract to purchase a nice church here, costing $225,000; and the down payment has to be made $50,000 within the month of March. So there is a great strain to collect this $50,000 from many sources including from my book fund. Therefore, even if I go to Hawaii, I will have to come back within a week because in my absence the transaction for purchasing the house may suffer.

Under the circumstances, why don't you postpone for a future date when the mango season will be current. I do not think it is advisable in this stage to spend about $300 for a short period for our going and coming back. So I hope you will consider the present situation and let me know what is your decision.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
