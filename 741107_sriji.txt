My dear Sriji devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your Vyasa Puja offering dated August 22, 1974, received just now and I am very glad to receive it; better late than never. I thank you very much for your sentiments. Satisfaction of the spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his sincere disciple. We cannot manufacture our own process, therefore mental speculation does not at all help us in spiritual life. One simply has to surrender himself to his guru and everything will be revealed to him.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
