My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 11th February and 26th March, 1971, respectively and have noted the contents carefully. That there have been no newly initiated devotees from Japan is all right. It doesn't matter whether they are initiated or not. If they are coming in large number, that is the success of our mission. We are not after making initiated members very many but our concern is that people understand this philosophy in wider circles. Initiated members are for managing the temples and preaching work, but our program is to invite people to our feasts, let them hear our philosophy and dance and chant. That is the basic principle of our philosophy in preaching work.

So far as raising money for going there, I have already given Bhanu $280.00. He had this for passage fee deposited in my book account and now I have returned it.

Do not worry about the immigration difficulties. It will all be done by Krishna's grace. Don't worry. Take to the right process and it will be done. I am writing one letter to the Tokyo Immigration office, as to your request and a copy of that letter is enclosed herewith. It is very encouraging to me that you are so determined not to leave Japan, and this will help you for supplying advancement in Krishna Consciousness. And as soon as this situation is settled up, you can call back Cintamani and Satyavrata also.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
