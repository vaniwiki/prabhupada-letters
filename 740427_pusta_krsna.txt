Dear Pusta Krsna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of April 21, 1974 and I have noted the contents.

Yes, I think the advise given by Brahmananda Maharaja is sound, namely not to worry about maintaining a permanent center in South Africa but travelling with sankirtana there for distributing books and preaching, which you say is a good field there. We do not have so many men; it requires at least five men to maintain a center, so I approve of your plan to close the center and travel in South Africa.

As for the deities of Gaura-Nitai, yes you may take them on travelling sankirtana and worship them. Please keep me informed of your activities.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
