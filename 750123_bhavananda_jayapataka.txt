Mayapur

My dear Bhavananda Svami and Jayapataka Svami,

Please accept my blessings. The bearer of this letter, Jagannatha das brahmacari is coming to Mayapur to work on the Caitanya Caritamrta manuscript. Hopefully, he will finish editing work on the Antya-lila by the Festival at the end of March. Please give him all facilities in this connection. He will need a quiet spot for working. Try to see that he is full-time engaged in this editing work.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
