My Dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated November 3, 1969, and it is so much heart-engladdening that you have taken very seriously the preaching work, and Krishna is giving you chance for becoming a great preacher in the near future. Yes, from the very beginning of your sannyas I had the desire like this, so Krishna is now fulfilling my desire. Be blessed and go on with your work. New Vrindaban is also improving and I am pleased that you have solved the important question of water supply. This was a great problem, and now that you are fitting the pump to work it is very nice.

Regarding distribution of books, if you kindly take up the charge of introducing our books in the colleges and universities, then any of our publications may be immediately distributed at least 10,000 copies all over your country. There are so many colleges and college libraries, and you are the person to take charge of this task. Of course, It will take some time, but if you make the plan and stick to this work that will be very nice. For this purpose whatever help you want, please let me know and I must help you in this effort. Any scholarly pamphlet you want in this connection, you make a draft and send to me for arranging its being printed in our press. Also please let me know how many thousand copies you will have need for. You are educated, intelligent and experienced by this time, and you shall be the fit person to take up this job and do the needful.

Please offer my blessings to Yamunacharya and the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
