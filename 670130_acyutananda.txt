My dear Acyutananda,

Please accept my blessings. Since Kirtanananda is absent certainly you are feeling some strain. But the more you serve Krishna the more you become stronger. I hope you are being properly assisted by your other Godbrothers. I shall be glad to hear from you. May Krishna give you all protection in the discharge of your transcendental duties.

Yours ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
