My dear Jagadisa das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the difficulty with Gurukula what can I reply? This is your responsibility. The GBC can decide what to do. Instead of spending money there, if the government is specifically passing the act against us, then we can spend that money in the Gurukula in Vrindaban. We are getting land adjacent to our temple and on Radhastami I laid the foundation stone for a Gurukula. We shall put up a suitable building there. In India there is no such government regulative law.

I see that all the temple presidents are not to your liking. So how will you manage? If all the presidents are bad and not to your liking, then let the GBC consider what to do.

I hope this meets you in good health. You say that Karandhara was being supported by Jayatirtha, but Karandhara does he have any position still? He has no official position I do not think.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
