My dear Rayarama,

please accept my blessings. My first concern is that you are not eating well. It is a case of anxiety. Please don't eat dal and spices. Simply boiled vegetables, rice and a few capatis. Take butter separately and eat only as much as you may require for taste. Drink milk twice, morning and evening. Don't eat at night. Eat some fruits in the evening. Use some digestive pill after each principle meal. I think soda-mint tablets will help. Be careful about your health first. This information is not only for you but all my noble sons. I am an old man. I may live or die it does not matter. But you must live for long time to push on this Krishna Consciousness movement.

I hope you have received all my letters and the purports of Gita which I sent you from Calcutta.

I am anxious to know about Damodara. What happens to him. If he is in need of sex, who forbids him. A man in sex life is not neglected by us. The only thing we want, that sex life can be allowed only in married couples. So get him convinced about it. What is the reason that he wants to leave us? It is understood that the finished MSS. of the Teachings of Lord Caitanya is with him; whether he has delivered this final MSS. to Brahmananda for printing purpose? __Please inform me about this.__ Too much editing is not required. If Satsvarupa has already edited it, there is no need of further editing. Please send me the address of Dvarakadhisa. He had some correspondence with __DP__ Dai Nippon Printing Co. of Japan. If possible we may get the TLC printed from Japan or in Holland as you informed me, at chapter rate. Please talk with your Godbrothers and let me know about it.

So far my health is concerned, you know that it is a broken old house. You cannot expect as good as you are doing. So my future hope is you all good spiritual sons. Still I am taking as much care as possible. My only desire is that you all good boys may take up the matter very seriously. __I am very sorry for Hayagriva and Kirtanananda who have left me when I need them very much. Krishna may give them good sense and let them come back to work with me.__

Hope you are well. Offer my blessings to Brahmananda and others. Please send me the third Canto English translation of the Srimad-Bhagavatam done by the Gita Press. You got these copies from the Gita Press for reference. I want the third canto, please send as soon as possible. Thanking you once more,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
