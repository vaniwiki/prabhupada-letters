My dear Lokamangala das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 30, 1975 and have noted the contents. You have asked me what I feel is the best engagement for you at this time and in response, I kindly request you to continue to distribute my books full-time. You are very expert in this matter and you can also teach others how to do it. At the present moment, the plays are not as important as our book distribution. So, my desire is that you increase your book distribution more and more and be blessed by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
