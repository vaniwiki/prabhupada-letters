My dear Madan Mohan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 26, 1969, and I am so much pleased to learn that you are gradually improving your Krishna Consciousness. The secret of success in Krishna Consciousness is to render service to Krishna to the best of our capacity. There is no other alternative to this. The more we render service therefore, the more we are able to advance. You have taken the work of indexing, so you may continue to do this. And if you want to remain, it doesn't matter, but your full energy should be engaged in the Lord's service. That is the secret of success. I do not know if Hayagriva is doing the indexing work, but I have heard from Rayarama that you have advanced considerably in this connection, so do it nicely.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
