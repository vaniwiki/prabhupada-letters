My dear Krsna dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 9th and 26th March, 1971 respectively and they are most encouraging. You have taken the matter very intelligently and now we have got invitation from one Professor G. G. Kotovsky in Moscow. So I agree to go to Germany as soon as I hear from you in reply to this letter. Please let me know the following points.

1) How many of us will go to Russia?

2) Whether we shall go in a party or simply we shall go 2 or 3 persons on the meeting days and come back again to Germany, as you write to say that it takes only two hours. So there will be no difficulty to go to Moscow or any other city and come back again. But if we get some place to stay there for a week or a fortnight, that will be nice.

3) What about visas?

4) If we go some day and come back as I did when I was in London; we all went to Amsterdam and came back the same evening.

So we are now in Bombay and you can reply these points immediately and if you so desire, we can start immediately or as you direct. Amongst us, Syamasundara knows German language. So if you think that his presence will facilitate, then he can also go. So on the whole, you make all arrangements for going there as it is convenient. Arrange for visas and on hearing from you I shall start.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
