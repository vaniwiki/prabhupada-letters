My dear Aksojananda Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10/12/74, and upon your recommendation I am accepting for twice born brahminical initiation Sriman Muktananda das Brahmacari. Enclosed is his sacred thread duly sanctified and his mantra sheet. Now hold a fire sacrifice, and let him hear the mantra through the right ear, and impress upon him that he is taking vows before Radha and Krishna, the spiritual master and the Vaisnavas.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
