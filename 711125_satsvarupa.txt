My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of November 17, 1971, and I am especially pleased that the church owners in Dallas have accepted our offer of $26,000 down payment. I have seen one copy of the contract sent to me by Karandhara. It seems all right. One thing: What are the monthly payments? Now you organize our KC school very nicely on the basis of a kindergarten school and primary school for children up to 15 years old. That is a good proposal, that parents should not accompany their children. Actually that is the gurukula system. The children should take complete protection of the Spiritual Master, and serve him and learn from him nicely. Just see how nicely your brahmacaris are working. They will go out in early morning and beg all day on the order of the guru. At night they will come home with a little rice and sleep without cover on the floor. And they think this work is very pleasant. If they are not spoiled by an artificial standard of sense gratification at an early age, children will turn out very nicely as sober citizens, because they have learned the real meaning of life. If they are trained to accept that austerity is very enjoyable then they will not be spoiled. So you organize everything in such a way that we can deliver these souls back to Krishna---this is our real work. Some of our girls may be trained in colleges and take teacher exams, and their husbands also. As you develop our program there I shall give you more hints.

As for the extra room, that may be utilized in future as classrooms as our school program expands. But for the time being why not open a hostel for the hippies? I want that all the hippies should come to me and I shall solve their problems. Actually all these hippies should join us. I am seeing that in this Delhi city many hippies from your country are coming, but they are simply hungry and dirty and being cheated. During our pandal program some of them came to me and became my disciples. So we must look out for them and take interest that they should be delivered from this miserable condition. They are our best customers. If we give them place to sleep comfortably and nice prasadam, and if they agree to follow the four rules and attend our aratis and classes, why not invite the hippies to live with us? Gradually they will become devotees. The American Ambassador to India, Mr. Kenneth Keating, is very much in favor of our Movement, especially on this point of giving you people the right advice and saving them from intoxication and being hippies. If your government would give us some help I can save all of them. That would be a great blessing for your country. Otherwise this hippie class will simply spoil everything they have worked so hard for.

You will be pleased to note that I am taking a party of devotees to Vrindaban tomorrow for __parikrama.__ We shall remain there for a few days,
