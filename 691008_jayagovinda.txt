My dear Jaya Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge reciept of your letter dated October 3rd, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased to note that you are so seriously considering how to organize the printing of our German Krishna Consciousness literature. You have suggested that you print in __ZZG__ simply the verses of __Bhagavad-gita,__ but without the purport what is the meaning of the verses? The purport is actually the main thing. So you can pick up the principal point of a purport and make then a heading for the article. Just like in the next issue Satsvarupa has published an article, "Lord Siva, the Greatest Devotee". This was picked up from my translation and purport of 3rd Canto __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ So far as sales are concerned, if you don't sell, then how you will be able to maintain your establishment? If you want to maintain a nice place simply by all working hard---in the beginning that is all right---but if you cannot maintain it by selling literature and making collections, then that is not a good idea. How to sell our magazines and literatures you have to find out means and ways. On the whole, everywhere we are arranging to sell our __BTG__ and maintaining our centers on this sale. So what is the defect that you cannot sell? It is printed in the German language, and it is presenting new and sublime ideas. I you wish, you can cut down on the production costs as you have described, but the sales must be there. Another thing is that you should obtain this IBM machine as you have mentioned. Then you can make the size of __ZZG__ suitable for being printed later on in our Boston presses in book size. If the composition is prepared by this time, we can immediately print in Boston on our own press which will be ready in December. In that case __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ may be translated and printed in __ZZG__ in a book shape, so later on it can be reprinted in book form. That is a good idea, but it means you will have to reduce the size of the pages of the magazine. Regarding Kulasekhara, I have asked him to go and join you. Most probably he will join you very soon.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
