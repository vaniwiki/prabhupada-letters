My dear Nityananda Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1 March, 1970, along with your beads and request to become my initiated disciple. I am glad to learn that you are already progressing nicely in Krsna Consciousness and actively engaged in leading Sankirtana Party at Buffalo Temple.

So I am very happy to accept you as my bona fide initiated disciple, and your spiritual name is Nityananda Das. One who is desiring to have the eternal bliss of association of Lord Krsna by devotional service must be the sincere servant of Nityananda Prabhu, and in that way win His grace. Therefore your name is Nityananda Das, servant of Lord Nityananda. I have chanted your beads duly, and they are returned herewith. I am also enclosing one sheet of standard practices for devotees, for your reference.

Please follow the regulative principles strictly, and chant daily sixteen rounds of beads regularly without fail. This is the essential process for dissolving the clouds of illusion or Maya; and when the cloud of illusion is removed, then we can understand Krsna Consciousness perfectly and that is the highest perfection of human life. So be fixed in devotional service, chant Hare Krsna mantra and be happy. I am waiting to hear of your further progress in spreading this Krsna Consciousness movement for the benefit of all concerned.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
