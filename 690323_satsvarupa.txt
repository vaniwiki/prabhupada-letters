My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter. I am very much pleased to note the list of engagements you have submitted, and I can see you have been working very hard to secure so many opportunities for spreading K.C. Yes, within those days stated in your letter of March 20th you can add more engagements as you like. I have no objection. I have not yet received word from Rupanuga, in this connection, but you can plan on your program as it is set up. In N.Y. we have got engagement and they are paying $100 for a meeting, so you try to settle fees not less than $50 per lecture. So you can engage the whole duration of my stay there, and I shall deliver every day one lecture.

Regarding Jadurani's coming here, Govinda and Gaurasundara will consult with you, and when things are duly set up, she may come here for some time. They will write you in this connection.

I hope you are well, and that Jadurani is resting nicely; I am hoping she will soon be recovered and be able to again feel in good health, so let us see.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
