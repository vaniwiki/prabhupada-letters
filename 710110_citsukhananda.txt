My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10th, December, 1970, and noted the contents. I beg to thank you for your nice appreciations of this transcendental movement which I have been trying to present to you on request of my Guru Maharaja. Now I am counting on your good self and all my other good disciples to kindly take this message very seriously and make your lives sublime and the lives of all you contact similarly sublime. That is our business---to please the transcendental Lord by disseminating His message of Krsna consciousness or Love of God by the simple method of Sankirtana.

I am so glad to know that our San Francisco Temple is improving at the new location. Regarding the arrangement for an altar, you may follow the arrangements made in L.A.---that is just suitable---and when the Radha Krsna Murtis arrive from India everything will be complete.

Please continue your program in the universities. They are the best places for propagation of our philosophy and the students are very eager for this crucial information. They are not unaware of the futility of material education which gives a paper degree only, because it is common observation that the graduates are unable to find good employment and the students are becoming hippies, etc. So they are wanting something good and that best thing is Krsna consciousness.

I am glad that you are finding the work of the GBC to be very nice. That is required. Everything should be done in a spirit of cooperation and Krsna's work will go on unhampered. That is our only desire. It is very good that you have begun to spread Krsna consciousness literatures in Spanish language and that was your proposal since a long time, so do it. We are requiring all our energies to be channelled in the service of Krsna and then only will our mission be complete and our life perfected.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
