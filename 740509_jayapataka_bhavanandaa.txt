Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka and Bhavananda Maharajas,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28, April, 1974.

You write that you are very careful utilizing funds that are sent for that particular purpose. In all matters of management this careful attitude must be taken. I have been requesting my disciples for sometime to release me from the management aspects of ISKCON so I can be free to translate. And you two are managing one of our biggest centers. I cannot close my eyes when there are big management difficulties, so when I see things going wrong, money mispent, things not used properly, then I have to take part. But if you can relieve me of worry of management in Mayapur it will be a great relief for me. Krsna will give you more and more intelligence on how to do this if you sincerely endeavor.

Up to 5,000 to 10,000 rupees for purchasing land there is always available from the Mayapur-Vrindaban Trust fund. You write that you now have Rs. 9000/ so another 10,000/ will be made available to you for this purpose.

As for the hand-tiller from Japan that you are using on a trial basis, you should ask Bali Mardan to supply you this Japanese machine. He has good connections in Japan. He can provide you that same Japanese motor hand-tiller much cheaper or even free.

The news that you are able to keep up the prasadam program which is now up to 1500 persons on Sunday is very welcome and I hope you can continue this without stoppage. The success of Bhavananda Maharaja's English lessons of the Varnasrama College has given me great pleasure and I am sure many devotees will come from this program. It is a first class idea.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
