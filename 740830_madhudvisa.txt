My dear Madhudvisa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 14, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding the convent, they have put an awkward condition that the chapel must be demolished. Never before has this been done. Indirectly they have denied to sell to us. Never mind. Find out another property. That ten men have just joined us is our real success.

Yes, you can use the book sales money and repay as you have proposed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Take help from Rev. Powell %%___%% that and the Bishops of Melbourne. The proposal is %%___%% and they can rectify it.\\
