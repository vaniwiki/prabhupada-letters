Dear Mr. Sarkar:

Please accept my best wishes. Your letter dated October 17, 1974 has been received, and I may inform you that Srila Prabhupad is expected to be on Calcutta on Wednesday, October 30, 1974 for one day only. So you are welcome to come and see him after 5:00 P.M. I suggest that you confirm these plans with the Calcutta temple, 3 Albert Road, before coming.

I hope this meets you in better health.

Faithfully yours,

Brahmananda Swami
