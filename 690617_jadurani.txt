====== Letter to: Jadurani ======

My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you so much for your encouraging letter, and I am so pleased to learn that the center is doing very nice propaganda work in Hawaii. Now you send to Brahmananda as many photographs as possible of the parading and the other chanting engagements. It will be the policy of our paper now to print as many as possible photos and articles of our own activities. I understand from Gaurasundara's letter that there is now inconvenience in having so many people living in the house there, so I think you may immediately return to Satsvarupa in Boston. I think that you may now take part in Sankirtana activities, so when you return to Boston you may go out with them sometimes on Sankirtana Party. I am very glad to know that Govinda Dasi felt herself cured of all her diseases by hearing my words, and I am very much encouraged. Both of you chant Hare Krishna and join Sankirtana Party, and there will be no disease. Maharaja Pariksit said that chanting the glories of the Lord can be executed by liberated persons. This means by chanting one becomes liberated from all material impediments. Not only chanting gives us liberation, but even in our conditioned state we like to hear the sweet melodious sound of the chanting. Only a person who is committing suicide or who is addicted in animal killing, such persons cannot relish the sweetness of this chanting. But even if they take to this chanting, they will become liberated.

Thank you again for your letter. I am enclosing a list of the special Krishna Consciousness holidays in the coming months. I hope this will meet you in improved health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
