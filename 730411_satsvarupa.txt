My dear Satsvarupa Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 8, 1973. Now I am concerned that the Gurukula experiment should come out nicely. These children are the future hope of our Society, so it is a very important matter how we are training them in Krishna consciousness from the very childhood. It was yourself who started this idea and it has been progressing nicely. Now you see that it continues to develop. So you should go there and inform me what is the position.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. The simple method I have introduced, namely learn English and Sanskrit, is sufficient. Why the so-called Montessori method? (P.S. handwritten)
