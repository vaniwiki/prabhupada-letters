My dear Acyutananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 18, 1972, and I have noted the contents. One thing is, Sriman Lalita Prasad Thakura has not fulfilled his promise to give us that place in Birnagar for our ISKCON Temple. So I don't want you to mix with him further. I have just got one letter from Acarya das, wherein he requests to live with Lalita Prasad Thakura for taking instruction from him. I do not like this idea, I don't know where these ideas are coming from. No one should go there any more. Let Yadubara take his photos as he has taken so much trouble and they may be valuable for the future, but besides Yadubara no one else should go there, and Acarya das should not go there either.

Regarding your going to Vrindaban to assist Gurudasa, yes, if you like you can go. I have no objection. One thing is, I have got many tapes of my speaking in Bengali language, and if you and Satchidananda can co-operatively transcribe them for printing there? I do not want to send them to you unless I have got assurance from you that they will be done under your supervision. But if you are going to Vrindaban that will be a good opportunity to sit down and transcribe my Bengali tapes because there is Bengali typewriter in Vrindaban. You may also translate other things as you have mentioned, that is nice.

I have received the tapes but have not had time to hear them yet, but I have not received the song books, they may be in New York.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
