====== Letter to: Govardhana ======

Detroit

My dear Govardhana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 7, 1975. It is a very good achievement that you have gotten this new building in Detroit. It is very aristocratic and prestigious. Do everything very nicely there now. You now have very good facility for broadcasting our Krsna consciousness propaganda. Just do everything very carefully and soberly. As soon as everything is set up, I will go there. You can call the new Detroit temple Devasadhan, meaning celestial.

Upon your recommendation, I accept as twice-born initiated brahmanas Ramananda Raya das and Visvatomukha das. Enclosed are their brahminical threads, duly sanctified and the mantra sheet. Hold a fire sacrifice and impress upon them the importance of following the rules and regulations so that they may not be affected by the influence of maya. There is two things: there's Krsna and there's sex life. So if you want to have Krsna, one must be above illicit sex life. That requires some strength. So you have to impress upon them that following these rules and regulations, especially by chanting Hare Krsna, one will become strong. Unfortunately, we have no taste for this chanting. This is our misfortune.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
