My dear sons and daughters,

Please accept my blessings. I am very grateful for all your offerings of daksina to your spiritual master. This is the system. Now all of you must very sincerely follow the regulative principles. Four don'ts and one do: No illicit sex-life, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat-eating . . . and always chanting Hare Krishna, minimum 16 rounds daily. If you take very seriously these principles then Krishna will bless you without any doubt.

I hope that this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
