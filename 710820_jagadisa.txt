My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. You happen to be a member of the GBC. So whatever you want to do or whatever ideas you want to introduce in the management of our society, please write in a letter and distribute the copies to all the GBC members along with one copy to me also. Then collect the opinions of each and every GBC member and if the majority supports the idea then it should be taken as a fact for being carried out in our society. The majority vote and my opinion should be taken. When the majority opinion is present, my opinion will be yes or no. In most cases it will be yes unless it is grievously against our principles.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have just now received your letter dated 17th August and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear how nicely things are going on there and that new temples are being proposed also. Very good. Do it enthusiastically and with determination and Krishna will give you all facility.

Soon I may be returning to N.Y. but it hasn't been fixed up yet. If I do, then certainly I will visit Toronto. ACB\\
