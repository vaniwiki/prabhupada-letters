New Delhi

My dear Tejiyas,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Delhi dated 2 August, 1972 and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. I am very glad to hear that we shall be holding another Hare Krishna Festival in Delhi this year, and I am hoping that I shall also be able to attend as before. That LIC grounds is no longer available, but we must find another suitable location within the city center of New Delhi,* as close to Connaught Circus as possible. That will be very nice. So you and your good wife kindly give Gurudasa all assistance for organizing the festival, and I shall also come if I am able.

Your program for preaching in Delhi is very much approved by me, preaching Krsna is the same as remembering Krsna. I can understand if one of my students is making spiritual advancement if he is also making many life members and devotees. So you have not to minimize the preaching program in order to study independently, no, continue as you are doing, preach as much as possible, collect, make life members, and whenever you have time read and study and never neglect to chant your sixteen rounds daily, and this will be the perfect program.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
