My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to receive your letter dated November 3, 1972, that your programme there is improving considerably every week. That is very good news. Yes, I think you have improved the situation there, and you are better manager than Brahmananda. I am especially happy to hear that you are making some local African boys and girls into devotees, that I wanted. Preaching is our real business, not getting big, big buildings and doing business for money just to maintain them, no. We shall live under a tree, that is not difficult, but we must go on preaching every moment, that will make us happy. So i am glad to see also your quiz-test for the African boys, and also your Swahili-language BTG, these are good evidence of your improvement.

Yes, if there are African girls also who want to join us, and if they get the consent of their elder family members to live with us, they may live in the temple provided there is separate place for them so that boys and girls will not mix freely, just as we are doing everywhere. If that boy wants to marry your African girl, I have no objection as long as she obtains the permission of her parents and elders, and provided they live separately in the temple, or if they live together, they must live outside. Mr. Shah has sent me one letter of complaint in financial matters, so I have forwarded it to Brahmananda. Now you together deal with these money matters and Mr. Shah, should I always have to be consulted in these things? Enclosed find the copy of amendment, duly signed.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
