Dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 4, 1974, and I have noted the contents.

I am glad to hear that the Calcutta temple is progressing nicely under your direction, that devotees are going out daily distributing books and collecting. As far as my meeting with the indutrialist G.D. Kothari and others to discuss building a Calcutta temple, my present schedule is that I am remaining in India until May 15, and then going to Pairs, France. On April 18 I am going to Hyderabad for a week and from there spend a week in South India traveling. So after that, if such a meeting can be arranged before I leave? Otherwise, when I return to India at the end of July I can meet.

Regarding your complaint that Jayapataka Swami does not give you account of the money you send there, please try to rectify this amongst yourselves. I have sent Brahmananda Swami your elder brother, to Mayapur just to help organize their management. Now among yourselves you are all senior members, rectify this rift between Calcutta and Mayapur. Your idea to send Mayapur Rs 6,800.00 monthly for construction costs only, and let them make up that same amount monthly which is their maintenance money, is a good plan. I have heard there is good chance for life membership in Nadia area, and Panca Dravida Maharaja can train up others how to do it. You all must push on cooperatively and spare me from too much management intervention; that will be your success.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I want to organize a women kirtana party singing the Gita Gan. Can you help me?
