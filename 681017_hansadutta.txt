My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find one copy of the letter which I have sent yesterday to the Consulate General of the United States of America, at Montreal, sent by special delivery air mail, so that they may keep the file there as I am going to meet them on the appointment day as they have set up, Oct. 25, 1968. I hope you have already made this arrangement. Hope everything is all right. I am coming there on the 23rd of October, 1968. I am starting from here by 7:15 air flight to Vancouver, and from there I shall catch another plane at 8:30, and reach Montreal sometime in the evening, they say 6:30 Montreal time. So the flight number is No. 04, of Canadian Pacific Airlines---date, Oct. 23, 1968. So, as I am coming there alone, I think Himavati will have to cook for me while I am there.

Hoping you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
