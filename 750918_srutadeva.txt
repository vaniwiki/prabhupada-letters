My dear Srutadeva das,

Please accept my blessings. I was in due receipt of your Sankirtana Newsletter, Volume 2, Number 23. The report from Denver regarding the legal judgment of Judge M. Winner is giving intelligence to the judge also. It appears that the airport officials are defeated. I have heard that in some of the airports they are making announcements telling the people not to purchase our literature. This is impeding our religion and is therefore blasphemy. This cannot be allowed. You should take this to the courts; let people know what they are doing. They cannot impede our right. It is simply wonderful that Carudesna dasa has distributed in one day 210 big books.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
