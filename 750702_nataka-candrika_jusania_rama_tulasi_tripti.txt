My dear daughters,

Please accept my blessings.

I am in due receipt of the nice silver gift box which I already put to my personal use. I thank you very much for your taking seriously to this Krsna Consciousness movement by spreading this movement of Lord Caitanya's here in Denver. I am sure that Lord Caitanya will benedict you, and that this will be a great success for Krsna Consciousness in Denver.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
