My dear Brother Dr. Syama Sundar Prabhu,

Please accept my humble dandabats. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very affectionate letter dated 18th March, 1969. From Los Angeles I went to my Hawaii center, then to San Francisco, and now I am in the New York center. I understand that Jagantar has published about our London activities. In London there are six boys and girls, all my initiated married couples, and though they are young, they are doing very nice work in London. One of them wrote a letter to Srimate Vinode Vani for cooperation, but she replied that she cannot do anything without permission from Bagh Bazar H.O. But I do not know if they wrote any letter to Bagh Bazar.

So far I am concerned, I am always for cooperation, and I don't criticize anybody. I am very busy with my own work. Rather I welcome everyone's cooperation. If you think there is possibility of cooperation you can open negotiation directly with Sripada Audolomi Maharaja. If we cooperate, we can do tremendous service for Lord Caitanya in the matter of propagating the mission of Lord Caitanya very nicely. I am prepared to cooperate in every way, but I wonder if the other side is prepared for this also. I shall be happy to hear from you soon.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
