Vrndavana

My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings,

Just now I have sent you a telegram reading as follows:

"CANNOT ATTEND BY MEDICAL ORDER PROGRAM MAY GO ON BY VRNDAVAN PARTY LETTER FOLLOWS ALSO SENDING MY ZONAL SECRETARY

BHAKTIVEDANTA SWAMI"

My health being not very good, the doctors have advised against making the long train journey as well as the vigorous preaching involved. Under the circumstances I was forced to cancel my going. However you may go as planned along with a few other devotees and hold the pandal program. Kindly let me know what was the response from the villagers during the program. Mr. Dwivedi is very eager for our cooperation, and if there is good response, then I think we can develop a very nice program there. So please give me your report in detail after the function is completed.

Hoping this meet you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
