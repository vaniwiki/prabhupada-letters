My dear Nayana Bhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 11th, 1970, and noted the contents with satisfaction. It is most important if you arrange lectures and kirtanas at the schools and colleges because the more intelligent young boys and girls of your country are very much eager to understand this Krishna Consciousness Movement. They are frustrated in so many ways and they are looking for something new kind of happiness which they will find in this Krsna Consciousness Movement.

Please also try to introduce our books in the colleges and schools as well as local libraries. I have received word from other centers that our literatures are very well received and often they are being used as course textbooks in the schools and colleges. You are already preaching on the university campuses, so you add this book distribution to your program and make it complete with preaching, chanting of Hare Krsna Mahamantra, distribution of Prasadam and literatures. I know how well this program is received by the students because they are very intelligent. You are also very intelligent boy and devotee of Krsna and Krsna will give you even more intelligence in proportion to your endeavor to serve Him faithfully.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, whose picture in the news clipping is showing nice Krsna Consciousness, and all the other devotees there in our Philadelphia Temple.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
