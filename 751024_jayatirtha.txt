My dear jayatirtha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the September BBt Trustees report with enclosed report of Mayapur-Vrindaban Fund, Bank of America account number 6004-07143, for the months of July, August, and September 1975.

I have noted that in July there were so many deposits. Why in August, September there were not so many deposits? Please explain.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S.\\
Jayatirtha as per your request Mohanananda's address\\
Michael Walker, Chandler, 352 W. 15th, New York 10011.
