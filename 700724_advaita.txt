====== Letter to: Advaita ======

Boston

My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated 23rd July, 1970, and the two copies of the Krsna Consciousness Handbook.

It is very nice, although the color pictures are not very clear. But one blunder has been done on page 98 about the London Temple being printed backside so Lord Jagannatha, Lord Krsna, Srimati Radharani, everyone, has changed His position. I do not think there is any possibility of rectifying now, but in future please take special care for this.

There are some discrepancies on the front cover of BTG #34 which I have pointed out to Brahmananda Maharaja. You have not mentioned anything about your other activities in the press.

By the by, please dispatch one copy of this Handbook to the following address by air parcel.\\
Sri P. C. Gandhi\\
c-120, Moti Nagar\\
New Delhi-15\\
India

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
