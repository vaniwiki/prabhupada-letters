====== Letter to: Mr. S. S. Sethi (Vice Consul of India) ======

Sri S. S. Sethi, Vice Consul\\
Consulate General of India\\
215 Market Street\\
San Francisco, Cal.

Dear Mr. Sethi,

Please accept my greetings. I hope by this time you have received two copies of photos I have sent you through Sri Somnath Dhar. Now with reference to your letter no. SANF/CONS/384/68 addressed to Mr. A.C. Misra, Attache, High Commission of India, Ottawa, Canada, I beg to inform you that they have sent me a wrong passport and returned back the postal order in order that I may receive the certificates from your office. In this connection they write to say as follows: "As you are no longer living within our jurisdiction, you are advised to contact our San Francisco office for police clearance and birth certificate." Please therefore issue these certificates per bearer and he will pay the required fees.

I do not know what to do with this wrong passport. The copy of the letter which I have addressed to Mr. Misra in this connection is also enclosed herewith. Kindly therefore do the needful immediately as I want both the passport and certificate very urgently, and I am simply waiting for them. I am sending my disciple Sriman Cidananda Brahmacari (Mr. Clay Harrold) to see you, and please advise him what to do.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
