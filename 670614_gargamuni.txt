My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 12 1967 and I am glad that you are being assisted by an accountant friend. I quite appreciate your endeavor, and I think the process suggested by your friend in keeping account will save much of your time. I'm glad that you are figuring trial balance every day. This is very nice. I shall be glad to see one of such trial balance---how you are doing.

So far my health is concerned, I am improving daily, but due to my weakness sometimes I feel dizziness. Your prayer and all other boys' prayers has saved me and I hope to render some service to you all for some more years. Please pray to Krishna and He will give us strength and energy in every respect. Thanking you once more. Hope you are well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
