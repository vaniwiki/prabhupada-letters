My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 8, 1969. It is very nice to hear that Gajendra is now taking care in pushing on the Krishna Consciousness Movement. Regarding your coming to me, you are always welcome, and your association is always desired. When I was in San Francisco in 1967, December, after coming back from India, you were so kind upon me. But the thing is that if you come to me, there must be somebody equally expert to manage there. I have heard from Tamala Krishna that there are several very nice devotees there now, and things are being managed automatically. So when I return back to Los Angeles you are welcome to come join me.

Regarding the boy who is interested in making clay Lord Jagannathas, this is all right, but if he can make Radha-Krishna Deities, that will be even better. We are in need of such Deities. So why not ask him to try for this? I have also received the fresh Macadamian nuts which you have sent to me, and they were very delicious. Please offer my blessings to all of the others at the Seattle temple. I hope this will meet all of you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
