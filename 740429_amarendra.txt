Dear Amarendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your recent undated letter along with enclosed new paper clippings and I thank you very much.

I have studied your statements in the papers and you have repeated my ideas and at the same time sounded like a politician, and this combination is very effective. You are certainly the right man for this preaching work. They have taken you as a serious candidate and according to your statement, you feel you may even win. So I am very much encouraged by this political field in America. The people there are very intelligent and they take your statements seriously. I do not need to tell you to push on with this work in serious concentration because I see you are already very determined. In this connection you may see a letter I have just sent yesterday to Rupanuga Goswami in which I have described the need for our political devotees to always stay firmly fixed up in the regulative principles so they will be actually brahmanas. Preach on the basis of the division of the society into four orders, as without this the society is useless and people cannot be happy or even have the necessities of life. I am keeping your newsclippings in a special scrap book and reading them to my important guests in India to show them the potential of this movement. Unfortunately in India they do no take it very seriously; it is up to you in America to actually accomplish something in terms of introducing the principles of Bhagavad gita As It Is into government.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
