My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 9, 1969, and I thank you very much for it. Regarding your reprinting of my letters, if you will not detract from your other important engagements you may do it. I have written to Brahmananda about distributing our books, and should assist him in this important matter. I have considered your thoughts on the matter of our printing press, and for the time, the matter is still pending. Also, I think I have already answered your points in Brahmananda's letter regarding the contributions of the other departments of the New York temple.

I am pleased to note that your store, the Spiritual Sky, is doing successfully. Krishna has given you nice talent for doing business, and I am glad to see that you are using it well. There is no need for you to contribute to my book fund immediately if you are unable. Do it as it becomes convenient for you. Your suggestion that we print transliterations in our future books is very nice, and I think we shall follow this principle in the future.

I hope this will meet you in very good health. Please convey my blessings to your godbrothers and godsisters at your temple.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: Enclosed is the letterhead sample which was sent to me by Rayarama. I think it is nice, and it should be printed in the same colors as the last letterhead. Please hand it over to Rayarama so he may do the needful.
