====== Letter to: Prabhavati ======

My dear Prabhavati dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter of March 22nd, and also your beads, which I have duly chanted. Your letter is very nice and I am very much encouraged to hear of more young American boys and girls who are searching after God. This is natural of course, and one who sticks to Krishna Consciousness purification process, will gradually understand what is God, and our relationship with the Supreme Personality. This is the perfection of human life. Unfortunately, the people of the so-called modern advanced civilization do not know this; they are groping in the darkness of material life, and simply leading others into this darkness. Therefore there are so many frustrated young boys and girls who are searching out God in some way or other, and if they are very fortunate, then they will come to this platform of Krishna Consciousness.

So I am very much pleased to learn that you are chanting and reading Bhagavad-gita, and also helping with the temple activities of cooking and cleaning. This is very good. Please continue in this way, and gradually you will become more and more advanced in this spiritual consciousness, and become happy. If you can paint nice pictures of Krishna and His devotees, then that is also a nice engagement for you. Help Harer Nama in running the temple smoothly, and always remain engaged in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health, and happily chanting and dancing in kirtana.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
