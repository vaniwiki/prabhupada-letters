Dear Sravanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 18, and heard the contents.

The adventures of your transcendental boat party in distributing books from Mayapur to Sagar Island, are very pleasing to me. That you have distributed over 15,000 Bengali books thus far is very [missing word from letter] results.

Your account of the reporter in Kologhat who was converted to our side is an example of successful preaching. If we meet one who is challenging us we should either defeat him or make him our friend.

I know your party is already enthusiastic, but go on increasing and be sure that Krsna will help. Don't be afraid of the demons. As Krsna tells Arjuna, Kaunteya pratijanihi.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
