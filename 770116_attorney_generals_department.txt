Dear Sir,

This is to inform you that I, the undersigned, am the Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and the world leader for all of its branches.

I have appointed Bali Mardan dasa Adhikari (William Berke) as the Governing Body Commissioner for Australia. Mr. Berke is my direct agent in Australia and my official representative, and he has executive authority there in all matters.

Signed:
