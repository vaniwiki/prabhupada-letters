My dear Vijoyadhvaja das:

Please accept my blessings. One letter you have written has been brought to my attention that on the letterhead it is printed that Hare Krishna Movement is affiliated with Sri Sanatana Dharma Sabha. You have also given their %%___%% number. So I would like to know what steps you are taking to register our ISKCON Society there in Fiji.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
