ISKCON RADHA KRISHNA TEMPLE\\
5516 Roosevelt Way N.E.

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard anything from you since last few days; hope everything is going on well. Now regarding the house which you saw on 772 Sherbrooke Street, in front of MacGill University, do you think I shall seriously negotiate for securing the house? The condition is that we have to pay at least $12,000 per year, or $1000 per month. You assured me that by opening Prasadam restaurant downstairs you will be able to raise this $1000. If you are confident about this, then let me know immediately, so I shall renew negotiation with the party. You may see the house once more inside; the process to do so is as follows: "Permission to inspect may be obtained upon application to the Base Construction Engineering Officer, 6769 Notre Dame Street East, Montreal, Quebec (Telephone 255-8811-Local 280), between the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on __working days only__." So you can arrange to see the building by phone and let me know your opinion as soon as possible. Regarding your press, and publication of Back To Godhead in French language: I have not heard anything. I have also not heard anything from Janardan since I have come. I shall be glad to hear from him also. Have you issued any mimeograph copies of Back to Godhead till now?

So I am anxious to know all these informations as well as general information of the temple affairs. Offer my blessings to Himavati and all other devotees. Here the Kirtan party is doing very well. They are selling Back To Godhead nicely and making collection of $30 to $50 daily. Awaiting your early reply, and thanking you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. While in Montreal, there was one small gold plated bowl kept in a gray flannel drawstring bag, kept in the bookcase in the apartment. In packing it is somehow missing. We do not know if perhaps it was left there in that apartment, and if so, could you ask Himavati if she found it in her cleaning of the apartment after we left? It has somehow or other been lost; please check about it as far as possible.

(handwritten) P.S. I have received letter from Shyamasundar in London that the money sent in (unreadable) by the Canadian (unreadable) has now been (unreadable).
