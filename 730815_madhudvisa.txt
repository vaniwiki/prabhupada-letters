====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter and check for 1111.00 dollars.

Regarding the old lady blessing the king, although the part of a constable is not very big, but the blessing is big always. Just as Krishna wants from his devotee a little flower, a little leaf, a little water, or a little fruit, these things are not very big things, still if a faithful devotee offers to Lord Krishna with love and service, Krishna accepts them very gladly. So Krishna's gladness and the devotee's love and sincerity, they are taken into consideration. Similarly when a person offers something in sincere faith and love that is always welcome either by big or small men. So as you are spreading Krishna consciousness in Australia. Hansadutta is also spreading in Germany. He has got 8 vans and they are out regularly preaching sankirtana and selling books and he is now well to do even financially, and I hope you are also well to do, otherwise how you can promise for the next year 11,111.00 dollars. It is very nice. So you continue this system of preaching village to village by increasing the number of Sankirtana parties, it will be appreciated by Guru Gauranga. Do it nicely, you are a fit person, Krishna will bless you.

I hope this letter will meet you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
