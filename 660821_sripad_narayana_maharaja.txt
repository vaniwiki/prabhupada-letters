Sripad Narayana Maharaja,\\
Please accept my dandavats and also please take my blessings.

I think that now you are forgetting me. I will never forget you, but I see that you are forgetting me. How are you? I hope you are all kusala (well and happy) in every way. Now I am staying at the above address. In the middle of September I think that my visa will be finished, so if the government allows I will try to extend it. Very good preaching is going on here. American boys are very beautifully chanting Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. They are chanting loudly. They are eagerly hearing Gita and Bhagavata siddhanta. They are also practicing sadacara, leaving all bad habits. Also, they are taking Mahaprabhu's mahaprasada. By doing this their lives are becoming successful (danyati dhanya). When they do kirtana, dancing with their arms upraised, I remember Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura's predictions and become so pleased. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura wrote very hopefully, "When will that day come when white people, that is Europeans and Americans, join with all others and loudly sing Mahaprabhu's kirtana." So I can see that that day has come.

I am trying my utmost for this. I am also praying for your help and then it will be easier. So if I stay here longer, if they give permission, please send me the following things which I am listing here. You must buy these things and pack them. Book them from Mathura station. If you take this responsibility as I am writing you, you must purchase and then pack. After receiving your letter saying how many rupees are needed, then I will send you the money.

1) One pair of metal Radha-Krsna Deities. Arms length (16")\\
2 Very beautiful dresses, ornaments, crowns. Three changes.\\
3) Ten pairs of good quality karatalas from Navadvipa.\\
4) Three good mrdangas\\
5) One tambura\\
6) One good quality harmonium\\
7) Fifty harinama malas, neckbeads and beadbags\\
8) One book of Sat Kriya Saratdipika (by Gopala Bhatta Goswami and Sanatana Goswami)

If you can find any man who is expert in playing mrdanga, then if you want you can tell him to come here, if he wants to come. If this man agrees to come, then please give him my address.

Let me know what is the cost for all of this, and also what is the packing cost. I will send you that amount. As soon as I get your letter, I shall send you the money. So I hope this time also you will send all that I am wanting and you will help my effort. I have taken so much help from you, and I request that this time also you will help me in this preaching work. I will be so grateful to you. The vigrahas must be purchased in either Mathura or Vrindavana. If it is possible the khola (mrdanga) and karatala should be purchased from Navadvipa. Then in Calcutta my agent can ship it. I know that this will be some trouble, but still I know that you will send it. Receiving this letter, you must give your reply also. I am well.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
