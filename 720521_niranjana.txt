Varanasi

My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 15th, 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. I am glad to hear that our Ramananda Prabhu has visited you in Varanasi and that he has still some feeling for me and for this Krishna Consciousness Movement. So far books are concerned you may get them either from Calcutta or from Bombay. You simply place your order and get the books sent to you, and as they are sold you, send the money for depositing in my book fund. Either Calcutta or Bombay office may inform you of our membership program details also.

I have recently heard from Ksirodakasayi in Vrndavana that he is finding difficulty with Hindi translating work. So I am wondering if you can be of some assistance in this connection. I can understand that now is difficult time for you also because of your examination time. But after your examinations, if you can help this movement of Lord Caitanya expand very widely through India by assisting in translating work, then I shall be very much pleased. (My Guru Maharaja used to say that these literature are the "Brhat Mrdanga," that is to say, the big mrdanga, because like the mrdanga which can be heard from a long distance, simply a few words can have a tremendous effect on millions of people if they are propagated widely.) So it is our duty above all to print these words for the general benefit of mankind. Therefore if you can assist me in this manner then that will be the greatest service.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
