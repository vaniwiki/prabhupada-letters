My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15 May, 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. So far the construction work during monsoon season you may take several quotations for different contractors and accept the best one. If you can get materials donated as you have with the temporary temple structure, that is the best plan. So during rainy season, you may also work at acquiring materials such as sand, bricks, stone chips, etc. If there will be one retired engineer who will help you in this matter just as they have done in Calcutta, that is also a nice proposal. You can put one advertisement in a newspaper and many men will come for interview. Offer them nice place to live with the devotees and all prasadam and other conveniences should be offered to them. And in return they will see to the materials, labor, architects, etc., and give you their expert advice in all matters. Otherwise we have no construction experience and they may try to cheat us. We shall of course continue to also look after all aspects of the building operation, but we should have the help and assistance of a qualified retired engineer. Try to find out such a person. You may consult with Bhavananda and Tamala Krishna in this respect, as the building work in Mayapur is already well under way and it is going very nicely.

I have enclosed herewith some photos from the deity installation of Panca-tattva in Honolulu. I remember that you have good ability to do propaganda work, so I am entrusting that you will try for printing these photos in the big newspapers in Bombay. You can write that they are taken at the deity installation in our Honolulu ISKCON center on May 7, 1972.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
