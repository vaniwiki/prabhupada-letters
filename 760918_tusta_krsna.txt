My dear Tusta Krsna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 11, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. I fully approve of your temple design, it is very nice.

I thank you very much for your very nice presentation of the issue of birth. You have assimilated the process of birth very nicely through the books. This has pleased me very much and I wish that all my students can become as adept at presenting the information in the books like this. You can make this a grand subject for agitation in that country and your preaching on this point alone will make you very famous. Therefore you should speak everywhere on this subject matter from the Bhagavatam and gita and you will be glorified. As the disciple is glorified so also the spiritual master becomes glorified more. Use this issue to advance your propaganda and become a leader in the society.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
