====== Letter to: Shyama Dasi ======

ISKCON CENTER: 439 Henry Street,\\
Brooklyn, N.Y.

My Dear Shama Dasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter undated. You have expressed such nice sentiments and I can see that you are making nice advancement in Krishna Consciousness. By Krishna's mercy you have got a nice devotee husband and nice devotee child also. Raise your son Samba to be a great Vaishnava. That is a very nice service and Krishna will surely bestow upon you all blessings.

Thanking you once more for your kind letter. Hoping you are feeling well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
