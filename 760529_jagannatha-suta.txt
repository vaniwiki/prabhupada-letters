My dear Jagannatha Suta dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of the latest issue of Back to Godhead magazine, Vol. II, no. 6. I am very pleased with the presentation and the articles of this issue. Thank you very much and continue to work very sincerely and Krishna will bless you.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
