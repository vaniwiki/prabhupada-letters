My dear Murtidas:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 3, 1974 as well as your Sankirtana report. I do not know why you are not satisfied with your service there in Delhi. I am very glad that now Tejiyas is regularly collecting and sending to Vrindaban for maintenance, so what is the harm of your helping? This lamentation you have got is not good. __Brahma-bhutah prasannatma/ na socati na kanksati__ [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]]. This is not Krishna consciousness. Do not lament, but go on with your collecting engagement enthusiastically. This is what pleases me. Why are you doubting?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
