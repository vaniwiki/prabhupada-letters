My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 15, 1976, and I have noted the contents with great care.

I want to meet you immediately. If you do not come to Hawaii and you want to come to Los Angeles to meet me, then I can go to Los Angeles immediately. If you actually want to give me service, then you can live with me. I want your service.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
