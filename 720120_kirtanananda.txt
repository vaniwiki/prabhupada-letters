My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 2, 1972, and I am very very pleased to hear from you again and to hear that your roving party is having great success and opening many temples. Actually that is the process, travelling, preaching, taking opportunity wherever Krishna offers it and leaving behind solid centers where propaganda will continue to go on nicely. You are doing very good work and I am very much pleased upon you for such sincere effort. Your program of speaking in colleges and other places and getting paid is very much liked by me; in this way, try to penetrate every school and college and introduce our books profusely. %%___%% is nice you are taking advantage of every opportunity for spreading Krishna Consciousness by speaking on radio, attending engagements, etc. That is the method recommended by my Guru Maharaja---now you are practically demonstrating this fact with good results. So go on like this, you have all of Krishna's blessings.

It is very nice that even the Mayor was convinced by you to buy our Krsna Book. That is a very good sign. Yes, you may name your naughty boy Radha-Damodara because He is always being tied-up with ropes.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
