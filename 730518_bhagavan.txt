====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

My dear Bhagavan dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 11/5/73, and I have carefully noted the contents.

Thank you very much for your complete report of the situation in London. We can understand from this incident that the most important point is that everyone, especially the leaders, must always stick to the basic regulative practices that I have given, especially 16 rounds each day.

So, now what can be done? I expect to be going to London sometime after the first week of June. You may come there at that time.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
