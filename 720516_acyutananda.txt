====== Letter to: Acyutananda ======

Mayapur

My dear Acyutananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 9, 1972, and you have done very nicely in the meeting at Navadvipa. You have done right, that is the proper spirit. Sometime ago you asked my permission for accepting some disciples, now the time is approaching very soon when you will have many disciples by your strong preaching work. Stick to the line of our strong preaching method and many misguided persons will be blessed by your proper guiding.

I have already advised Tamala Krishna Goswami to go to Bangladesh and if you also sometimes join with him and preach this Krishna Consciousness movement amongst the Mohammedans in Bangladesh, it will be a great service. So far the practical side is concerned, as it was possible to attract so many Christians and Jews to this movement in your country, similarly, it is possible to attract the Muslims in Bangladesh by administering the right medicine. So try your best and Krishna will help you. You keep in touch with me like this and I shall try to give you direction as far as possible. But it is a good attempt and we may continue the adventure, praying always Lord Caitanya may bestow His blessings.

You have been offered to be secretary of some committee to protest against Jagabandhu and others claiming to be incarnations. So keep that position, it will be a great credit for our institution. I am enclosing the copy of one letter I have sent to Golan Ahmand Murtuza for your consideration. Thank you very much for helping me in this way.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
