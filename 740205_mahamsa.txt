====== Letter to: Mahamsa ======

Hyderabad

My dear Mahamsa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated December 26th, 1973. I have come back from Europe and America on tour and am now in New Delhi.

I have seen both plans. After taking into consideration all of the points in all of your letters, the points in Sri Raja Sahib Panalalji's letters are all very good. So I prefer his plan the most, particularly I understand from different sources that he may like to construct the Temple portion. So we shall follow Sri Raja Panalalji's plan and under his leadership I think all members will be very much encouraged.

Now in cooperation with all life members of Hyderabad, immediately begin construction and make this one of the great temples of the south.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
