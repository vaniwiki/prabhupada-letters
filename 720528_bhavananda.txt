Calcutta

My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated May 18th, 1972, and I have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I am enclosing herewith one thread and two copies of Gayatri Mantra to be given to Purnamprajna das and his wife Narayani dasi. So you can hold a fire yajna and give them their second initiation. One thing, as you have got no tape of me reciting Gayatri Mantra, you may ask Dayananda in London or Rupanuga in New York to send you one. The tape should be heard through earphones into the right ear.

I am expecting your long report about Mayapur project. Meanwhile, I hope this meets you and your good wife Palika devi in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I think that Malati, Sarasvati, and Srimati are coming there to Calcutta. Why not these girls can assist your wife in worshiping the Deities?\\
