My dear Ananda,

Please accept my blessings. I may inform you that I may go to Vancouver sometimes in the next week or so. When exactly I shall go there, I shall inform you in my next letter.

In the meantime, you please drop this enclosed letter in the mail box, after putting on it an airmail stamp (Canadian), __immediately.__ This letter is very URGENT, and should be posted immediately upon your receipt of it.

And please reply this letter immediately. Hoping you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
