My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 6, which has just now reached me.

Your report on the library party is very encouraging, especially regarding the use of __Bhagavad-gita__ as a text for College courses.

So far the professors helping us, take affidavits from them. If necessary we may ask them to go to court, but as far as possible avoid this if it is unnecessary.

Regarding your coming to be the secretary in February. You arrange amongst yourselves. All of you are welcome.

Thank you for sending the $500 from Detroit. Yes, it was due.

Regarding the difficulty at Chicago airport, my advice is to depend on Krsna.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
