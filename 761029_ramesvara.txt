My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 19/10/76.

It is a fact that we are different from all bogus groups. Now we should present our movement very nicely so that people will be able to understand. We are trying to raise the animal-like humans to real human status.

Yes, this book distribution movie should be excluded. Why has this been taken. Even if there is some bad dealing in the family, it should not be exposed.

What about that book Dialectical Spiritualism edited by Hayagriva? Also, the rejection by the BTG staff has somehow or other alienated Dr. Kapoor. You must carefully oversee which articles are being accepted for BTG.

I approve your efforts to sue this Ted Patrick and his publisher. It must be done.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
