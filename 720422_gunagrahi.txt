My dear Gunagrahi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 21, 1972 and I have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation, I am glad to accept Sriman Larry Kelly as my duly initiated disciple, and I am enclosing a separate letter to him. The extra set of beads that were mistakenly sent to Ayodhyapati Das may be given to him. Ayodhyapati may keep that name and disregard the second one.

In every college and university all over the world, there are so many different courses available to help the student become more entangled in the material world and to forget his real occupation. But none of them offer any instruction on the nature of the spirit soul and his relation with the Supreme Soul. So our program at these colleges is so important, because we are giving all these young people an opportunity to develop real knowledge and make their lives successful. I am so pleased to know that all of you are very enthusiastic for pushing on this program. Always keep this enthusiasm, and increase it more and more, and Krishna will give you all help and guidance.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
