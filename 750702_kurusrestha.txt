Dear Kurusrestha,

Please accept my blessings.

I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 2, 1975. Upon your recommendation, I am accepting the following twice born brahmanas; Koshalendra Das Adhikari, Jyoti Das Adhikari. Enclosed please find their threads sanctified by me. I also accept as my initiated disciples the following devotees and their spiritual names follow: Al Rhiener---Adhata, Cleef Athey---Kamari Das.

Please see that they are chanting 16 rounds & following the four regulative principles.

Now hold a fire sacrifice and let the brahmanas hear the Gayatri mantra tape that I have spoken in their right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
