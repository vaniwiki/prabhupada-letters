Sriman Kirtiraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter dated November 12, 1974 addressed to Brahmananda with enclosed samples of the Christmas cards and the calendar. The pictures are very nice. This sort of painting was done during the Muslim Moghal period. But, we don't encourage Christmas greetings. They are nice pictures undoubtedly.

It is all right, but the general public will take Krishna as an ordinary man. This will deteriorate from the standard. Every picture is with the gopis. People are generally inclined to man and women connection, and by selling these pictures will affirm their sinful activities in the name of Krishna. These are not meant for the common man but for advanced devotees. If we would distribute them, they would misuse it. I hope you can understand this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
