My Dear Shama Dasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice letter and the following presentation for my Lord Sri Sri Radha Krsna sent through Hayagriva Prabhu. One handkerchief cloth finely embroidered in colors for offering with Aratrik, one set of clothes for the Deities, and ISKCON bullets ( sweetballs). They are all very nice and will be properly utilized. Chant always Hare Krsna mantra in any condition of life and you will never feel unhappy. Your husband is staying here with this temple and he is doing nicely.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
