My dear Purnaprajna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7/12/76.

Who says you are a bhajananandi. Don't be a bhajananadi. As soon as you become a bhajananandi you'll be spoiled. You'll be spoiled as Nitai has spoiled himself. You have an intense desire to preach, so do that.

So far as your engagement is concerned, you are already engaged as pujari, so do that and whenever you get time preach Bhagavad-gita.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
