My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 27, 1968 along with one very beautiful picture by Jadurani. I am so pleased to see this wonderful portrait and please convey my hearty thanks to Jadurani for her fine endeavors.

Regarding the article suggested by Rayarama, you are correct in your doubts that Radha-Krishna lila should not be discussed in Back To Godhead. In the __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ there are so many philosophical discussions and we should concentrate on these philosophical aspects. Otherwise the less intelligent will surely understand Radha-Krishna lila as simply nonsense boy and girl sex life. Hanuman Prasad Poddar and company are all mundane types and they have no entrance into actual spiritual activities. Superficially they pose themselves as great devotees, but we can feel their pulse; ultimately they are impersonalists. We should not depend upon writings from such unauthorized sources.

Strictly we should avoid publishing these confidential topics in Back To Godhead. This is dangerous for the conditioned soul. Although such Krishna lila can do some good to the mundane people in the long run, to understand the philosophical aspects of __Bhagavad-gita__ and __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ in the beginning is essential and will make for good stride in spiritual life. I do not know why Rayarama has asked you to send such article. It is not to my sanction. We shall be very careful about mundane sex life. That is the pivot center of conditioned life. You are intelligent enough and I hope that Krishna will help you in these matters.

I hope that you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
