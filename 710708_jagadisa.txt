Toronto

My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 3d July, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear that things are going on nicely in Toronto and that there are so many devotees there and that many of them are qualified for initiation. When I go to N.Y. which should be by the middle of this month, I shall try to visit Toronto also. I shall let you know of this later on when my program becomes fixed up. In the mean time try and take care of all those devotees. You are one of the important members in our society and you have got a good talent to serve Krishna also. So utilize your talents and try and increase the number of devotees as far as possible.

If you find some time, you can come and see me in L.A. and we shall talk of our future programs. I will be here positively up until the 15th July.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
