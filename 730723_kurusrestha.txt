Dear Kurusrestha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 12, and I have carefully considered the contents.

Regarding book distribution, everyone, including book distributers, must follow the standard regulations. Book distribution is preaching, it should not be thought of as done for money. It is executed as a preaching purpose. With these guidelines in mind, try to distribute as many books as possible.

I can understand your concern about the deterioration of the civilization. Yes, the city will be more dangerous place as Kali-yuga advances. It will be very deteriorating. The modern civilization is so corrupt and as sinful activities are more and more committee, the people will be forced to face more troubles, by nature's order. Our business, however, is simply to take shelter of the Hare Krsna Maha Mantra and pray to the Holy Name to give us protection. We shall be unaffected by all that will happen. Krsna will provide us with working facilities. Be assured of this, that the devotees will be protected by the Holy Name. Others will have to suffer in the days that are coming.

On your recommendation I have accepted the two new devotees as my disciples. There names are as follows:

Brad Weinberg; Bhadrayana das

Cathy Serna---Cinmayi dasi

You may hold a fire ceremony for these two, and instruct them conscientiously about the ten offenses in chanting. You may send their beads for chanting to Satsvarupa Maharaja in Dallas. Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
