My dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings.

It has come to my attention that the GBC have not been able to fully participate in the Mayapur festivities due to the annual meeting. Therefore, I am asking all GBC members to come to Mayapur early and hold the meeting in my presence beginning the morning of March 6th.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
