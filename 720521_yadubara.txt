My dear Yadubara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 13, 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very pleased to learn from you your system of filing of all life members to insure that they receive all our literatures. Our life members in India must be kept alive. This literature will keep them alive, plus kirtana. So far the Gujarati translating work done by Srimati Sharda M. Vyasa, for the time being, let us produce magazines in English and Hindi languages and perhaps at some later time we may be able to print in local languages our BTG also. But for that there must be many, many subscribers. So for the time being, you may compile Srimati Vyasa's translation work into a small book and print locally. Gujarati is important language, so I do not think there is lack of market. Your idea for distributing our literatures in outside cities by sending altogether in one parcel to one person is very much appreciated. In this way all our members in one place may be advised to take delivery from him. Just like in Surat. Books may be sent to our Mr. Jariwalla and he can advise the others to take delivery from him. In this way we save postage and we do not risk that some mails may be lost or stolen. I shall look forward to seeing you and your good wife Visakha dasi in Bombay when I return there this autumn.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
