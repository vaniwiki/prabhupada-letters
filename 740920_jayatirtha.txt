My dear Jayatirtha Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 9, 1974 with enclosed deposit slip. Regarding the collections of Gurukrpa Swami I have instructed to Ramesvara that the entire amount should be transferred to the Bombay American Express account. Ramesvara has written that he has sent only a portion of the collection.

Regarding the Dollars 40,000.00 in Hawaii, Dollars 5,000.00 has been lent to Sudama das Goswami, and I have called for Dollars 35,000.00 for purchasing land here in Vrindaban. I have advised Liberty Bank to transfer the amount to Bank of America Branch No. 600, and I have advised Bank of America to transfer the amount via telegraphic transfer to Punjab National Bank New Delhi with special instructions to transfer to their Vrindaban Branch account 668. So kindly see that this is properly done.

We are purchasing two pieces of land for about Rs. 2 lakhs and another piece for Rs. 35,000/-. I am trying to utilize this money for purchasing land here.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 12, 1974 copy of which to all GBC Secretaries. My only requet is we must spend money very cautiously and not to waste. For improvement we can spend. I am simply afraid that money may not be wasted. So when I saw that the sanctuary was not being finished it gave me some agitation in my mind. So if people say it will be better than Birla Mandir, then your labor and expenditure is a success.

I am confident that you are a good manager. So you do the needful, so by your management I will get good satisfaction. You are a good manager and a devotee also. That is a good qualification.
