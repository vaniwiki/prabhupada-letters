====== Letter to: Mahamsa Swami ======

Dist Nadia, West Bengal\\
India

Dear Mahamsa Maharaj,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your report from Hyderbad dated February 15, and have examined the contents.

I am glad you are enthusiastic to carry out my proposal for regular kirtan and prasadam distribution. Not just in Hyderbad, but all over the world expenditure must be met to carry out this simple standard program. Innumerable centers may be opened, but their program is this, kirtan, prasadam and then philosophy.

As for your cow protection on the farm, see that the cows are healthy and strong. Even if a cow doesn't give milk, feed her and just by her stool and urine she will be valuable. The cows are not to be touched for any reason, still they must be protected, not protected only under a certain condition.

As for the children and Gurukula, the village children may learn English, but also they must learn how to plough. It is not that everyone has to be educated. It has become a fashion to learn English and then search out service in the cities. The sudras do not require English, but require how to plough.

As for your request for money from the Trust Account for construction and water development, when you come to Mayapur we shall do the needful.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
