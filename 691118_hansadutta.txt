My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 7, 1969. Whenever there is difficulty in understanding you are at liberty to question me, and it is my duty to give you the right reply as far as possible. There is no cause of anxiety for this method. Questions and answers is the relationship for the Spiritual Master and disciple. The only thing is that questions should be put, as it is advised in the __Bhagavad-gita,__ preceded and followed by submission and service. With this, all questions are bona fide. Regarding the application for the school, I don't think it is very lucrative job. If you want your Spiritual Master to be engaged in some outside job, you must see that He is getting suitable remuneration. I am therefore returning this form as there is no use of it.

Regarding the building, if it is already acquired by the university, then if you purchase, the university authorities must give you guarantee that they will return the money, whatever we have paid, after deducting the usual rent only. On this we can negotiate. For the land, first of all ascertain the real situation as I inquired in my last letter. Then try to secure it. But the university course should be given more stress than purchasing the house or securing the land. This is a very important thing. If such courses are taken by you, then practically there is no need of my employment there. Regarding Citsukhananda, I do not know whether his Spanish education is sufficient for the purpose of right translation, but he can make some portion and send it to me. I shall examine it and then give my direction. In the meantime he can try to translate our __BTG__ and you may try to print a Spanish edition of __BTG__ as you were doing in Montreal of French edition. That will be a nice job for him and an opportunity to nicely expand our literary activities.

Please offer my blessings to Himavati and the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
