====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

Paris, France

Dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings. I was very anxious to receive a letter and your recent report is very encouraging. The pictures sent by you are very welcome and very nice, and I thank you very much.

Now print as many literatures as possible in french language and distribute. If you have any money left from the recent donations of $20,000.00 I request you to spare something to contribute to our Vrindavan construction; it can be sent to account number 230 of the Punjab National Bank, Moti Bagh Branch, New Delhi.

Work combinedly and Europe can be made filled with Sankirtana. I have found all the countries eager to receive our message, especially France and Germany. Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:

> goloker premadhana, harinama-sankirtana, ratina janmila kenetay
> samsara-visanale, divanisi hiya jvale, judaite na kaimu upaya

Sankirtana is imported from Goloka Vrindaban it is not material musical rock and roll. It is actually imported from Goloka. Narottama sings, Everyone is burning in the materialistic way of life. That burning can be extinguished only be employing Hare Krsna maha-mantra. It is a fact that the western countries are in blazing fire of material enjoyment. But as soon as they take to Hare Krsna surely they will find peace and happiness. There is no doubt about it.

I have accepted the devotees you have recommended for first initiation and their spiritual names are as follows:*

John Jean-Guy Bouchre de Belle---Jayantakrt dasa

John, Jean Keraval---Jayakula dasa

Kathy de Poo---Kanti-dasi

Claude Landemaine---Kausi dasa

I will be glad to see you at our meeting in Mayapur.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*You can chant their beads henceforward. Hope to meet you at Mayapur.
