My dear Jayadvaita dasa,

Please accept my blessings. From now on, include one chapter from Srimad-bhagavatam in every issue of Back to Godhead magazine. You can start with the 1st chapter of the 1st canto and continue. You should reproduce the chapter as it is in the book, in other words, with the devanagari script, word meanings, transliteration, etc. If a chapter is very very big, it can be given in two issues.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
