My dear Saradia devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 15th September 1971 and have noted the contents. Krishna has blessed you with a very nice child, Ananga dasi, and I am very much pleased to note how she has got some affection for Lord Jagannatha. That is very nice. And actually there is no harm in her playing with Jagannatha but how the Deity will be kept from being mishandled or kept in a dirty place or even thrown away at the whim of the child? You cannot always check her. Therefore to such a small child the Deity of Lord Jagannatha should not be given. Let her grow up a little so that she can follow some instruction in this connection and then you can give her.

Hoping this will meet you in good health. Please offer my blessings to your daughter also.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
