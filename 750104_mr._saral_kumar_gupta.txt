My dear Mr. Gupta,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 28th, 1974 and have noted the contents. I think the best thing for you would be to come to our center in Bombay and live with us for a while here. We have very nice facilities here and we are constructing more facilities. I will be here until about mid-January and then I will go for 2 months to U.S.A. and South America for preaching. You are welcome to come at any time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
