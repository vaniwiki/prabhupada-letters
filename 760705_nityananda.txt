My dear Nityananda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 1, 1976, and I have noted the contents carefully.

On your recommendation I am accepting Jvarajit das Brahmacari for second initiation. Hold a fire sacrifice and after the fire sacrifice a tape recording of the gayatri mantra should be played into his right ear. Enclosed is one brahmana thread and gayatri mantra sheet. Brahmin must practice cleanliness both externally and internally. Externally he must bathe regularly, and internally he must chant Hare Krishna.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
