My dear Hrdayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 4, 1973. I am very much pleased by the contents.

The green sheets advertising our books to the college professors are very very good. You may send copies to all centers.

Your plan to get a large vehicle for traveling with built in shower, kitchen etc. is approved by me. But you should try to get new, because the old ones are always needing repair. We have seen by practical experience.

Regarding your going with Satsvarupa Maharaja to Europe for one month. I have received one letter from him saying that he could not go because his presence is too important at our Gurukula in Dallas. It is a fact that Gurukula must be always carefully supervised, it is one of our most important projects. So you can correspond with him in this connection.

Thank you very much for your sincere efforts in pushing forward this Krsna Consciousness Movement.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
