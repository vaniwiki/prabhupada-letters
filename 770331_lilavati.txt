My dear Lilavati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated December 3, 1976, along with the enclosed manuscript. Your letter has taken a very long time to reach me.

Our literature is not sentimental stories. It is meant to be understood by the intelligent class of men. Children and those with child-like mentalities will do better to chant "Hare Krishna" and take prasadam. We cannot water down the philosophy to make it more palatable. Our books must remain as they are. Do not waste your time anymore with such attempts. We are not going to publish it. Whatever books we have got, let them try to understand, and if they cannot then let them chant "Hare Krishna" and take prasadam.

Hoping this finds you and your husband well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
