My dear Ananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have learned from Mandali Bhadra and Vrndavanesvari that you have been disturbed in your center by some rascal boys, and now you are living with Mandali Bhadra. So what is your program? Would you like to close the Vancouver center, or are you finding out some better place? I have received one letter from Rupanuga in Buffalo that two boys are going to Toronto to open a center there. Would you like to go there for the time being, or will you try for another place to keep yourself in Vancouver?

At present I am living in New Vrindaban. It is a very nice place, but there is no facility of modern amenities. It is completely aloof from city life, and we have to adopt so many things. In comparison to city life it is very inconvenient. But still the atmosphere here is very pleasant. As of yet I have still received no answer from Annapurna.

I am awaiting your reply to the above points. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
