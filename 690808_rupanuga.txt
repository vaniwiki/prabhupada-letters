My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter of August 3rd, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. In further reference to your question about the form of the spirit soul of the conditioned living entity, there is a spiritual form always, but it develops fully only when the living entity goes back to Vaikuntha. This form develops according to the desire of the living entity. Until this perfectional stage is reached, the form is lying dormant like the form of the tree is lying dormant in the seed. Regarding the higher school of theology, according to the Vedic system it is not at all difficult. The students are taught by the Spiritual Master, or the teacher, and the students themselves go from door to door for begging alms, and because everyone's son is in the asrama, nobody declines to give alms. So there is no financial difficulty at all; but I do not know what to do in your country. There are so many laws. We have to adjust things to the circumstances. I think as soon as our institution becomes formal, as Tamala Krishna is doing through the lawyer, it will be easier to start a theological school.

Regarding Krishna Devi's proposal, that is too immature now. We have to see the boy's tendencies first. This will be judged when he is at least 16 years old. Before that, up to the 15th year, he should be given all sorts of education and training as brahmacari. We can't impose anything from so early age, because when he is grown up he may not like the idea. So all this contemplation is premature. For the present your duty is to make him healthy and strong, physically and spiritually. Of course, if our Krishna Conscious children are to marry, the marriage must be performed within our group.

I am very pleased to learn of your nice progress in Sankirtana and __BTG__ sales. In every temple we are seeing great success in these areas. It is also encouraging that your course is again approved in the university, and I have full confidence in you to do your duties very expertly. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am enclosing herewith a review of our books. Please try for such review in Buffalo papers. This will be nice. ACB
