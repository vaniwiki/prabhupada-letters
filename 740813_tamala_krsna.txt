My dear Tamala Krishna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated July 27th along with BBT loan proposal. Yes, regarding the buses, Bali Mardan must give you the loan.

Regarding the society's leaders emphasizing business, you should understand what is the meaning of business. Business means to help the preaching. Preaching needs financial help, otherwise, we have no need for business. So far as I understand, our book business is sufficient to support or movement. I do not want the preaching to be at the expense of managing. Manager must also be a preacher otherwise who will want to follow him?

Regarding your visiting centers and giving advice on management and preaching in many zones, yes, do it cooperatively.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. We have to plan our activities in such a way that we become stronger, not weaker. Physically I am becoming weak, so you boys become stronger. Also, at Mayapur they are wanting money and grains, so what are you doing about this?\\
