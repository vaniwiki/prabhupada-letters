My dear Mr. Cohen,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter April 10, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am happy to hear that you are attracted to the Krishna Consciousness movement. Your talents for making movies can be engaged very nicely in Krishna's service. I think in this connection, you may contact Sriman Yadubara dasa adhikari, 3764 Watseka Ave., Los Angeles, Ca. 90034. He is very experienced at making Krishna Conscious movies. He may be able to give you some good advice.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
