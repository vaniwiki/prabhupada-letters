Dear Sir,

__Re My savings Bank account 1452__

With reference to the above I beg to inform you that since a year I am out of India, and I may be required to live here a few days more. I am therefore anxious to know my above account position and shall be glad to have a statement of account since June 1st 1965 on which date I see my credit balance Rs. 2206.05.

I may further inform you that my American friends will purchase some books of mine from India and I wish to send the money for deposit in a separate account namely __A.C. BHAKTIVEDANTA BOOK A/C.__ I therefore request you to open the above account immediately and transfer Rs 100/- from my present account to this new account. And on hearing from you I shall send all the deposits money to this account.

Please let me know the number of this new account A.C. BHAKTIVEDANTA BOOK ACCOUNT. Also please send me a cheque book containing ten cheques to my above American address. Also please let me know the present or current exchange rate for American dollars in Indian rupees.

I hope you will please note the above points carefully and reply this letter at your earliest opportunity and oblige.

Thanking you in anticipation,

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
