My dear Purusottama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 19, 1968. I am glad to understand that everything is very nice in New York Temple, and Krishna is attracting many new devotees lately. The more you sincerely serve Krishna, the more He will send you similar devotees to assist you.

Regarding the NGO section of the United Nations, I am enclosing herewith a statement addressing Mr. David J. Exley, explaining the very importance of our movement. You can inform him that the Gaudiya Math Institutions in India and in England, are also part of this Institution. And as my God-brothers have established in different parts of India and the East hundreds of institutions for this purpose, I am also trying to open such similar centers in the Western countries. Our activities are related with Gaudiya Math on the basis of Krishna Consciousness. So through all these Maths and other various institutions, we can disseminate all information about the U.N. in various parts of the world.

Both of you shall go and try to convince this gentleman about the importance of our movement, and the rest will depend on Krishna as He desires. We shall try our best and the ultimate result may be dependent on the dispensations of Krishna. These institutions are related with us and each of the Maths are the headquarters for hundreds of branches, and we can disseminate much information about the U.N. through them.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Because they are so desperate for peace in the East, it may be a good idea to expand on the point that we have very widespread influence all over the Eastern world, and we can spread much good peace-propaganda for the U.N. there.\\
P.S. I am enclosing herewith some of the certificates of Godbrothers in Gaudiya math institutions. I think in my apartment there are photostat copies of them. If they are there please submit those photostat copies them, the typed ones. Also please let me know if Brahmananda has received shipping documents from the United Shipping Corporation of Calcutta. Also from S. S. Brijbasi Co.
