My dear Nandalal devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 6, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding the hole in the Deity, no do not repair it like you have stated. You can fill up the hole with wax, and go on worshiping.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
