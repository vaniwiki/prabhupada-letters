My dear Sriman Ramakrishnaji,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 1, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

I shall be returning to Bombay on or about August 14, 1976, after which time I shall be able to attend the Coordinating Committee meeting when the date is fixed up. After visiting our Washington, D.C. centre I shall be going on to New York where we are scheduled to have our Rathayatra procession down 5th. Avenue on July 18th, then London, Paris, Rome, Tehran (Iran) where we have our centers, and reaching Bombay thereafter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
