My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 2, 1969, and it is very encouraging that Saci Devi is coming. I know she is a very nice girl, so if you agree to marry her, then you must treat her very nicely so that you can live very peacefully. Our marriages are never meant for separation. You must live together very peacefully in all circumstances. Our Vamanadeva, after marriage, has opened a new center in St. Louis, and they are doing very well. So far as Hansadutta is concerned, immediately there is no possibility of his leaving Berkeley center. It is a very important center, and as you say he is doing very well you require to stay there, husband and wife, and improve the center very magnificently. If you want to open a center, you are already experienced, and you should do it independently.

Please continue to read the literature very attentively. Try to understand very soberly and you will feel ecstasy undoubtedly. The more we understand the spiritual literatures the more we become engladdened. Lord Caitanya has written __ananda ambhudhi bardhanam.__ This means the ocean of bliss is always increasing. So continue to execute your duties with enthusiasm and patience, and I am certain Krishna will be pleased make you successful on all accounts. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
