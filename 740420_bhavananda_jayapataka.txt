Dear Bhavananda and Jayapataka Maharajas,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters of April 15, 1974 and I thank you.

My point of view is this: whatever money you require I am already sending and will continue without hesitation to send, but I must be satisfied the money is properly spent. The first point is if I send you money for a certain purpose it must be spent for that purpose. Money for land must be spent for land purchase; if I send money for constructing of a kitchen it must be spent for that.

Also, if you purchase land it must be properly utilized. It is no use purchasing land to be wasted by costly laborers. If you actually produce some grains or vegetables, then where is the necessity for further money for maintenance. For maintenance we require 100 rupees per head without any risk for purchasing lands and cultivating the same. I understand there are only 20 men there at present, so utmost 2,000 rupees is necessary for maintenance. I am not competent to understand everything concerning what you plan to do, but that is my rough estimate.

You have tried to explain by long letter which I have not gone through yet. In the meantime go on the above principle: money spent must be used for that purpose intended. That will keep it very clear.

I know you are working hard and sincerely. I have no business to criticize you but as head of the institution or your spiritual master, it is my duty to find out your faults. Even Caitanya Mahaprabhu presented himself as faulty before his spiritual master. To remain faulty before the spiritual master is a good qualification so he is subjected to rectification. But if one thinks he is all perfect then there is no scope for rectification. Don't be sorry when I find fault. That is my primary duty. Canakya pandita says one must find fault with disciples and sons, it is good for them.

I hope things are going nicely and progressively. The money is with Giriraja: he has send Rs 50,000 in two installments, the balance is kept with him and you will get it timely. Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Previously, eighty thousand rupees was taken from Hyderabad for Mayapur. (RS 80,000.00) I am not sure of the exact sum but Gargamuni Maharaja will have a record of it. So now that Hyderabad construction is going on, this money is required by them. Please see that it is returned by you as soon as possible.
