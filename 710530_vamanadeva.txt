My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 24th April, 1971 and have noted the contents. Also the newspaper article enclosed was very nice.

Thank you for your decision. Please go on preaching and improve your Krishna Consciousness. There is no necessity of attending a university. We have got enough of a university educational program in our Krishna Consciousness movement. There are so many books to study and they have to be introduced also by preaching. So engage yourself in this way. If we have to spend time learning something, then where is the time for service? So utilize what talents you have already in Krishna's service and He will give you the intelligence to increase more and more.

Hoping this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
