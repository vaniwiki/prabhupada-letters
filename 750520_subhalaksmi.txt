My dear Subhalaksmi devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter along with your daksina of $80. Thank you very much. Please continue to sell my books as much as possible in huge quantities. This is very pleasing to me. Try to maintain the standard of a perfect person as is given in the Bhagavad-gita, and do not deviate from this wonderful method of Krishna consciousness. Follow the rules very carefully, chant at least 16 rounds, and read our books over and over.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
