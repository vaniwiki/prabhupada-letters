My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 11, 1969 and I have noted the contents. The picture of Vasudeva exchanging the babies is not correct because Nanda Maharaja should not be in this scene. Vasudeva silently exchanged babies with the sleeping Yasoda, and neither Yasoda nor Nanda Maharaja knew about this till long after. Yasoda had just given birth to her girl baby, and having fell asleep right after this birth, she did not even know that the child she had given birth to was a girl. So please correct this error somehow. In the meantime I am awaiting the other paintings which are sending to me in Los Angeles. Hope this meets you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
