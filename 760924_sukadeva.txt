My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7th inst. and have noted the contents. Gurukrpa Swami is coming there, and whatever he may advise may be done, regarding the deities.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
