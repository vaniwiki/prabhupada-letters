Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Vasudeva:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 5th and 6th April, 1977, and I have noted the contents respectively.

Enclosed please find a "message" which you can use when you print your souvenir issue commemorating the opening of the temple. Also enclosed is an article entitled "Who is Harijan?" written by Tamala Krishna Goswami which can be included in the issue. I shall try to send you a special article by separate post in the absence of which you can print any of my shorter essays like "On Chanting the Hare Krishna Mantra" which you can take from by book or our Back To Godhead magazines.

Regarding Bali Mardan, he is now here in Bombay and will be in charge of our international guesthouse. I have suggested that Ramesvara Swami be the GBC for Fiji, and I think Tamala Krishna has already written you about this.

Your suggestion that I come to Fiji for recovering my health is very good. We are now thinking of going to Kashmir. When my program is definitely fixed up then I will let you know further. I know that your new house is very nice with a good view and that you and your family will take very good care of me. Let us see our program here then I shall let you know. My health is very slowly improving. I am simply trusting in Krishna.

I hope this meets you and all your family members very well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
