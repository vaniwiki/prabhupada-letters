My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. In Bombay I have paid in advance Rs. 25,000/- to Bhavananda Maharaja for Food Relief poor feeding; so whatever you have collected for poor feeding may be sent to Bombay Bank of America.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
