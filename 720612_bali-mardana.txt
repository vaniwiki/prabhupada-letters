My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated June 4, 1972, along with the copy of our latest book, The Perfection of Yoga, and the article from "Publisher's Weekly" magazine. I am very much pleased that you are publishing these small booklets. They are so much attractive that any man will purchase one without hesitation. Many of these small booklets should also be dispatched to India, but I think for that Dai Nippon may be able to supply in large quantities.

I am happy to learn from you that both the Press and the New York temple are running along very smoothly and that all our programs there are increasing. That should be, I expect that. It should not be too difficult for our New York center to be the leading book distributor of the movement.

Now I am feeling inclination for philosophy, and I want to retire into the background for translating my Srimad-Bhagavatam more and more. I am always glad to hear from my beloved disciples, but I am finding difficulty to reply so many letters daily, so I want to encourage the disciples to refer their questions as much as possible to the GBC men and other senior students. So if you will encourage them in that way, I shall get some relief, but if anyone has got any important or personal questions I do not mind if they write to me, I shall be always glad to hear from them.

I am enclosing one article written by one man in Bombay, Mr. Vachista, who is highly impressed by our movement. If you publish this article, will that be a good proposal? At least I think in India there would be good market for such booklet, but I do not know what is the possibility of distributing this article in your country. You may advise me in this respect.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
