====== Letter to: Jayapataka ======

Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Swami:

Please accept my blessings. This is to inform you that yesterday Giriraja has sent by T.T. Rs. 2,25,000/- to American Express Bank a/c No. 090031. Now the wall and proposed rooms and other works must be finished by Gaura Purnima.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
