====== Letter to: Pradyumna ======

My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 28, 1969, sent by Special Delivery, and I am replying as follows. If Mr. Vora is going to Bombay, he can find out some reliable supplier of musical instruments. One friend gave me the following address: M/s D.S. Ramsingh & Bros., Harmonium Manufacturers and dealers in musical instruments; 344-48, Manchram Bldg., Sarder Vallabhai Patel Road, Bombay-4. He quoted for musical instruments as follows: Harmonium of double reed @Rs 260, Harmonium of triple reed @Rs 350, Tanpura @Rs 100 to Rs 200, mrdangas (wooden made) @Rs 150, khanjani @Rs 10 to Rs 15. What I want Mr. Vora to do is see this firm, or any other reliable firm which can regularly supply us with first quality instruments. The price quoted by the party appears to be high, so Mr. Vora has to inquire from other sources also, and he may purchase a sample transaction of one harmonium, one Maha-rashtrian mrdanga (wooden made), and a few first class kanjanis. He may bring with him as his personal property or he may see the director of the Scindia Steam Navigation Co., Sumati Morarji. If she takes charge for dispatching the goods on her ships, that is very good, but because it is a very small quantity, it may be better to bring them personally. If Mr. Vora sees Srimati Sumati Morarji, she will at once know me by my name, and she'll arrange everything. The sum and substance is that we want some reliable commission agent or supplier who can supply us regularly these things. If Sumati Morarji gives us the facilities of free shipping, that is all right. Otherwise we shall get them sent, freight paid by us.

Regarding Baroda Bank, although I have got money, if the goods are dispatched through customs, then we will have to send the money from here. But if Mr. Vora either brings them personally or delivers it to Sumati Morarji as a free gift, then there will be no customs botheration. In that case I can give Mr. Vora a check on the %%___%% Otherwise, we will have to send American dollars. I am stressing again that we have to find out a reliable person who can regularly supply us with goods from India. This is the sum and substance, and now you can do the needful. If Mr. Vora wants to be our supplying agent, we have no objection. Let him make arrangement for supplying these goods as I have described, first quality and good price, and book it through a reliable shipping agent or through Scindia Steam Navigation Co. There will be regular business, and he will make good profit. But ask him not to make more than 10% profit over purchasing price. You may also ask him to bring with him a pair of cookers which are available in Pydhani brass utensil shops. The cost will be about $3.00, so if he can bring with him at least two cookers, that will be very nice. So things are explained above as far as possible, and now you can arrange with him.

Regarding Gayatri Mantra, Arundhati's insistence is not very good. If she wants to offer prasadam to the Deities, she can simply chant Hare Krishna Mantra. There is no need of chanting Gayatri Mantra. One has to be formally accepted by the Spiritual Master for this, so you can tell her this fact. That is not the system. For the time being, if Arundhati wants to offer prasadam, the Hare Krishna Mantra will do.

I hope this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. You have written nothing about Arundhati's training for the Compositor machine.
