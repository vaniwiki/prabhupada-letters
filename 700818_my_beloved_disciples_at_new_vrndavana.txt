My dear Shamadasi, Theresa, Sanat Kumar Brahmacary, Jagatananda, and Tarunidasi; My Dear Jadunandan, Chris, Stan, Patita Pavana, Barbara, Sandinidasi, Pamela and Maria; My Dear Ekendra and DDD; My Dear John, Nathan, Richard, Jackson, Rasananda, Kenneth and Troy; My Dear Trivikram, Yaminidasi, Theresa, Devakinandan, Ranadhir, Martin and Bhagavatananda; My Dear Peter, Girish, Birbhadra, Paramananda and Satyabhama,

Please accept my blessings. I was so happy to receive all your nice letters from New Vrindavana and have read them all with great pleasure. Now, however, I have come to Japan to arrange for some printing work and I am staying at our Tokyo center.

I am very much encouraged to know that you are all advancing in Krsna consciousness at New Vrndavana and I am very much eager to see your transcendental community grow still more to become and ideal Krsna conscious asrama. So please follow the regular schedule of Krsna activities and be happy.

I hope you are all well in Krsna consciousness.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
