My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. I have to talk with you in detail. Everything can be adjusted by our sincere will to serve Krishna. I do not know why Sudama and yourself are trying to organize another party by some reason or other. The best solution was suggested by me that both you and your wife may stay with me. After all, both of you are my disciples. It is my duty to guide you for spiritual advancement.

So, I wanted to go to Hawaii immediately, but the Bombay business has obliged me to stay here a few days more. After this, I have a program to go to Mexico, so I was thinking of going via Hawaii and to meet you all to study personally what can be done for all the misunderstandings that have taken place. The money you wanted to return, kindly send directly to either of these banks in Bombay: Bank of America, a/c no. 16026, INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS "MAYAPUR VRINDAVAN FUND." __or__ First National City Bank, Bombay a/c no. 17168, "ISKCON MAYAPUR VRINDAVAN FUND."

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
