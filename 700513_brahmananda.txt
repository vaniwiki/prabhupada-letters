My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 9th May, 1970.

Regarding the dummy BTG, I compared with the Japanese BTG, and it appears that the present one is quite inferior. The price is higher and the subscription card is not to be included, and the size is smaller also. So considering all these points it is inferior to the Japanese BTG. Now because there is no alternative we must get them printed here, but as you are going to Japan, I think you will be able to find out some printer who will be regularly supplying.

You have asked me to send you a check for $4,500, but this is for the first time you have asked me to pay on account of BTG, and this point I have already explained to Gargamuni. So far I understand from Gargamuni that you misunderstood me that I want to take the management of BTG I never meant like that, neither I have got any time to tax my brain in that way. So you shall continue the management of BTG, and ISKCON Press is meant for that purpose.

Formerly when it was in the hand of Rayarama he was managing separately, then it came to your hand and the management is going on, but you never asked me for any payment in the matter of BTG. So I have asked Gargamuni to send you back the check which I understand you sent to him on this account for $5000. So I am simply interested in the book distribution, and whatever collection is made in this department may be paid to me either by you or by Gargamuni; and when there is question of printing books certainly I shall pay as I have been doing---that will simplify the matter.

When you come here I will talk with you further on this matter, but what I want is that I may not tax my brain in the management of many departments.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
