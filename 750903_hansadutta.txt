My dear Hansadutta das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of three copies of the new German edition of Caitanya Caritamrta Chapter 7 & 8. It is very nice. The printing is very good. Bengali types in a German country, is very good. They will take it.

Did Dr. Wolf-Rottkay help edit this book? I do not see his name mentioned. He is professor, so if you mention his name in the book, it will be impressive. When I was in Los Angeles he was coming to see me everyday. Also on the spine of the book under the BBT logo the words "Bhaktivedanta Book Trust" must appear. They are doing this on all the new volumes of Caitanya Caritamrta from Los Angeles.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
