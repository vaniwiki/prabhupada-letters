My dear Mr. Karl,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 20th, 1975 and have noted the contents carefully. I wish to thank you very much for your reading our books so carefully and scrutinizingly. Any man who read these literatures will find a storehouse of transcendental information. I hope you will continue to study so nicely on a daily basis as you have described in your letter.

Regarding your question, you may refer to Ādi-lila, Chapter 6, Text 79 along with the purport, (Caitanya-caritamrta). The answer is there. The basic understanding is that Sada-Siva is an expansion of Maha-Visnu and that same Sada-Siva incarnates as Advaitacarya. Therefore, since Advaitacarya is an incarnation of Sada-Siva who is non-different from Maha-Visnu, we can say that Advaitacarya is an incarnation of Maha-Visnu. It can be said both ways, that He is an incarnation of Sada-Siva or Maha-Visnu.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
