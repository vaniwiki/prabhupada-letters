====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

Detroit

My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter with enclosures dated 12th October, 1971 and have noted the contents. It was a great shock for me to hear about the death of Jananivasa and Will, so untimely. In such case we should hold special condolence meeting in our centers and pray for his being taken to Krishna Loka by the grace of Lord Krishna. After the demise of a devotee some special feast preparations should be offered to Lord Krishna and prasadam should be distributed.

So far your points for improvement of BTG, they are very nice in general. Our policy is to satisfy Krishna and keeping this point in view you should consult the GBC members and discuss these points and do the needful.

Yes, certainly Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha and Krishna will grace your temple. Just now arrangements are being made. One pair exactly like those in Boston will soon be on their way to Detroit. I will let you know when final shipping arrangements have been made.

So far purchasing of automobiles, use your discretion. If they cannot be donated then try for at least 50% commission.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
