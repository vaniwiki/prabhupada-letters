====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

Los Angeles

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received one letter from Tamala Krishna Goswami which is very encouraging regarding his preaching program in the United States. He has requested to take a loan from BBT for $30,000 to purchase three more buses. I fully authorize this. Therefore please do the needful. Fifty percent of BBT funds ar for printing books and fifty percent are for construction of temples. So these buses are like temples, moving temples. Therefore you should give him the loan.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
