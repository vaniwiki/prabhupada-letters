My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 15/4/72, and I have noted the contents. Soon there are many men coming to India from USA and England, so you can take five men and do the needful, just as Tamala Krishna is doing at Mayapur. Ask Karandhara to send them immediately. They have spent Rs. 90/- for one hut and Rs. 1800/- in Vrindaban for the fence, so you can send them some money immediately for these items. I have just received report from Brahmananda in Nairobi and they are doing very nicely, so I don't think he shall have to return to India for the time being.

Ksirodakasayi is in charge of the building and other things in Vrindaban, along with Gurudasa and you are in charge of the financial aspect of Vrindaban project. I have asked that the fence be built, and they have got it done very cheaply. You can sometimes go to Vrindaban to see, but your job is to take the Sankirtana party out for collecting. They shall be able to manage very well there, of this I am sure. So far decorating my rooms, give this job to Yamuna. Collection of grains has been done very nicely by Gurudasa from the American government. Plans of the temple, detailed program---all these things are already taken care of, they are not your job. The real thing, __money,__ is in your hands. Tamala Krishna has already taken his party to Bangladesh, so any assistance you can give him by way of advice or addresses will help. But you should concentrate on book sales and collecting with your SKP in various rich quarters in India. Now we have sent many books lately to India, Gurudasa has got a full description, and he is getting CCP clearance permission. Now you settle amongst yourselves on some programme for distributing these and many other books, I don't care at what price %%__%% sell, because __all__ you can collect will go for building for Vrindaban, and Mayapur only, no question of 50/50 division. The books are being sent to you free, so you raise money %%__%% In the absence of Madhudvisa, you take charge of the school %%__%% Sarasvati's arati will help. I have given her the name leader %%__%% very happy when she's called leader. Our Purusottama das brahmacari was criticizing me for having little attachment with Sarasvati, and for that offense he had to leave the Society.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
