My dear Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much pleased to receive your letter dated 27th January, 1971. I have been thinking of you and not having heard anything from you in such a long time, so I'm very much pleased with your letter. Recently Nandarani wrote me a letter and I have replied that.

I understand that both Nandarani and yourself are advancing in Krishna Consciousness and that is a great solace for me. We require many boys and girls like you to spread this movement. Please do it carefully and help others to become Krishna Conscious. I'm sure that Karandhara and your good self, assisted by the others are doing well in that center. I shall soon be returning and shall be glad to see how things have improved much during my absence.

Also I am very pleased to know that the Deity thrones are now in hand. I have already dispatched big Deities like the ones in London, given by Mr. Birla. I hope by this time you might have received shipping documents and on receipt of this you do the needful. As soon as the Deities are received, you should prepare very nice gorgeous sets of clothes for the Deity.

Now the most important point is to recruit life members as many as possible. Please let me know how many you have made. The money received of the life membership fees should be divided into two: 50% for building fund and 50% for my book fund. By distributing of our books and literatures through this program of life membership, our institution can become greater and greater all over the world.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
