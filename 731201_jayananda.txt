My dear Jayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated November 13, 1973. I was very happy to hear from you. I am always thinking of you and praying to Krsna for your advancement in Krishna Consciousness.

That you are engaged in street Sankirtana in San Francisco is fully approved by me. That you are feeling more and more enthusiasm by doing this is quite natural as Sankirtana is our life and soul. My Guru Maharaja used to say, "One who has got life, he can preach."

Yes, I remember the old days in San Francisco. Krsna has been so kind upon me to have sent so many sincere disciples to help me push on this Movement on behalf of my Guru Maharaja. You continue with your program there in San Francisco, always strictly keeping our principles and Krsna will bless you with greater and greater realization of the importance of this Movement. I am dependent upon you, my older disciples, to carry it on.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Trayi devi dasi, and thank her on my behalf for the three nice drawings of Krsna lila. Also, please thank Bhavatarini devi dasi for her drawing of Gopala Krsna. So far how she can serve me, the best service is to chant Hare Krsna always and spread it to every town and village.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
