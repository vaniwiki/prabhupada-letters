Birla House\\
Mt. Pleasant Road\\
Bombay-6

My dear Rameswar Dayalaji Birla,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to inform you that the two pairs of Radha Krishna Deities have arrived in Bombay from Jaipur. So out of the four Deities, two of Krishna and two of Radharani, one Deity of Radharani is broken by the hand. So kindly do the needful for replacing this Deity and oblige.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Yours in the service of Lord Krishna,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
