Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received one letter from Asita dasa wherein he claims that he was all of the sudden asked to go away from Mayapur. What was the situation? Kindly let me know.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
