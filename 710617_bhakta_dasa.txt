My dear Bhakta Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 19th May, 1971 and have noted the contents with pleasure. It is so much encouraging to note how nicely your program is going on there. In all aspects of temple life you seem to be doing so nicely and Sankirtana is being well received also. So continue your program with all enthusiasm for making ISKCON San Diego a grand success. It appears that Krishna has His blessings upon you, so continue as you are doing and you will get more blessings from Krishna. Thank you very much. And Krishna will supply you everything. If the prescribed rules and regulations are followed, then there will be no scarcity.

Presently I am in Bombay and on the 20th of this month I will be going to Moscow for five days. Thereafter I will be going to Paris and London. I was wanting to go to Rathayatra festival in San Francisco, but I don't think that is possible because there are no direct flights from Moscow to California. But after the London program, I will go directly to U.S.A.; N.Y. and then L.A.

Please offer my blessings to all the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
