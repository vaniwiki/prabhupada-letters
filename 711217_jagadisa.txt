My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of November 28, 1971, and I am pleased to see that things are going on nicely in Canada under your supervision. I am especially glad that you are having so many festivals in the colleges and schools. Do you sell many books there? That is the success of your festival---if people buy many books. At our Delhi Festival we sold more than 12,000 BTG's.

I am encouraged to see your report of books sold, because it proves that you consider it your responsibility to see that more and more people are reading our literature. Actually, this is the solid basis for our preaching work---no other movement has got such profuse authority for preaching, and if someone reads our Krishna philosophy he becomes convinced. So try to increase the effect of preaching by distributing many books and magazines, and this is the basis of your all success.

Our travelling Sankirtana parties are having good success all over the world. I think you initiated this travelling Sankirtana in Canada, so now you go on introducing it in other places and perform that program very nicely. I am very very pleased to see our Sankirtana travelling parties are having good results.

I hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
