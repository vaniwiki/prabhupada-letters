My dear Ayodhyapati das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your undated letter and I thank you for it. Your siddhanta is correct to the sastra and in this way go on reading books and have the correct perception and Krsna will help you. __siddhanta baliya citte na kara alasa iha haite krsna lage sudrdha manasa__ [Ādi 2.117]. A sincere student should not neglect the discussion of such conclusions, considering them controversial, for such discussions strengthen the mind. Thus one's mind becomes attached to Sri Krsna.

You should be always alert in understanding the sastric conclusions that will help you, otherwise we can be misled by bogus philosophies. I am very pleased that you are studying the books. This will make you happy and successful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
