My dear Aditya,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28th January, 1976.

The spirit soul is equal in either a man or woman. One who is actually engaged in the service of Krishna, there is no such distinction as man or woman. In the Bhagavad-gita, 6th Chapter, 1st Verse it is stated __anasritah karma-phalam karijam karma karoti yah/ sa sannyasi ca yogi ca na niragnir na cakriyah__ [[books:bg:6:1|(Bg. 6.1)]]. Anyone acting for Krishna, he is a sannyasi or sannyasini. It is also stated: __striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te'pi yanti param gatim.__ So spiritually everyone is equal. But materially a woman cannot be given Sannyasa. But you should not be bothered because you are serving on the spiritual platform.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
