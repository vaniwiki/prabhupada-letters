====== Letter to: Nayanabhirama ======

My dear Nayana Bhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Sept. 10th, 1970 and noted the contents. I have not yet received the bead bag sewn by your good wife, but I beg to thank you for the check of $100 forwarded to my book fund. I am so glad that you are now together, husband and wife, engaged in serving Krsna as an ideal Krsna Conscious householder couple.

Do not be discouraged that you are only four devotees at present moment in Philadelphia. Simply you very strictly follow the routine schedule of devotional service and chanting Hare Krsna and do your best to spread this Movement amongst the local people. Krsna will send you many more sincere souls very soon to help you. So go on with your work with new efforts of increased enthusiasm and Krsna will bless you more and more in Krsna consciousness. Please increase your program of distribution to the public as well as trying to place our books and magazines in the libraries. This is very successful in libraries in other centers.

I am very glad to know that Mr. Gajjar is continuing his interest in our Movement, so please encourage him in this way. It is very good that is brother, Mr. Navin Gajjar, from Taiwan, is also interested in a center there. Please contact Bali Mardan immediately in this connection. He has got great eagerness to open branches in that part of the world and he has got already invitation from Hong Kong and Fiji. So this will be added impetus to his work if you kindly give him further information regarding our friend in Taiwan.

I am very happy to know that Mrs. Max, the proprietor of Paragon Bookstore has remembered me and I have written her one note which I have sent in care of you for forwarding to the proper address in New York.

Please offer my blessings to all the devotees there and your good wife.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
