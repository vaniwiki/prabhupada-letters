My dear Amogha das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9 February, 1976.

The guests must be pleased when they give a donation. That shows they are pleased.

I have received a letter from Gopala Krishna wherein he states that you are distributing our books to libraries. That is solid. Simply by bluffing words these bogus gurus and yogis are actually accomplishing nothing. But when they people read our books then they will get good opinion.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
