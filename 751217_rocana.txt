My dear Rocana das,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your letter dated November 30, 1975. First of all produce your own food grain, milk and vegetables, eat as much as absolutely necessary, don't eat more, and in this way keep your health. Follow the regulative principles and then if there is time left over you can divert your attention. But I think you should not waste your time in any other thing except Devotional service and maintain the body in proper order. Unnecessarily you should not waste your valuable time.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
