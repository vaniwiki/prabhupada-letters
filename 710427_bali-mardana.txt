Penang

My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22nd April, 1971 from Penang, and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, the registered documents have been dispatched to you and I hope you have received them by now. So far as a $50,000.00 donation from Kamala Devi, I was informed by Hanuman Dasa in that way.

This plan to go to Russia is still underway and it may be that after returning from Sydney and attending one large function in Calcutta from 14th to 24th April, at that time I may be going to Moscow. So my going to Kuala Lumpur is certain, as was confirmed by telegram in reply to your telegram which arrived 22nd April, 1971. I shall be starting from here 6:30 a.m., 30th April, 1971, arriving Kuala Lumpur airport by 2:30 p.m.

So far as a Trust Body for seeing to the correct publicity and distribution of my books, we shall discuss on this matter upon my arrival. It is also encouraging to note that one educated boy is wanting to translate some of our literature into Tamil language, so encourage him. Yes, when I come I shall bring slides, as there are many here.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am also in due receipt of your letter from Penang of 4/23/71.
