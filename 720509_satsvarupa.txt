====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

Dallas

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 4, 1972, and I have noted the contents. Your observations are nice, and I think this will be a nice way to arrange the world into zones for GBC management.

I shall be very happy to come to Dallas. We shall fix up some time after my coming to Los Angeles on the 18th of this month.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
