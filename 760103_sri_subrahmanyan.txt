Dear Sri Subrahmanyan,

Please accept my greetings and prayers for your well being. Thank you for your kind appreciation of our Society's activities and of my humble effort on behalf of Lord Krishna.

Regarding your request for some books, the best thing will be if you ask some able person to buy them for you. Or you may ask for the fare to come to Madras and live with the devotees of our Movement. The address in Madras is 50, Aspiran Gardens, 2nd Street, Kilpauk, Madras-10. If you live with our men following our program then you will also get opportunity to read all our books.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
