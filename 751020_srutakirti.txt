My dear Srutakirti dasa,

Please accept my blessings. After very long time I've received your letter and this has given me very much satisfaction. By Krishna's Grace you have now a lot of experience travelling with me and I hope it will be possible to manage the restaurant better and better. My blessings to your wife and child.

Another thing, out of 5,000 dollars I have received 4,000 dollars I think. One check which was sent to Paris I did not receive. It was informed to Paramahamsa at the time that I did not receive the check but I didn't know what happened next. Please let me know at the Bombay address.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
