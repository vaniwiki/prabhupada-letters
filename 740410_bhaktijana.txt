====== Letter to: Bhaktijana ======

New York

Dear Bhaktijana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 1, 1974.

Since you are facing so many difficulties alone in Harlem, New York City, I think it would be better if you return to Mayapur, under the direction of Bhavananda Maharaja and Jayapataka Maharaja, and I have no objection to your return there.

Now that the building there is complete, we are making it an ideal asrama. So if you go back there, you must find a suitable engagement. It is not a place simply for sleeping. If you think you can find suitable engagement there and stay always engaged either in chanting, reading, cleaning or some other work, then it will be nice. As far as funds for returning there, you will have to take collection there in New York. So I think this plan, as suggested by you, is best.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
