My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. Your letter has been forwarded to London, New York, and then to here. Regarding Sudama Vipra I have heard that he is in South America, but would like to have it confirmed so please write me in this regard. But you should stay there in Australia; it is not necessary for you to go to China.

Regarding reading Mahabharata, why divert your attention in this way? Bhagavatam is also Mahabharata. There are so many books I have presented already, so whatever you have got, just become expert in that. There are many things still yet to be learned.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
