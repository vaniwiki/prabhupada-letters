====== Letter to: Yadubara ======

Bombay

My dear Yadubara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 1, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Dai Nippon has upped their price for Hindi BTG considerably, so it is better to print in Bombay just as you have done with Gujarati BTG. When you return to Bombay, you can try for this. Meanwhile, the manuscript is lying with Dai Nippon for next Hindi BTG, so they have quoted nearly 20 cents per copy or more than 2 rupees, so I think that it will be better to send the manuscript to Bombay. I shall await your advice before deciding the matter.

You may develop the films of manuscripts from Birnagar and inform me what you have done and which manuscripts are with you, then I shall inform you where to send them for translating, etc.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
