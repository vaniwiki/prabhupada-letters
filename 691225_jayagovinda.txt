My dear Jaya Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated December 17, 1969, and I can understand from the spirit of your letter that Krishna is fixing you in a particular type of duty which you may welcome for your benefit, for the movement's benefit, and for the benefit of the people in general. Yes, you secure an IBM composer and utilize it fully. Let Mandali Bhadra translate our magazines and books, and in the IBM machine you compose it, ready for being photographed and printed. You send the ready matters to Boston, and they will print the magazine without any price from you. The cost of the printing will be balanced by keeping some magazines here for sale; so in that way your center will not have any botheration for paying the price. The balance magazines will be sent to you by ship, and you clear it, sell it, and pay for the monthly installments of the machine. This is the general arrangement I have thought about, without any monetary botheration for any of us. Simply we have to render service. Similarly, you invite such reading matters form Suridas in the French language. You compose it and send the matters for printing here, and in the same way things will be balanced, and the magazines in French language will be sent to Paris and they should partly pay for the IBM machine. I am sending a copy of this letter to Suridas, as well as to Brahmananda for future guidance, and you immediately begin the work. In the same way, if Mandali Bhadra can translate my books also, you can help the German composition and get the books in the same way. This is my theoretical proposition, and I am sure that if you follow, it will come to be fruitful.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
