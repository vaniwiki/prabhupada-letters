My dear Tulsi das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1975 and I have noted the contents with care.

I have marked how you are making mrdangas. Make many mrdangas. It will solve a great problem.

Concerning your idea to go port to port by ship, why waste time and energy. Don't spoil money purchasing boat. Port to port we can go by airplane.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Nb. On your recommendation, I am accepting the following devotees for initiation:
