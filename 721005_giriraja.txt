My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. Here is a copy of a letter received from Ambubhai & Diwanji that they are no longer acting as our attorneys. So please let me know who is acting as our attorney and what is the situation. Please reply to both Manila and Vrndavana addresses. Manila address is ISKCON Manila, 179 Ortega St., San Juan Rizl, Manila, Republic of the Philippines.

Hoping this meets you in good health

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Vrndavana address is Radha-Damodara Temple, Sevakunj, Vrndavana, Mathura (U.P.)
