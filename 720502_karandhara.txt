My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am just now in receipt of your special-delivery letters dated April 29, 1972, and I am very much encouraged by the contents. The newspaper article is especially nice, it means that the citizens are beginning to look behind our dress to find out our nice philosophy. This is a very good sign.

So far Madhudvisa is concerned, I am presently making a scheme for assigning GBC men to those new zones and for re-distributing the sannyasis, so do not encourage Madhudvisa to come there until I have decided where he shall go.

I am very much in favor of your plan to get that place in Laurel Canyon, so begin immediately. $150,000 is not so much for such a place, especially if we can get for low down-payment, then it is a very good scheme. So this place and the skyscraper, you try for both of them immediately.

I am also very much pleased to hear from you that you have sold 100 sets of paperback __Krishna Book__ in one day, and that you have re-ordered from Dai Nippon. Gradually, we shall replace the literatures which are currently popular with our own style of transcendental literature. I have tried it: any page you open, that is wonderful reading matter. My ambition is to spread these books far and wide all over the world so that everyone shall read at least one of our books and that will change his life. If only 1% become devotees, that will change the world. I think that eventually we can print TLC in paperback also.

In the skyscraper building, that can be a guest house for receiving tourists, so they can see how practical spiritual life is developing. If just 1% of these tourists become devotees, if they adopt this process, then our effort is successful.

So far moving the Press to Los Angeles, that is for you to consult with Bali Mardan. You are Book Trust now, you discuss with him and do the needful, that's all.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Initiation letter under separate post.\\
n.b. The idea is that all the devotees must attend arati, prasada, and other temple services. If they miss they will be deviated. So if they are living far away, like in Laurel Canyon, then another temple should be started. Unless there is arrangement for another temple, it will be not a nice proposal. Temple worship and prasada must be partaken, otherwise it will be ordinary residential quarters like karmis.\\
