My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 15, 1976.

I'm very glad to hear that Mr. Karsan and others are prepared to collect the entire amount for the house in Mombassa. I am enclosing a letter of encouragement for Mr. Karsan.

I like your idea for side by side arrangements to preach to the Africans and the Asians. Do it nicely, Krishna will give you all intelligence. I like the pictures you have %%__ __ __%% chanting. One may remain perpetually illiterate, but if one practices the devotional service activities, he will become a devotee. That's all, train them up to become devotees. How to play mrdanga, how to play karatalas, take prasadam, attend arati, etc. They'll never understand the books. They are less than sudras, candalas. Just train as Vaisnavas, then all education is there.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
