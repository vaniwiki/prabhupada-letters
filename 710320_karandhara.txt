My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13rd March, 1971, along with the invitation letters from the World Conference of Spiritual Enlightenment.

It is not a very important meeting, so you can send one Sankirtana Party there. You and Dayananda can speak something also. But by that time I may be in Los Angeles. Yes, the big Deities are already shipped to Los Angeles. We must have in L.A. immediately the installation of these big Deities. As soon as I arrive, I shall install Them.

Devananda has received the package with a charging cable and earphones for the Uher. Thank you very much for these. I am sorry to know that my old Uher was stolen from your office. You must always be very careful about such things. Anyway, another Uher was purchased and brought to me by Rsikumara Das. When I was in L.A. last time, I gave some instructions for the simple observation of the different kinds of holidays found in our Vaisnava calendar. Srimati Silavati had a copy at that time. So you may ask her to make a copy and send it to Srimate Maithili Dasi who has inquired how we are to observe these auspicious days in Krsna consciousness. We are now making the list of holidays for the new year of 485 Caitanya Era and when I return I can give some further hints how to observe them.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
