My dear Parvati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25 December 1976 and have noted the contents.

So, Brahmananda should be changed. Yes, I have received other reports. The GBC will change the situation. Someone of the GBC will come there and Brahmananda will be transferred to somewhere else. Perhaps he can go to Europe.

If Brahmananda also falls then of course there will be trouble there. What can be done?

As far as your own position is concerned, that can be definitely decided during the Mayapur festival. In the meantime you can remain in Kenya.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
