My dear Mahamsa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 23/12/76 and have noted the contents carefully.

Kindly make this farm project successful so that the majority of my time I can spend there. I like this place. You should work with full energy and endeavor to make this program successful. There will be no scarcity of financial help. Chant Hare Krishna and there will be good rainfall.

Your suggestion for paying back the loan is approved. You deposit in my account and whenever you require money I shall request the bank to transfer again. In this way keep regular accounts. Please find enclosed the original and duplicate copies of a letter of advice to the Punjab National Bank to transfer Rs. 46,500 into the Trust account. You may do the needful.

I am glad to hear that the sankirtana party is collecting nicely. That is very hopeful.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. What is the road like from Madras to Kodai Kanal. Is it a pakka road? Or is it not very good? Is it a winding and twisting road, going up into the mountains?\\
