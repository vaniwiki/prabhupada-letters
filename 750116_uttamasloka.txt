====== Letter to: Uttamasloka ======

Toronto

My dear Uttamasloka das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 31st, 1974 and have noted the contents. Yes. The way that you should make the altars is that there should be three separate rooms, doors, and altars. That will be very nice.

Thank you for your wonderful sankirtana results. It is very pleasing to me that you have sold so many books. Now, continue and increase.

I have accepted for 1st initiation the 6 persons you you have recommended. Their names are as follows: Earl---Harideva dasa, Geoff Meek---Govinda bhakta dasa, Lucien---Laksminatha dasa, Tim---Trilokanatha dasa, Tuija---Tribhuvanesvari dasi, Cathy---Ksiracora dasi. Their beads may be chanted on by Kirtanananda Svami. I have also accepted Purnamasi devi dasi and Rudrani devi dasi as my duly initiated (secondly) disciples. Their gayatri mantra sheet, are enclosed herein. Let them hear the gayatri mantra through the right ear from the tape of myself saying it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enc: 1 mantra sheet.
