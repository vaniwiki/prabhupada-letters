My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessing. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents carefully.

So far as shipment of the three sets of Murtis is concerned, you may ship as soon as possible one set to Boston and the other two sets may go to L.A. From L.A. one set can be sent to Montreal. So far as the marble Deities are concerned, one set may be sent to San Francisco and the other to Baltimore. I have also written to Jayapataka Maharaja about the building fund. Please consult him about this. Our Calcutta branch should be managed as follows: Jayapataka Maharaja - president; Acyutananda Maharaja - secretary and yourself as treasurer. So if the building fund is being nicely raised, that is all right and you may stay in Calcutta. If not, then when I go to Gorakhpur I shall call for you from there, but if fund raising\\
business is going on nicely, you can stay.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
