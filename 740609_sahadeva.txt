My dear Sahadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 13, 1974.

On your recommendation I have accepted the devotee submitted by you as my duly initiated disciple. His new spiritual name is as follows: Bruce Dickmeyer---Bhusaya dasa.

I understand this is the second time you are submitting the names of Siddhavidya and Kirticandra for second initiation and that you have seriously considered their eligibility for brahminical status. Therefore I will accept them as brahmanas, and the sanctified threads are enclosed as well as gayatri mantra. Have them listen to the tape of me chanting the mantra. The beads of the new initiates may be chanted on by Jagadisa Prabhu. I understand you are situated in a new building. You may send me pictures.

Now find enclosed a letter from a life member from Hyderabad, India. He writes that he is going to Houston, Texas for health treatment and he is asking that he and his wife and medical attendant be put up at the temple for room and board for one and a half months. I have written him that he may stay at our temple but I do not know if it is suitable for him. You can consider whether it is actually possible in your present circumstances to house a man and his wife as well as another companion. If the conditions are too crowded you may write to him and in any case let him know the actual situation in Houston. Let me know the further result of this.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
