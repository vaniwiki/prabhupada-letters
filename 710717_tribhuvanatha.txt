My dear Tribhuvanatha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear how successful our Rathayatra festival was, with nearly 10,000 people participating in the procession. And the police were very pleased with our cooperative spirit. Very good. I have received similar report from Nara Narayana Prabhu about the festival and I am so much appreciative to you all for your sincerely working to make this year's Rathayatra festival a grand success. Thank you very much.

I am also glad to note that a meeting of all the presidents was held just recently in order to unify the temples. That is the process. Unless we work cooperatively, how this movement will go on? So my request to you all is that you maintain that spirit of cooperation always and help me to deliver Lord Caitanya's message all over the globe.

You say in your letter that you have arranged a press conference for our arrival there in London on 1st August; I think Syamasundara Prabhu has written you that we are scheduled to be in N.Y. for one engagement on the 1st August. So keep the date for the press conference open and when the final date has been fixed up I will let you know. Probably it will be on the 2nd or 3d of August.

I have received the bead bag made by Malati, the karatala pouch made by Dinadyadri, the sweets and breads made by Mandakini, Aditi, Jill and Clare, the photos of the festival taken by Serge, and photos of the very beautiful paintings done by Vasudeva. All these presentations are so very nice. You are all so kind to me. Thank you very much.

Also one letter has come with the signatures of all the London devotees. Please offer them all my blessings. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
