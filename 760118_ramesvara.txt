My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your sending the monthly BBT newsletter. The results for December and for 1975 are wonderful.

In the material world competition one thinks my competitor can do so much, how can I bring him down? In the spiritual world there is appreciation: he has done so nicely, I could not do so well. Just like in the material world there is attraction between men and women and this attraction is stronger than anything else. In the spiritual world there is also beautiful men and beautiful women and there is attraction but this attraction is not so strong as the attraction for chanting the Lord's glories.

The results show that there is no limit to our book distribution. Our books are qualified to be distributed unlimitedly. We are not fiction writers. It is a fact that no expert booksalesmen can compete with our men. The Librarian has noted the difference between our men and other publisher's men. We are working for heart and soul, not for money. Such expert salesmen would have to be paid at least $1000 per month. That means if the had as many men as our Library Party they would have to pay at least $15,000 per month.

You are charging too much for the "Krishna Conscious Movement is Authorized". It should not cost the Temples more than 10 cents or whatever the cost price is. This is our advertisement and is meant for mass distribution. I have already suggested to you how to do this.

The Nectar of Instruction is also over-priced, in comparison with other books of its size. Print at least 100,000 and charge the appropriate price according to the other books.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

From the December ratings there appears over $800,000 was received. There should be $400,000 for construction.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
