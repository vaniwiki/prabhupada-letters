====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

Los Angeles

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your zonal report dated December 13, 1976 and have noted the contents carefully.

The parents' meeting in Detroit was very nice. It is a very good idea to organize a "Parents for Krishna" club. Try to do that. Regarding Chicago, why isn't the boy returned yet? He should be returned right away.

I will be going to the Kumbha Mela around the 10th or 12th of this month. I will stay as long as possible up to three weeks. then we'll be going to Mayapur until the festival.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
