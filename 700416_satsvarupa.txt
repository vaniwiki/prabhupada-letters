My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14th April, 1970, along with the transcription of tape #30 KRSNA. Thank you very much.

Regarding permission to marry Manmohini and Sridama, I have sent you one letter dated 11th April which I hope you have received by now. So in that letter I have already informed you that I have written to Sridama sanctioning his marriage and offering my blessings. I also enclosed one copy of procedure for the marriage ceremony to be performed by yourself in your temple. If you have still not received the letter and copy, ask Subala to send you one by air post. His instructions for performing the ceremony are personally approved by me.

Please offer my blessings to Srimati Jadurani and to all the other boys and girls there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. What has happened to the Caitanya Almanac which was to be printed? Brahmananda said it would be a little delayed, but I have not heard anything further is several weeks. Is it still being done? What is the situation?\\
P.P.S. My Dear Pradyumna, Please accept my blessings. I have just received KRSNA tape #30. Why are you still putting in "sannyasin" etc? I have written you that the "n"s should be left off e.g. "sannyasi," that is the first case ending should be used.\\
