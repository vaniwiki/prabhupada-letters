My dear Dinadayadri and Nara Narayana,

Please both of you accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your note dated 30 February, 1970, along with one check for $100 to my book fund account, and thank you very much.

I am very happy to learn that you are living and working together happily as Grhasthas. Now use this opportunity of household life, not for sense gratification, but for mutually working to perfect your Krishna Consciousness. I am also glad to note that you are eager to bring up many souls in Krishna Consciousness, and that is a very encouraging and responsible program. Just one good soul fully developed and firmly convinced in preaching Krishna Consciousness can reclaim so many fallen souls for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the best way to prepare such Krishna Conscious souls is to train them to up from their birth to follow the principles of Krishna Consciousness. This is possible by good association of devotee parents, so you must keep always fit in spiritual strength by following the regulative principles faithfully and chanting the sixteen rounds of beads daily without fail, then Krishna will give you more intelligence how to engage yourselves more and more in His service, and your lives will be sublime.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
