====== Letter to: Abhirama ======

Columbus, Ohio

My dear Abhirama Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents carefully. I am very anxious that Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's message be carried to South America also. Now we have got one center in Trinidad, started by Vaikunthanatha and his wife Saradia. That is a beginning. So your idea of having a large boat travelling from city to city is very encouraging. So if you have got the means, then go ahead and do it. Krishna Conscious men aboard ship and chanting Hare Krishna is very nice program and the coastal people may take advantage of this transcendental vibration and be benefited. So do it cooperatively with Hayagriva Prabhu and let me know of your progress.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
