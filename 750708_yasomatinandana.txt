My dear Yasomatinandanana das:

Please accept my blessings. I am enclosing some correspondence with Goswami Radheswaranand. There is one reply to him and also his latest letter.

So you go to Saurastra and see what is the possibility of opening centers there. I want that we should open up more centers in India. When I return to India I shall go there to Saurastra.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
