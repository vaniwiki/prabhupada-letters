====== Letter to: Sahadeva ======

Houston

My dear Sahadeva das adhikari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 1, 1975 and have noted the contents. What is the difficulty if you immediately start preaching in the colleges? At the present moment, Tamala Krishna Gosvami is looking for men who are interested in preaching at the colleges. Why not contact him and work together with him? That will be very nice. There is no necessity of your going to India. Better to begin preaching work immediately.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
