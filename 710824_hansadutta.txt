My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21st August, 1971 and have noted the contents. If I was misinformed, forget this incident and go on with your duty. Stress on Sankirtana performance and distribution of BTG. Our program is simple. You are a senior member of our society. So if you strictly follow our rules and regulations, chanting regularly 16 rounds, going for Sankirtana on the street and distributing prasadam automatically our movement will advance. So far work is concerned, when it is absolutely necessary it can be done. But as far as possible we should work in our own field and on the basis of our principles.

You are always saved and I am always pleased with your work but it is my duty to point out if there is any discrepancies.

I have received the German magazine and it appears very nice. Of course I could not read a single letter, but that doesn't matter. It was looking very nice.

Please offer my blessings to Himavati and the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
