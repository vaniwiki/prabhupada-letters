My dear Jagannatha Suta das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 15, 1975 with the enclosed copies of the latest issue of BTG No. 10. I can say that each issue you produce is an improvement on the previous one. This is very good. You are doing it enthusiastically. For the article of my touring they have selected the photos very nicely. We can talk with anyone. Marx. Darwin, all professors and politicians, we can challenge and defeat them. Our philosophy is so perfect. So go on exposing them, that is the purpose of Back to Godhead paper, to expose their materialistic ideas as all nonsense and present the real philosophy that Lord Krsna gives. This is the real knowledge.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
