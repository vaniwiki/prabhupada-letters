My dear Jayadvaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 31, 1972, along with the latest copy of Back To Godhead #49, which I have read carefully and have appreciated to my complete satisfaction. I am so glad to know that you and the others at ISKCON Press are doing so wonderfully service in this way. These books and magazines are doing so wonderfully service in this way. These books and magazines are our most important propaganda weapons to defeat the ignorance of maya's army, and the more we produce such literature and sell them profusely all over the world, the more we shall deliver the world from the suicide course. So your work is the most important preaching work, may Krishna bless you more and more. Thank you for helping me in this way.

Hoping this meets you and the others in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
