My dear Niranjana Das,

Please accept my blessings. I have duly received your letter to me dated 13 December, 1971. I am now in Bombay at the following address:

89, Warden Road,

"Akash Ganga" Building, 7th Floor,

Bombay-36.\\
I will be staying here for at least three more weeks. So as soon as possible you can immediately come to Bombay. I am very eager to see you and when you come I shall give you the second initiation.

In Delhi our program was very successful and at least 25,000 people attended each evening. The Governor, the Mayor, the Canadian High Commissioner and many other important persons were amongst our chief guests. And at the end of the program the Government has agreed to give us free land in Delhi on the Yamuna Rive bank for constructing a Temple. Then after the Delhi program our whole party went to Vrindaban for seeing all the important places. We were greeted very warmly by the citizens and they very much appreciated the purity and high standards which all our devotees maintain. I have always stressed this point; that if we simply follow the regulative principles, avoiding the four sinful activities, chant regularly daily 16 rounds, and maintain firm faith equally in Krishna and Spiritual Master, that your life will become sublime. So please come to Bombay and then we will talk further.

I hope you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
