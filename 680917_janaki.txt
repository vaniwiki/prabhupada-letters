My dear Janaki,

Please accept my blessings. With great pleasure I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13/9/68, and it is so nicely written that I have read the matter twice, I am writing herewith in my hand, Hare Krishna: Please try to open the London temple as quickly as possible, and I am ready to start for London at any moment on receipt of the news. You will be pleased to learn also that Sivananda is opening a center in Berlin very soon. His different letters indicate that he is very much hopeful for success of the center and two boys, one of them a German boy, Uttama Sloka, and Krishna das, are going to join him by the end of this month, of September. So I hope during the month of October we shall open two branches in Europe. Hope this will find you in good health,

[End of torn letter]
