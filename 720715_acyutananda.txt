My dear Acyutananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 7, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the songs by Jayadeva, "Srita Kamala" is not approved. Sometimes our Krsnadasa Babaji sings, but it is not approved by Prabhupada. Those songs are for __siddha bhaktas,__ not for us who are __sadha bhaktas__ or learning bhaktas. Lord Caitanya never divulged in public, he enjoyed them in the company of his selected three or four devotees. There is one song by Jayadeva, "Worshiping the Ten Incarnations," that song is all right.

The other songs that you mention are all right. Regarding the manuscripts, you may photograph all of the pages, then we shall type them later. If there is shortage of film, I have instructed Karandhara to send you a large supply of the appropriate films for photographing the pages. Or you may purchase there and we shall pay from Book Fund. These are important works and they must be preserved forever, so what is that expense?

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am not hearing about Mayapur. Please send me reports regularly what is happening there. Where is Tamala K. Goswami. I have not heard from him since longtime. Has he gone to Bangladesh yet? ACB
