Stockholm

Dear Krsna das,

Please accept my blessings. Here in India we require paper of the size of "Back to Godhead" magazine, and I wish to know if you can supply it from Stockholm. We would like to purchase first-quality paper, so please let me know the ways and means. Send paper samples and prices and also let me know how things are going on there. I have not received a report since Ajita sent one in January.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
