My dear Ramesvara das Maharaja and Ranadhira das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 19, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care. Firstly, there is no need to print the __Reservoir of Pleasure__ as if it were an excerpt from Dr. Judah's book. Furthermore, we can use some book review when it is favorable, otherwise reject it. Why should we print the __Reservoir of Pleasure__ as if it were Dr. Judah's writing? Furthermore, you should not distribute Dr. Judah's book. We should not distribute anyone else's book except our own.

So far the sign is concerned, why should we make such an expenditure of so many thousands of dollars for a sign . . . what benefit shall we derive? Whether it will be beneficial or not? Everyone knows that it is Hare Krishna Centre so why should you spend some thousands of dollars? One thing, however, I can suggest. If we display there a new picture or painting of our Hare Krishna Movement regularly, very nicely painted. Also, you can have a book display, with pictures and paintings also. That will be good advertisement.

In regards to the International Yoga and Meditation Conference in Chicago, there is no need for any of our men to participate. However, you can have a __Bhakti__-yoga bookstall, and paintings, a painting of Dhruva Maharaja as 5 years old alone in the forest. One painting of a devotee sitting in a nice place chanting japa Hare Krishna. We have got yoga meditation . . . and quote authoritatively giving evidence: Yoginam api sarvesam, etc [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]]. One who chants Hare Krishna is the topmost yogi. The highest perfection of yoga is Radharani . . . Krishna goes to Mathura and all night She is crying, "Where is My Krishna?" But what they can understand? So you can have a bookstall, and show paintings, like that.

I am going on to Auckland by the 26th April, then to Fiji for 28th April where we are laying the foundation stone for our new temple there. Afterwards, I shall go to Hawaii and then to Los Angeles at the end of May, or early June. I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Yasodanandana Swami wants to print the Brahma-Samhita with color paintings. The BBT Trustees can discuss amongst themselves and if they agree then I have no objection.\\
