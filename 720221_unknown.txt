There is a Bengali proverb "When you pay the price it becomes purified", just like if I purchase something and it is unclean in so many ways, but, because I have paid, it becomes purified.

I hope this will find you both in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
