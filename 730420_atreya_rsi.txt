My dear Atreya Rsi Das Adhikari:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 17, 1973 and have noted the contents. You have done right in seeing this man and speaking to him of our movement. . I think you have exposed him as a rascal and fool. What is this meditation of wine, women and fish? He does not like us because we reject all other bogus philosophy. For that many people criticize me, but why should we accept nonsense. We accept Bhagavad-gita, as Krishna spoke it.

Yes, you are right, he is third class man, so we should not waste time with him further. Stirring stools does not help. Anyway you have done right. The jackals may howl, but the caravan will pass on.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
