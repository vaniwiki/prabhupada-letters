My dear Hansadutta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated Jan. 11th, 1975 and have noted the contents. It is very encouraging. I pray to Krishna that everything may be settled up as described by you. I am going to Hawaii on Jan. 26th via Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. You can report the next incidences to Hawaii. The program is that from Hawaii I may go to Mexico and Caracas as invited by Hrdayananda Gosvami.

All money that is collected on behalf of the Food Relief program should be sent to India. (or if possible, send grains) Why has this not been done? That money (700,000 dm) that has been blocked up in the bank account there, as soon as it is freed, you should send whatever portion of it was collected on behalf of food distribution program to India. All money should be sent to Bank of America, International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Mayapur-Vrndavana Fund, account no. 16026 in Bombay.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
