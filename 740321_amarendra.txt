Dear Amarendra,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted the devotees recommended by you for first initiation, and their spiritual names are as follows:

Don Rousse---Dhanesvara das Adhikari

Lisa Ronss---Candrt devi dasi

Heidi Ranebhy---Nagari devi dasi\\
Their beads may be chanted on by Rupanuga Maharaja. You may hold a fire yajna and speak about avoiding the ten offenses in chanting. Please instruct these students in all ways so that they can advance nicely in your care in Krsna Consciousness.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
