My dear Goverdhan Das (G. Aram Hamamjian),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4 March, 1970, together with your beads for chanting Hare Krsna and your request to become my initiated disciple.

I am very glad to welcome you as my initiated student. I have duly chanted your beads and they are returned herewith. Please carefully observe the four restrictive principles; namely no taking of intoxicants, no eating of meat, fish, or eggs, no illicit sex-life, and no gambling. Chant regularly sixteen rounds of beads daily without fail avoiding the ten offences to the Holy Name of Krsna. This will make you intelligent to understand our philosophy, and you will automatically acquire all auspicious qualifications by always being engaged in devotional service of the Lord. So now chant Hare Krsna mantra and be happy. That is my desire.

I am enclosing herewith one sheet of standard practices for initiated devotees, for your reference, please find. I hope you will read our books attentively and you should ask guidance in understanding Krsna Consciousness from your elder God-brothers. If you stick to the principle of regularly chanting Hare Krsna and executing devotional service, Krsna will give you all protection in all circumstances of life.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
