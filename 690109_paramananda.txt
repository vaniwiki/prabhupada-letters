My dear Paramananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 4, 1969 along with your note for Purusottama who is here now and will give you his note along with this letter. I understand that you are anxious to go to New Vrindaban. I think that it is Krishna's will that you shall go there and try to develop that nice land because there is so much potential there which can utilize your abilities in being developed. I hope that by now you have received a note from Hayagriva who was staying with me for more than a fortnight. He is now married with Syama Dasi and he has returned back to New Vrindaban. If Kirtanananda Maharaja welcomes you during the winter months there is no need of waiting for the springtime. I have no objections. The only question is if there is sufficient place to accommodate you during the winter season. Also be sure to consult with Hansadutta to be sure that there will not be too great inconvenience in your leaving to New Vrindaban.

I thank you very much for your growing spirit of K.C. and I pray to Krishna for your future progress in life. Please convey my blessings to the other devotees there.
