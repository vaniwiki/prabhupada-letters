My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter of November 3, 1971. Yes, you may take the 32" brass deities, along with throne and paraphernalia on your tour of many states, and in this way try very nicely to reveal to everyone everywhere you go the ecstasy of __arcana__ worship.

I have answered your several letters, but somehow or other it appears they did not reach you.

I am very much pleased by this travelling Sankirtana program. Kindly execute it nicely, and sell as many books and magazines as possible, so that by reading Krishna philosophy, and by seeing you, they will become fully convinced.

Please keep me informed of your successes. Hoping this meets you in strong health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
