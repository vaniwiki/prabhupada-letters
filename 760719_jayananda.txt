My dear Jayananda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. For so long I have wanted to have Rathayatra in New York and now at long last you have helped me fulfill this long-cherished dream. The Ratha-carts were very strong and attractive and I thank you and all of your assistants for working so hard to prepare such nice carts. May Krishna bless you all for your sincere service that you may all go on making more and more advancement in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
