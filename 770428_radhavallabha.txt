My dear Radhavallabha,

Please accept my blessings.

As you probably know, our society is facing a very serious courtcase in Germany. It is understand that if we have difficulty in this courtcase, we may not get further chance to print our German books. Whatever German books you have lying with you ready for printing should be immediately printed. This work should be given priority as our society's well-being there depends upon it.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
