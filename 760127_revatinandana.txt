My dear Revatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 2nd January, 1976.

Where ever you deliver your lectures to students try to introduce at least our small books. If the students purchase these cheaper, smaller books, they will get a permanent impression of Krishna Consciousness. Especially present them __Easy Journey to Other Planets, Topmost Yoga, Beyond Birth and Death, Krishna Trilogy,__ and __Nectar of Instruction__---these are cheaper and they can purchase them and read them easily.

Yes, for returning to England you should consult Hansadutta.

When you come to Mayapur and Vrindaban you will very much appreciate how everything has developed since you were last there. There are also very nice accommodations for the devotees living.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
