My dear Vidarbha Kanya dasi

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 2nd 1974. In spiritual life it is very important to set a good example. The teachings of the param para are simply based on this principle of acarya. Sometimes the wife must bring the husband to Krishna Consciousness, so you yourself must chant 16 rounds and follow the devotional practices and reading my books. If it is difficult for you and you are falling down then it would be better for you to live in any one of our temples.

All of you are coming from backgrounds of bad habits, so to make progress in Krishna Consciousness we must overlook the faults of others. You must be patient with your husband. Chanting offenselessly is the remedy for all of these diseases. Therefore I have established that the duty of the president of each temple and also the GBC is to see that each devotee is following the rules and regulations, chanting 16 rounds so that they may be spiritually fit. So if you are having difficulty then it would be better for you not to live apart but to associate with other devotees.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
