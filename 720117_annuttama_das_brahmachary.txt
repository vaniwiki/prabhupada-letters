My dear Son,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Damodar I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual name of ANUTTAMA DAS.

I am so glad to learn that you have been such a great help to Damodar there in our Washington, D.C. center. I can understand that you are a very sincere boy and are a very eligible candidate for going back to Home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtan, etc. In this way keep yourself engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

I hope this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
