My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 13, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I think that if there is a chance for opening a center in Toronto, then Jagadisa and Kanupriya may go there as soon as possible. You have written that you would like Murari to go there, but he has already left for Boston, so if by mutual agreement you decide with Satsvarupa for him to go there, that is all right. Anyway, I have spoken to Satisuta today, and he has agreed to go there to help you in Buffalo within a fortnight.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Ernestine, and your very nice boy, Mr. Eric. I hope this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
