My dear Drstaketu das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter, with enclosed daksina, dated August 7, 1976. Whatever contribution you have, you may deposit in the Bank of America, Los Angeles Branch, a/c no. 6004-7143 (ISKCON Mayapur-Vrindaban Fund). Please also send me the deposit slip.
