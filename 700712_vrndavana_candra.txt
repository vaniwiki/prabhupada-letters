My dear Vrndavana Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 30th June, 1970, and noted the contents.

I am so pleased to learn that your center is attracting so many persons some of whom are sincere. If you are sincere in your service of preaching our Krsna consciousness philosophy, other sincere souls will come. Our process is for manufacturing sincere souls. How is it possible? Simply by your kindly following the rules and regulative principles and chanting the Holy Names offenselessly. This program is given by Lord Caitanya specifically to change the hearts of the fallen souls of this Kali Yuga for picking up their spiritual life.

I have received the set of japa beads sent by you. I have chanted them duly and they are sent back to you enclosed herewith.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
