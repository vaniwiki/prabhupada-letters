My Dear Kirtanananda, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12 April, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I have also seen the letter from Angelo, and I am sending it back to you because the handwriting is not clear for me to understand, and I think you can answer the questions anyway. Yes, I hope you will soon be getting a cow for New Vrindaban. Vrindaban without cows does not look well, so we must have many cows as soon as possible. Many devotees will be in New Vrindaban before very long, so this may be taken care of soon. For New Vrindaban, the principle of raising cows and raising foodstuffs must be very prominent.

I understand that Hayagriva was negotiating on some adjoining land of 150 acres and with two buildings, but I have not heard any recent reports on this. Please ask him to continue negotiation, and if the terms are fixed up, and I see the houses suitable, then we shall arrange to purchase. Please inform me how many mridungas are there. If there is not a sufficient number, then one or two may be purchased from New York center.

I hope this will meet you in good health. I have received one nice letter from Shama Dasi, so please convey my thanks to her for this.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enclosure: 2

P.S. I am going to Buffalo on Friday 18th.
