My dear Dr. Bali,

Please accept my blessings, and offer the same to your good wife Vijantimala. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th August, 1971 and have noted the contents.

So far going to Madras is concerned, the first thing is that we are now short of man power. Whatever men we have got in India are engaged in Calcutta, Bombay and Delhi. Still I am willing to go to South India provided you arrange for Azmaidan meeting.

Regarding purchasing your house, from your description it appears very nice house and the price offered by you may be acceptable, but we are collecting money locally for the local expenditures. So do you think if I go and attend the pandal festival Rs. 5 lacs can be raised? I do not know the price of the house, neither I know what funds will be raised in my presence but I can promise that whatever funds can be raised on that occasion I shall pay to you for your house and we can immediately start a center there. If you think it is feasible then I shall cancel my other programs in Africa and other parts of the world, then I shall go directly to India by the end of September or the first week of October as described by you.

Thanking you once more for your letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
