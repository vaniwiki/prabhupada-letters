My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I hope you have already received my yesterday letter with enclosure of certificate of photostatted copies. The original copies are lying in my room; they could not bring them, but if you think that the same certificates will serve our purpose, and the original are needful, then I will arrange to send them somehow or other. But you must ascertain whether that certificate will serve the purpose. I am a bona fide preacher in the line of Lord Caitanya. There is no doubt about it. That is practically proved. The certificates are also there. I am very much anxious to know if this will serve your purposes and a reply by return post will give me great relief. The idea is that if I get that permanent visa, then I shall settle things up in that way. I do not mind whether I am in the U.S.A. or Vrndavana, because my life and soul is to preach Krishna Consciousness; but if you think those certificates are not sufficient for my permanent visa after consulting gentlemen like Mr. Dhar or others whom you are consulting, then I shall think of going back to India. But if I get the permanent visa,, even in my broken health I shall stay in U.S.A. and try to propagate my mission through my disciples like you, Hayagriva, Kirtanananda, and others. I don't mind whether I die here or in Vrndavana---wherever there is Krishna, that is Vrndavana. So I shall be glad to hear from you the clear position about this. That will give me relief and new energy.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
