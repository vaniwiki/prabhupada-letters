My dear Kirtiraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 3rd January, 1976, giving a report of your preaching in Poland. I also received your letter dated December 7th, 1975 and replied it.

Yes, you should get my books translated into Polish. Wherever our books are being distributed, our movement is established on a firm basis. Therefore I came to your country with books. So try to get the books translated.

You ask what you should do about your wife and child. What can I advise if your wife doesn't want to take inconvenience. Preaching means some inconvenience. There is no reason why you have to be settled in one place. The actual education of a child doesn't begin until five years. Before that the child is free. Thereafter, the child may be sent to Gurukula in Dallas. This is the Vedic system.

The most important aspect of our preaching is Kirtana. Induce the people to chant, that is the only thing. Then everything else will follow. The goal is to make devotees and books; both are required. Distributing the books will make devotees. To make a devotee means to make someone purified. Reading the books will purify the intelligence. A purified heart and mind means Krishna Consciousness.

Don't try to become big very fast. That is not possible. Go slowly.

My advise is that you and your wife should preach together. But your wife doesn't like this so what can I do?

Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
