Dear T. B. Randler,

Please accept my best wishes. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December, 1975.

From your letter I can understand that for the time being you are not fixed up. I shall most probably be coming to the U.S. in May, so try to see me at that time and we shall talk about all your points. In the meantime go on chanting Hare Krishna and reading Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
