My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 30th September, 1973, and I have noted the contents.

Regarding printing BTG locally in England rather than taking from Los Angeles, you are right, you should not print it in London for the time being. Syamasundara is always utopian. This idea of his is not possible.

I am very encouraged by the report of how nicely our books are being distributed. This is our main business all over the world. If you give full attention to this, there will never be any shortage of funds. So I am very glad to note that in London now this programme is becoming well established.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
