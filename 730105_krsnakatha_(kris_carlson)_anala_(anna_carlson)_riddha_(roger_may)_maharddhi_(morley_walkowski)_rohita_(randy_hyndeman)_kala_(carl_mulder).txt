My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Bahudak I have gladly accepted all of you as my duly initiated disciples. You may send your beads to Kirtanananda in New Vrindaban for chanting on them on my behalf. There is no difference if I chant them or he chants them, I have authorized him in that way. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Kris Carlson/ KRSNAKATHA DAS ADHIKARI

Anna Carlson/ ANALA DEVI DASI

Roger May/ RIDDHA DAS

Morley Walkowski/ MAHARDDHI DAS

Randy Hyndeman/ ROHITA DAS

Carl Mulder/ KALA DAS

Now my request to all of you is that you very seriously and sincerely stick to the principles of devotional service, and especially observe strictly the four prohibitions, and without fail always chant at least 16 rounds on your beads daily. In this way you will be always happy.

You have now got the golden opportunity of this human form of life, and it is not by accident that you have met your spiritual master, so if you are actually intelligent you will take advantage of Krsna's blessings upon you and go back to home, back to Godhead. The essential point to remember is that by your activity you will please always your spiritual master. That means following the orders and instructions of your spiritual master, and my first instruction to all of my disciples is that they become Krsna conscious devotees themselves and help others to become devotees by spreading this Krsna Consciousness movement all over the world, utilizing their energy however they are best able to do it. In this way, if you keep yourselves always engaged in Krsna's business 24 hours, then you will be freed from all attachment to maya, by Krsna's grace. Just as when the darkness and the light come together, the darkness cannot stand before the light, so maya cannot remain in the presence of Krsna. Always remember therefore to chant Hare Krsna, and that will save you in all circumstances, without any doubt.

Hoping this meets you all in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
