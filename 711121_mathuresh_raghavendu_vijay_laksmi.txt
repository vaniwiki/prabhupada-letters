My dear Sons and Daughter,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Satsvarupa I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted on by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given all of you the spiritual names as follows:

__Andrew Day__

Mathuresh das (The Lord of Mathura)

__Martin Lewis__

Raghavendu das (The moon in the Raghu dynasty)

__Jill Lewis__

Vijay Laksmi dasi (The Queen of victory)

I am so glad to learn that you have been such a great help to Satsvarupa there in our Boston centre. I can understand that all of you are very sincere and are very eligible candidates for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you all will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
