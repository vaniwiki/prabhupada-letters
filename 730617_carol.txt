My dear Carol,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 7, 1973 and I have carefully noted the contents.

I can see from your letter that you are very sincere about Krsna Consciousness and Gurukula. Yes, you should always feel yourself most fortunate and glad that you are in the Krsna Consciousness movement where you can learn sanskrit and English from such nice Krsna Conscious teachers as Dayananda and Dinatarine, and not be learning-as in the public schools-how to cheat and eat meat etc. Please stick to this conviction of yours and more and more your natural Krsna Consciousness will develop. I have seen your writing of the sanskrit letters and it is very nice.

Your ever well-wisher

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
