My dear Rupanuga Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 12, 1974 (sic) and have noted the contents. We do not allow divorce, but in your country it is a common thing. Although we do not like it, according to the country, what can be done? There is a Sanskrit saying, Do according to the country's laws. If both the present husband and wife agree to divorce, then they can do it and re-marry, what can be done?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
