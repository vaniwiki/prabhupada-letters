My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. As there are so many engagements in L.A. and in S.F. now I fix up my program as follows: The meeting in City College instead of on the 8th, Tuesday, push it to the 10th, Thursday, and up to the 15th or 16th of April you can make other engagements if possible. On the 18th Rupanuga wants me there in Buffalo. He wants to stay me there until the 23rd, then I shall go to Boston. Then if necessary I may come back to New York from New Vrindaban, or we shall talk when we meet. In the meantime I have received one letter from Subala, in which it is stated that on receipt of the final press proof of BTG from Dai Nippon we shall have to arrange for a letter of credit. But this arrangement is not very palatable to me, because in the last transaction, TLC, we arranged for the credit note at the cost of about $200. In this way they charged $25, for transferring the money to Japan, and they might have charged again such $25, I do not know. And on $6000, with 5% interest for 4 months, it comes to $100. So in total we have lost nearly $200. So this letter of credit is not possible. But one thing can be done, that on receipt of the press proof, you can pay your share, nearly $750, and the balance that is $1350 will be paid on delivery of shipping documents. That I shall arrange.

I shall be looking forward to seeing you all on the 9th of April, and hope you are all well and happy.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
