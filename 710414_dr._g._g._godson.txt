My dear Dr. Godson,

Please accept my blessings. Yes, you are certainly welcome to come and live with us and try to understand our philosophy. If a personality like you will join this institution, it will be a great asset. So for the present I am here in Bombay at the following address: Akash-Ganga Bldg. 7th floor; 89 Warden Road; Bombay-26. If you will kindly see me any day between 9-10 a.m. or 4-5 p.m. and we shall discuss on this matter further.

Presently arrangements are being made for me to go to Moscow, Russia. We have one invitation to speak in the university there. If I see that you are understanding our philosophy, then I shall be glad to take you with me to Russia for preaching work.

Hoping to see you soon.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
