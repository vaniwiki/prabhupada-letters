My dear Arundhati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of dated January 22, 1969, and I am pleased to send herewith your beads duly chanted upon by me. Your spiritual name is Arundhati which means the great star. It is the name of the wife of Vasistha, a great devotee of Krishna.

I am very pleased to know that you are taking a very sincere interest in perfecting your life in Krishna Consciousness. You are fortunate to have the association of your godsister, Jadurani, and I am sure that she, along with the other devotees in the Boston temple will be able to help you in many ways. Be sure to chant your sixteen rounds daily and read one chapter of Bhagavad-gita As It Is, one chapter daily. Follow the four regulative principles strictly, and I am sure that Krishna will see that your life quickly becomes more and more happy in devotional service. The attitude which you expressed is very nice, and please continue to develop this attitude always.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
