My dear Rupanuga das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 22, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding Sankirtana and book distribution, book distribution is also chanting. Anyone who reads the books that is also chanting and hearing. Why distinguish between chanting and book distribution? These books I have recorded and chanted, and they are transcribed. It is spoken kirtanas. So book distribution is also chanting. These are not ordinary books. It is recorded chanting. Anyone who reads, he is hearing. Book distribution must not be neglected. If things deteriorate that is another thing, but it is not the fault of book distribution.

In Gainesville the students can live with us, why not? Anyone who agrees to follow our rules and regulations can be admitted.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
