My dear Sri P.S. Garg,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 6th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I thank you for your concern for my disciples' health. Actually, they are getting ghee and other milk products daily along with capatis, dhal, and rice. They are also taking fruits and vegetables daily. Some of them are getting very fatty. Any way the food is there, if they are getting skinny and thin, it might be some other cause.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
