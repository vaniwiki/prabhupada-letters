His Divine Grace Lalita Prasad Thakura\\
Bhaktivinode Institute\\
Ulla-Birnagar, Nadia dist., W. Bengal

My dear Uncle Prabhupada Lalita Prasad Thakura,

Kindly accept my humble obeisances at your Lotus Feet. The whole day spent at your Temple on Thursday was so pleasant, and happy that all my disciples felt celestial blessings in your association. Personally, I am so much encouraged by you, that I appreciate this as the blessings of Bhaktivinode Thakura through his living representative.

Now you can expedite the lease agreement immediately so that before returning to U.S.A. in about three weeks' time I may advise my assistants to take up the work seriously and begin construction and other things.

Next time when I go to you I shall stay not less than one week.

Hoping this will meet you in the very best health and happy mood.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
