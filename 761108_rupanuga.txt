My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 28, 1976.

Yes, we should take advantage of this opportunity to preach. I see it that somehow or other they are chanting Krsna. Either they criticize or chant. The article you have sent from the college newspaper can help our counter-propaganda. Ramesvara should be informed.

This incident with the president of our Washington temple is not good. He can't even maintain one wife. Just see how lusty he is. Now he'll dare to take another. Anyway he cannot live in the temple. If he wants two wives it must be done outside. He should maintain his family by working and give 50% to the temple. He may not live off temple funds. Temple president is generally meant for sannyasi, but a grhastha may be if he is restrained. It is not good if he remains as president.

Our place there is very nice, now develop it. It is nice if you can begin Bhaktivedanta Institute there.

You have mentioned that they are looking at a new building in St. Louis, a church, that's nice. It is very good that there are now 55 devotees at our Montreal temple. It is a big temple, a good place.

Regarding our men becoming lawyers, yes do it. For a graduate it is not difficult. You can also take a degree. However, five years is too long for our men to work as a clerk. That is not good.

Hoping this will meet you in good health. Your son has arrived here. I am happy to see him.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
