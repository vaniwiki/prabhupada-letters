Hrdayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated nil accompanied by two copies of the first edition of the Portuguese Bhagavad-gita. It is very nice.

You are doing very nicely. This enthusiasm is required. It is the basic principle in making advancement in Krsna's service. You have written to say you want to start printing Caitanya Caritamrta. I think it is too difficult. It is better for the time being to simply continue with the Bhagavatam. Caitanya Caritamrta is the post-graduate study.

You have written that chanting, dancing and book distribution are going on nicely. Prasadam distribution should also be introduced. This will make the program even more effective. I am glad to know that Pancadravida is doing so nicely. He is a very good assistant.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
