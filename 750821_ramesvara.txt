My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 12, 1975 and have noted the contents. Yes, when Krsna was present, the religious principles were going on nicely, but when He retired back to His abode, then deterioration infiltrated. But Srimad-Bhagavatam is the sunshine Purana by Vyasadeva to open the eyes of the conditioned souls. It is the sound representation of Lord Krsna.

Regarding your desire for all twelve cantos, you will get it, rest assured. Your so much ardent desire will be fulfilled by Krsna.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
