====== Letter to: Ambarisa ======

Boston

My dear Ambarisa das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 2, 1976 and have noted the contents with pleasure. Your idea of opening up an account, depositing in it, and sending me the monthly statements is very nice. I approve of your idea cent per cent. You have voluntarily put yourself under my control. Thank you very much.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
