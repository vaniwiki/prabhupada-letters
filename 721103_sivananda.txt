Berlin

My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 20, 1972, from Berlin, and I have noted the contents with care. I am very glad to hear from you that Berlin centre is progressing nicely under your expert supervision. You are one of my older disciples and I think you were the first devotee in European continent, so now you have got good experience how to do the things well, and I see that you are sincerely applying your knowledge to expand Krishna Consciousness movement with good result. That is very much appreciated by me. Now go on in this way, distributing books profusely and preaching and making devotees, and that activity will be the perfection of your life.

Upon your recommendation I am very glad to initiate the two German boys with first initiation, and their letter is enclosed herewith.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
