My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you so much for your letter of January 30, 1969. I am glad to know that you are anxious to begin tending the Deities in grand style and fashion. Before I instruct you further in this matter, please send me a detailed list of what worshiping methods you are now performing. Let me know how you are conducting temple worship now from morning till night. I hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
