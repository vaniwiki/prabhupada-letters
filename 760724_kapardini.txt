Dear Kapardini dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very nice gift. I thank you very much for it and hope that you and your son Gaurahari das are advancing very nicely in your Krsna consciousness. Please always follow the regulative principles and chant your rounds carefully and surely such sincere practice will lead you to success. Pleasing the spiritual master is the active principle in spiritual life and offerings made with love and devotion are always pleasing to the spiritual master. Please continue in this way.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
