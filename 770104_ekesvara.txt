My dear Ekesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents.

So, revive rigidly the devotional practices and be repentant. Then Krsna may be pleased to excuse you. You must be repentant.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
