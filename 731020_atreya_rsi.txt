====== Letter to: Atreya Rsi ======

Tehran

My dear Atreya Rsi Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 3, 1973 and the nice offering made by Navayauvana dasa, and I thank you very much. . You say that you are doing limitedly, but go on. Try to convince the elite section about our Krsna consciousness movement. You have got a very nice place there with attached garden, and you are able, so just depend upon Krsna. Simply we have to desire to please Him, and not desire anything for ourselves. Then we become simply instruments for His will. This is the important essence of Krsna consciousness.

You will be pleased to know that here in Bombay we have now secured the Juhu land from Mrs. Nair. It is a great relief that after such a long struggle, we can now do something very wonderful for Krsna. This land has very good potential, so now let us utilize it it in Krsna's service.

My itinerary is to start for Vrindaban within several days, then go to Delhi for a pandal they are arranging. On November 20 I shall go to Nairobi, then to South Africa until mid December, when I shall start for Australia.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
