====== Letter to: Aksayananda ======

Vrindaban

My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 2, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

I am very pleased to hear that Haihaya is doing nicely as manager. He is a good boy. Now train him to be first class manager. You mention attracting more people to stay in our guest house . . . yes, but when will that attraction be made? First attraction is to clear all children out of the guesthouse, otherwise no one will come. It is very much botheration.

I had written to you about sending dimensions of the altar and vyasasana, etc. to Fiji where we are presently constructing the Krsna-Kaliya temple, but I have received word from Fiji that as yet they have not received this information from you. Please try to do the needful as they are nearly ready to begin work on that portion of the temple.

Concerning the 4 men who were supposed to have come to New Vrindaban for constructing purposes, Kirtanananda Swami will correspond with you directly in the event the need may arise.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. also send photos of the altars and Vyasasana to Fiji as they will need these for making the designs.
