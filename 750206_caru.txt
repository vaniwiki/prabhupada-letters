====== Letter to: Caru ======

Albert Park, Australia

My dear Caru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. From your letter, it appears that you need a change of activities. I think it will be best if you come to the festival at Mayapur and from there we can decide what project will be best for you to become involved in. For the time being, keep yourself fixed in Krishna's service 24 hours and follow staunchly all of the regulated principles, such as chanting 16 rounds, rising early, attending arati and class, etc.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
