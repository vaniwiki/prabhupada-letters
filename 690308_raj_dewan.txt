I am so pleased to receive your letter dated Feb. 20th, 1969, Swami B. D. Madhava of Sri Caitanya Gaudiya Math has kindly requested you to contact me so I am so much thankful to both of you. He is my God-brother. The books mentioned by you can exactly be had from Gaudiya Math, Kali Prasad Cakravarti Lane, Bagh Bazar, Calcutta-3, India. Some of the books mentioned by you are sometimes imported by my New York center, and the manager in charge is Sriman Brahmananda Brahmacari, ISKCON Temple, 61 Second Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10003.
