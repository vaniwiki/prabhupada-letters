Sri Vishvambhar Dayala\\
c/o Krishna Balarama Temple,\\
Raman Reti, Vrindaban, (U.P.)

My dear Vishvambhar Dayala,

Please accept my blessings. I understand that Sri Bhawatyaji has come to Vrindaban for transferring land for Gurukula. I hope by the time this letter reaches you, you will have finished the transaction.

The other day Goswami Nrsimhavallabha's son did not come to see me, so kindly finally once more approach the Goswami and let me know if he is at all interested to take up the translation work as he has informed me that he has already translated a part of the book which I gave him. Then immediately send the translation work to me in Bombay or you can read it yourself, compare with the original book and if possible re-write or copy and send it to me at the Bombay address. On hearing from you finally about this matter I shall decide to appoint one translator either in Delhi or Bombay. Please take it as very important and do the needful.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
