My dear Krsna das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 30 from San Francisco.

It is pleasing to me to here you are happily engaged in devotional service and living as an ideal grhastha. Please go on as you are doing: keep your business separate and wherever you remain keep your family in Krsna Consciousness always chanting Hare Krsna and observing the regulative principles. Cultivate your business for Krsna, remain happy in Krsna Consciousness and always serve Krsna.

Your name is already Krsna das so your new boy may be given the name Krsna das-anudas, the servant of the servant of Krsna [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|(Cc. Madhya 13.80)]]. This was the position desirable to Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
