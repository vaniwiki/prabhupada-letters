My dear Mahatma Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated with the enclosed sankirtana report. I thank you very much for the good news. The enthusiasm of the devotees is a very good sign. The more they become enthused and anxious to preach the more they become Krishna conscious. __ya idam paramam guhyam mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati, na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah__ ([[books:bg:18:68|Bg. 18.68]] and [[books:bg:18:69|18.69]]). One who explains the supreme secret to the devotees is the most dear to Krsna and never will there be one more dear. So always keep them enthused in this book distribution. This pleases me very much.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
