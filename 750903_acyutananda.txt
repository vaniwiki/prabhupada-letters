My dear Acyutananda Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 30, 1975 with enclosed clippings. They are very nice. You have done nicely. If you can get money, I have no objection to your getting a bus.

Regarding your question, Sukdev and Vilvamangal Thakura developed the conjugal ecstacies later on.

Regarding your difficulty in rendering Caitanya Bhagavata, yes you are right that you are overstepping your position. Better to stop it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
