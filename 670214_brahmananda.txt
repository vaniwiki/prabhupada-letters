My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept blessings and offer the same to all your Godbrothers and sisters. With reference to your telephonic conversation last night and your letter of the 10th February, I beg to inform you that the Branch at San Francisco will act as a separate identity and the New York establishment has nothing to take risk for this centre.

I have also received the letter of Mr. Altman and I shall act according to his desire. So you can transfer $200.00 for Altman and $6000.00 altogether $6200.00 to my savings account No. 19282 at the Trade Bank And Trust Company and letter of transfer is enclosed herewith. I have duly signed the letter and you also sign it and forward it to the Bank. They will do the needful. This $6000.00 will be transferred forth with by me as soon as there is a __Sale contract__ for purchase of the house. Till then it will remain in my Savings Account.

When actually there is Sale contract signed I shall induce the San Francisco Branch to contribute $1000.00 positively rest assured.

In the opinion of the devotees and trustees here $1000.00 dollar has been risked without any understanding. I know that you are doing your best but still there has been an error of judgment. I am not at all displeased with you but they say that Mr. Payne will never be able to secure financial help from any other source. He is simply taking time under different pretext changing constantly. Therefore you should not pay even a farthing more than what you have paid. If he wants any more money you should flatly refuse.

Kirtanananda's presence in New York is essential; therefore I have postponed his journey to Montreal. Advice of friends here has been accepted by me that opening of too many branches at the present stage will be too heavy for us. Let us consolidate there in two places which we have already opened. Besides that the Montreal Branch wants men and Money which we cannot spare at the present moment.

Your note on the dictaphone is taken care of. It is sent for adjustment because there is some defect in the machine. In the meantime they have supplied a machine for my work. I have now five tapes only. Three more required. Neal has not come here. Chant Hare Krishna be jolly. We are all secured by Krishna rest assured.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
