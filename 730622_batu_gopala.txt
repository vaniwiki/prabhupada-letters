My dear Batua Gopala,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15 June 1973 and I have carefully noted the contents.

Yes, it is pleasing and encouraging to me to hear how all your programs, book distributing, temple worship etc., are going on so nicely in our Cleveland Center. That you have distributed 10,000 pieces of literature in the last month is very impressive. It will take some time to convince the people of this highest philosophy and the only means to convince them is distribute our books profusely. By chanting Hare Krsna their rough hearts will be paved. And when we speak about Krsna it will be shown exactly like the cultivator who first of all paves the field and then the seeds are sewn and gradually they get the result.

On your recommendation I have accepted the four students in your temple as my disciples. Their new names are as follows:

Marilee Ash---Mrgaksi dasi

Harvey Mechanic---Mrgendra das

Dan Cunningham---Gatravan das

George Vutetakis---Gopati das

Have them send their beads to Kirtanananda Swami for chanting. You can hold a fire yajna for the initiates and invite many guests. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
