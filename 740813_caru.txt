My dear Caru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 17th. I am forwarding your letter to Madhudvisa Swami for necessary action. The idea is very good. You do it as you see fit. Hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
