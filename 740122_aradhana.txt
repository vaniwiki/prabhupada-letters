Dear Aradhana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated January 13, 1974.

I can understand that you are feeling disturbed because your wife has left you, and also that you are not living within the association of devotees at our Paris temple. My advice to you is that you associate always with Krsna through chanting the Holy Name. If you are always with Krsna there is no question of moroseness or anxiety. Further than this, Krsna will give you intelligence through sincere chanting, how to progress further in Krsna Consciousness. It is a fact, however, that to be happy and peaceful in spiritual life, the association of devotees is essential.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
