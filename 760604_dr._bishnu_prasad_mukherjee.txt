Dear Dr. Mukherjee,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 27, 1976, with enclosed brochure, and I have noted the contents carefully.

Our Krishna Consciousness Movement is not a Bharatiya artistic one. It is a program to solve all the problems of all the world. We are getting good response, so your cooperation will be welcome, but we are not interested in Bharatiya as there are already so many organizations of this nature. Our workers are all dedicated souls and they are engaging in activities on the spiritual platform. If sometimes you could find the time, perhaps we could meet together and we can talk.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
