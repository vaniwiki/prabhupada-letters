My dear Tejiyas:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 12th and have examined it with great pleasure.

This program of approaching MPs is very very important. If you can get this petition approved, that would be a great boon to our movement. Even if 15 or 20 MPs join our Society that will be a new chapter for us. And your petition is very attractively worded. Actually India is the spiritual leader of the world but the fools and rascals are trying to sabotage the position.

Your school preaching is very much welcomed by me. We are in need of new recruits to carry out so many ambitious programs here in India, so if you can infiltrate the school system as you did in America that will be a great service.

Yes, this program for the factories I have already outlined. Let the labor-management disputes be finished by prasada and regular kirtanas with temples right on the premises.

Your statement that "no intelligent man can resist becoming the member" because of our books is a very good observation. Now these beautiful books have become the firm basis for our movement and any intelligent person in any part of the world cannot but fail to admire them.

Devotees there or visiting must follow our regulated principles under your direction or they need not stay. Devotees should not be in India on their own business or on a whim, they should have our GBC approval. Everyone must be favorably engaged.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
