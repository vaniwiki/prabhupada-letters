Sriman Ram Prashad Dasa\\
2582 Sector 22-C\\
Chandigarh, INDIA

My dear Sriman Ram Prashad Dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 1, 1972, and I have noted the contents. We have introduced a Life Membership program there in India, for the purpose of giving the intelligent men in the society an opportunity to help push on this great movement of pure Vedic culture. Our members receive all our books printed to date - Bhagavad-gita (in 1000 page edition), Caitanya-caritamrta, Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Sri Isopanisad, Srimad-Bhagavatam (to be completed in 60 volumes), and other books totalling about 20. They also receive any book which will be printed in the future, as well as a lifetime subscription to Back to Godhead magazine. Any of our life members and their immediate families are permitted to stay in any of our 100 temples anywhere in the world, free of charge, for as long as they like. So my suggestion to you is that you communicate with Sriman Giriraja dasa Brahmacari, the president of our Bombay headquarters, and he will give you more information regarding this membership program. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
