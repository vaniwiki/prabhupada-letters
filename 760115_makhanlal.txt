My dear Makhanlal,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated January 1st, 1976.

I accept all the new devotees as my initiated disciples. Their names are:

Glenn Wharton---Isvaripati dasa

Andy De Souza---Sarvadevamaya dasa

Thomas Wyhaupt---Guruvagmi

Harry Troy---Vedatma dasa

Now you must hold a fire ceremony. Everyone must agree to chant daily minimum of 16 rounds and follow strictly the rules and regulations. I also accept Gopta Das for second initiation. I have enclosed his sacred thread duly chanted on. After the fire ceremony he should hear the Gayatri mantra through the right ear from the tape. Brahmin means to be very clean, inside by chanting the Lord's glories and externally by regular bathing. Teach him these things by your personal example.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
