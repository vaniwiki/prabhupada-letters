My dear Jayatirtha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 26, 1975. I want that the GBC relieve me of all management which means they have to manage the way I manage. I do not want to see things deteriorate by their management.

I have read the article of Transcendental Meditation. From this study I understand that it is not seriously taken. Therefore it means that this Transcendental Meditation, so-called, will not stay.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
