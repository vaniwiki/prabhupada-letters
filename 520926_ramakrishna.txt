My dear Ramakrishna,

In reply to Srimati Suluxmona's letter, I am sending herewith one letter for her which may be delivered to her. I came here to improve my lot but I see that my bad luck is impossible to be improved. For the last two years approximately I have met expenses from this business to the extent of Rs 600/- month. Calcutta, Allahabad, Ranchi High-Court & Ry Journey altogether five different items of expenses have been so far met. But all of a sudden my sister opponent firms have designed to remove me from this place. By their trick the Drug Controller has suspended my business for the last one and a half month with the result that about Rs 1000/- has been locked up & sealed and I have been put to shame by my servants. I require immediately Rs 300/- to meet the establishment charges without which I am much humiliated.

I am trying my level best to reopen the business but still it will take minimum one week to come to the normal condition. I am awfully stranded and put to much shame. Will you kindly help me as you have done so many times? As a son has no shame to ask his father, so I feel no shame for it because there is no other help at the present moment. __If you can, please do send me T.M.O. for Rs 300/- & save my prestige & honour.__ I expect to return you this sum after a fort night. As soon as my business is opened I shall at once get back Rs 1000/-. May God bless you.

Yours affectionately\\
Father-in-law.\\
__N.B.__ I shall expect your T.M.O. by Monday next or latest Tuesday next.\\
ACD
