Dear Tirthaji,

Your letter dated 6th March, 1971, in hand.

I understand that the Birla Guest House along with other guest houses has been already booked and occupied by pilgrims and guests. I informed you to go there more than one week before they were supposed to be occupied and still it was physically impossible to arrange any accommodation for my party although they have come from Europe and America, some thousands of miles away.

Anyway, I shall be pleased to know when they shall be vacant. I wish to go there with my party and stay there for a few days. Kindly let me know when I can occupy the Birla Guest House.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
