London

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have just made arrangements for marble Deities to be made for our centers. They will be manufactured just to the standard of our London Deities. I have opened negotiations with one Jaipur Murti maker, and in this connection he has requested a photograph accurate for his manufacturing purpose.

So please send a full size photograph without any dress up to:

Sri Surajnarain Natha

Mool Chand Ram Chand Natha

Marble Quarries, Factory Owners and Contractors

Khazanewalon Ka Rasta

Jaipur-1, (Rajasthan)

India\\
Please take this photograph of the Deities without Their clothes on and send it immediately by airmail to the manufacturers. Please treat this matter as urgent. Thank you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. You can send the negatives and one print here to me also.
