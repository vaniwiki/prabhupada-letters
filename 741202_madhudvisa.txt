====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

Melbourne

My dear Madhudvisa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 5, 1974 with enclosed plans of the newly purchased house. It all appears very wonderful. It is very good that the Deity is facing East. Yes, the room above the Deity should be kept vacant. Yes, you can store Ratha Yatra festival gear or books there, also. The proposed pinnacle should not have Om, but shastic or cakra, Krsna's weapon.

So everything is nice, and I shall be glad to come for the Deity installation and temple opening in January. We shall come from Honolulu via Fiji.

I Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
