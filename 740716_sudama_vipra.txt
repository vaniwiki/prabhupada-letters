My dear Sudama Vipra Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. So I am here in Los Angeles, from tomorrow I am going to Dallas, from there to New Vrindaban, and then to London on my way to India. I am reaching India by July 26th to arrange for our grand festival in Vrindaban. I cordially invite you to attend our opening ceremony in Vrindaban because all our sannyasis will be present there. You also come there as a regular sannyasi and take part. That is my desire.

Yes, it will be very nice if the Chinese boys come there to the Hong Kong center. That is our mission that the local boys take up interest in our movement.

While I was in Melbourne Tusta Krsna along with other friends met me there and took part in the Ratha yatra festival. He was so kind to pay me $700 for Mayapur-Vrindaban scheme. Similarly Siddha Svarupa Maharaja met me in San Francisco. He took part in the Ratha yatra festival and paid me $501 for Mayapur-Vrindaban scheme. So let us cojointly work for the satisfaction of Krishna. So long I am living I wish you all be strictly under my guidance without any fratricidal disagreement. There is very good scope for preaching our cult all over the world, so let us do it cojointly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
