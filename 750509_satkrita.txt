My dear Satkrita dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 8th, 1975 and I was unable to note the contents. Why do you write such a crazy letter? You cannot write like a normal person? Anyway, I hope that you are following all of the rules and regulations very carefully without any deviation. Try to work hard for Krishna and co-operate very nicely with the temple authorities.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
