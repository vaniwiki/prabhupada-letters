My dear Candanacarya,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife, Srimati Kasturika Dasi. I am in due receipt of your nice letter dated 2nd July, and I am very glad to learn that you are now happily married. I beg to thank you also for the check of your contribution for my book fund, it is very welcome at this time and for the nice photographs of your wedding ceremony.

So I think you tried to get yourself married sometimes before and now Krsna has given you one very good wife. You are intelligent boy, hard worker and devotee of Krsna and your wife is very fine girl and sincere devotee also, so you both, husband and wife, combined together work for your mutual advancement in Krsna consciousness. That is my desire.

I am very pleased also to note how you are appreciating the grace of the Spiritual Master and Krsna for guiding one in the progressive path of spiritual realization. Now both you and your wife simply carry out our instructions for keeping always engaged in Krsna activities according to strict following of the rules and regulations and chant Hare Krsna and be happy. It is so much encouraging to learn that Masturika Dasi is already helping you in your Krsna conscious work. May Krsna bless you both with advanced Krsna consciousness.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
