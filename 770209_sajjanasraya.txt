Dear Sajjanasraya,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 11, and heard the contents.

I think it is best that you come to Mayapur for the Gour Purnima Festival and we can talk in detail about the temple and preaching in Fiji and your part in it. If you can come to Mayapur that will be nice. You have asked a number of questions and they can be answered then.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
