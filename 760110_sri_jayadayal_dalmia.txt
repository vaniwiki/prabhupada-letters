Dear Sri Jayadayalji,

Please accept my best wishes. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7th January, 1976. As you have suggested that someone from our institution be opted as a member of the Managing Committee, I have selected Sri Vishvambhar Dayala as well as myself. Both of us may be made members, and I shall give instructions through him.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
