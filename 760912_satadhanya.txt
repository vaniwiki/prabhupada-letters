Mayapur

My dear Satadhanya Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6 September 1976 and have noted the contents. Please continue this program of preaching and distributing __Gita-gan__ as far as possible for this is our real business.

As far as your visa goes, if you have an entry visa, it can be extended. What is the nature of your visa? I shall telegram you if something can be done here. It is very nice that this publicity has attracted so many people to see our mandir. This is wanted. But are you selling books from the temple? I may be there in Mayapur by the beginning of December.

As you depend on me I similarly depend on you, __parasparatam.__ The brahmanas and ksatriyas should cooperate, that is the Vedic civilization. The hands and legs should cooperate with the brain in order for the whole society to work properly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
