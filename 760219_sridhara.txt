My dear Sridhara Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Herewith Vrindaban is going to you. Please hand over the key as I instructed you and take the letters signed by him. Make three (3) copies in the letter heading of Vrinda Book Co. Keep two (2) copies with you and one (1) copy give to Vrindaban. I hope you have already furnished the room, if not do it quickly because they will enter the house tomorrow in the morning.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
