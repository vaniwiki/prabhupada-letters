My dear Hrdayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Nov. 27, 1974 with enclosed Spanish BTG and have noted the contents very carefully and looked through the new Spanish BTG. This new BTG is done very nicely. The printing is very beautiful and I thank you very much for doing such a nice job. I am very glad to hear you have printed 100,000 copies of this magazine. Now give them to everyone. Also I am very happy to hear the other books will be coming out very soon. If you can finish __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ in Spanish and show me at the Mayapur festival that will be very sublime. Please print as many books as possible, this is my real pleasure. By printing these books of our Krsna Conscious philosophy in so many different languages we can actually inject our movement into the masses of persons all over the world, especially there in the western countries and we can literally turn whole nations into Krsna Conscious nations. Thank you for representing me there in LSS by stressing the importance of attendance to the morning and evening programs and following all of the spiritual practices. This is wanted. Without these things there is no devotional life. And by your example many others will also become strong.

Regarding my coming to Mexico City and Caracas, yes I want to come there very much. Now we are in Bombay trying to get permission from the government to build our temple. And it appears that we will possibly be getting the permission next week. If this works out then I will immediately be going to Honolulu and from Honolulu I can go directly to Mexico City, then Caracas, and then to Australia by the end of Jan. If the Bombay situation is not settled up I may have to stay till mid-Jan. or so and then in mid or end of Jan. I will be going to Australia to stay for one month. After Australia we had planned to go to S. Africa for two weeks, but if this does not work out then I could come to Mexico City and Caracas at that time. Anyway I will let you know as soon as our plan becomes definite. I am always anxious to hear your reports of new book publications and sales.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
