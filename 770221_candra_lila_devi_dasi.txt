Dear Candra lila devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your note along with the folio of drawings for the proposed “__Bhagavad-gita__ Coloring Book”. I can see from this work that you are a talented artist. However, I do not think we can publish this book. The reason is that the __Bhagavad-gita__ is not a play-toy for boys, but philosophy to be understood by saintly kings, rajarsis.

A coloring book for children is not a serious presentation of __Bhagavad-gita__. You mention that you were applying your artistic abilities with the deities working with Govinda dasi in Hawaii. If there is more engagement in that way take it up, or try to paint for our books. We can use unlimited amounting paintings for the Bhagavatam, as well as for our temples.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
