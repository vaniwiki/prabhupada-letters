My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6/5/73. I have noted the contents carefully.

I have already sent you one letter dated May 11, 1973 as well as a copy of a letter sent to Madan Mohan Goswami by registered post that same day. I trust you have received that letter by now and you are proceeding as per my instructions therein.

First of all ask Gaurachand Goswami that he is taking the money on account of two rooms occupied by me, now Madan Mohan Goswami has asked us to vacate, so clearly understand from him what is our position. Whether he is going to accept the money continually or does not like to accept it. So on hearing this statement, if he says that he'll not accept and we must vacate, then it is to be understood that all the Shebaits have combined together to evict us. Then we'll have to take the matter to the rent controller court as I have already advised in my previous letter.

In India we have got experience, there are so many cheaters. So be very carefully of them and do everything carefully, keeping in touch with all the senior members and do the needful.

I am advised by my Calcutta physician that I should go back to India. So I am returning and will reach in Calcutta sometime next week. Ananda Pandu wanted to stay with me, so if he likes he can come to Mayapur where I shall stay. Offer him my dandabats.

So far as Mr. Sarkar, our engineer, is concerned, if he becomes too much of a disturbance then you may dismiss him.

Hoping this meets you in good health.
