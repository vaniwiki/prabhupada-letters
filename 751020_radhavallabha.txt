My dear Radhavallabha dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the 4 volumes of Caitanya-caritamrta and your letter dated October 1, 1975 and I have noted the contents carefully.

Concerning the synonyms, henceforward I am adding the synonyms myself. From yesterday night I have begun adding the synonyms as it doesn't save very much time to have the synonyms.

The Upadesamrta can be composed in the Bhagavatam format in the size of the pocket NOD.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
