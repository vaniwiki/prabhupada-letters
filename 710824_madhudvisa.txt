My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. You should not close any deal about the house of Dr. Bali without seeing it. Actually there is no need of seeing the house at this time. If I go to Madras, then at that time I shall see it and we shall purchase it by local contribution. See the copy of the letter I have sent to Dr. Bali, enclosed, in this connection. So if Dr. Bali agrees to this proposal, then I can go there immediately.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
