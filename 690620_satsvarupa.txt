My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept by blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 18, 1969, and I have noted the contents. The pictures you have sent are very nice, and they shall be published in __BTG.__ Regarding Madan Mohan, I understand that he would like to remain in Boston, but previously he was indexing __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ If he is able to work there on this project, I have no objection. Otherwise he may come back to New York. Sometimes, out of their own accord, devotees decide to leave a center, but this is not a good practice. If he can continue his indexing work there, then he may remain in Boston.

I am very pleased to learn that you are planning for a nice Rathayatra Festival in Boston. Please do it nicely, and take many nice photographs for publication in __BTG.__ Yesterday I received one telegram from London to send them by cable $1,025.00. They require this for their house there. This money was to be for a down payment on purchasing an IBM machine for our books, and therefore I now need some money. If you have got some extra money, you can help me. You have encouraged my writing books, and for printing each book will require not less than 6 or 8 thousand dollars. Under the circumstances, I request all centers that as soon as they have extra money, it should be sent to me. Immediately I wish to publish __Nectar of Devotion__ second edition of First Canto, and first edition of Second Canto of __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ So if you will help me in this matter, it will be very nice. After this, I wish to publish __Krishna.__ In this way I want to prolong the publication work. I am going to Los Angeles to collect some money, and similarly I am requesting you also to help in this matter.

Please convey my blessing to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
