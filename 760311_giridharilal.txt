My dear Giridharilal,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letter dated March 8, 1976 and I have noted the contents very carefully. It will be a great pleasure for me to meet with you either at Delhi or Vrindaban when I return the 26th of March, this month, to Delhi. More when we meet. In the meantime, I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
