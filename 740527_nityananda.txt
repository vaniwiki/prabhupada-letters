My dear Nityananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 29, 1974.

On your recommendation I have accepted Robbie Bernstein and James Steelman a my initiated disciples, and their spiritual names are as follows:

Robbie---Rajendra dasa

James---Jvarajit dasa

Please work with them carefully so they will always keep up chanting their rounds and remain enthusiastic to follow the principles.

I am also accepting Jogindra vandana for second initiation who has been initiated for two years. I want to stress to you to be very cautious about giving me recommendation for second initiation. There are four orders of life, it is not that everyone has to be a brahmana just because he has been initiated 1 or 2 or any number of years. Especially if one cannot even rise early for mangala arati he should never be given brahminical initiation. All your programs are encouraging to me and keep sending me information.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
