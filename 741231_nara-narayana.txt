My dear Nara-narayana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 28th, 1974 and have noted the contents. For the time being, continue doing what you are doing consulting Hansadutta and others. I shall advise you. Whatever income you are getting, give to the temple. Go regularly to the temple and raise your child. There is no need of loitering here and there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
