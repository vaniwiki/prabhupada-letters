My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th April, 1970, and have noted the contents carefully. I have referred the matters concerning Ananda, temple management, etc. to Gargamuni, and He will advise you further in this matter.

In the meantime, I invite you to come visit me here in L.A. for a week or so, then you can speak with me directly. So please try to come here at your earliest convenience, and that will be very nice.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
