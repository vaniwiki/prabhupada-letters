My dear Saurabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 15/11/74 and the account. I had wanted an account of the last Rs. 5,10,000/- that was sent to you. Please give me that account, how it was spent for the construction. Now we have sent you Rs. 1,25,000/- and I am sending another Rs. 1,75,000/-.

Now Bhugarbha reports that you say the asrama will not be completed for the opening festival. The program was already postponed because the asrama was not finished. Therefore __everything__ must be cent per cent completed by the end of March. Is the contractor cheating? That means it will never be finished. Simply we have to put money. From the photos I have seen, there is not very much progress. What to do?

I want no explanations. I want to see everything finished. If there is still doubt, please tell me frankly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
