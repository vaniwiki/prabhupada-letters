Sri Durga Prasadji Gupta, Asst. Manager\\
GITA PRESS\\
P.O. Gita Press, Gorakhpur\\
INDIA

Dear Sri Gupta,

Sri Jayadayal Dalmia has requested me to send you our edition of __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ because you are collecting all different editions of the __Gita.__ In this connection I beg to inform you that I have already sent one copy directly to Hanuman Prasadji Poddar, but have received no acknowledgement as yet, although the book was sent sometime at the beginning of this year. Please, therefore, inquire from Hanuman Prasadji if he has received the copy. If not, I shall send another copy to you.

Yours truly,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
