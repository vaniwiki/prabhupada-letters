My dear Jayasacinandana Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 2, 1975. No! you have made some discovery. All along you have been hearing the recording of Yamuna devi and now you want to change. It is not ordinary singing, it is concert, many people are singing, so it is not bad. Just like Sankirtana, many voices are there, men and women, so it is the same thing, sankirtana. I approve of it. Here in Krishna Balarama Temple we are hearing the same recording every morning, so if it is good here why not there?

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
