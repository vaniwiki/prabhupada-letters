====== Letter to: Sridama ======

Province Town, Massachusetts

My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th July, 1970, and I thank you very much for your check for $2,000. It is a great help to me because in this month I have paid about $20,000 for printing my books and your contribution is welcome.

I have also read the newspaper cuttings in which I understand that people accept our Society as genuine and religious. So it is Krsna's grace that they are giving you permission to chant on the streets. I am sure if we work very sincerely all facilities will come from Krsna. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that Krsna personally carries the necessities of His devotee and gives protection to his status quo.

So let us all believe in the words of Krsna and serve Him to our best capacity and thus we will come out victorious in every field of action. By the grace of Krsna you are a beautiful young man with nice intelligence, devotion and spirit, so employ all of them in the service of the Lord along with your good wife and be successful in Krsna consciousness.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
