My dear Cyavana Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your telegram to Brahmananda Swami and am glad to learn that you have opened a center in Zambia. You have made some progress there since going and I am pleased. You are a good worker. All my disciples they are good boys, intelligent, and hard working. I pray to Krishna that you all may use your intelligence for Krishna's service and not for any personal ambition. We have worked very hard and established a great institution, but if we think for our personal benefit then it will become ruined. This is my only concern.

Now Caitya-guru is going there, and I understand that Dinanath and others will also go to Africa. So engage these men nicely, and Krishna will give you all facilities according to your capacity for serving Him.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
