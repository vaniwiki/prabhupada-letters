Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. We should not criticize the Ramakrishna Mission by name, or directly, for they have become somehow or other popular and people are against us for it. So carefully avoid this type of preaching.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL\\
N.B. All the letters from public to me may send to me immediately.
