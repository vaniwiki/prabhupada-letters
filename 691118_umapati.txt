My dear Umapati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 8, 1969 with pictures enclosed. They are very nice. I understand the whole situation that you have not yet been able to find out a suitable place for living together, although Janardana is there. I think the same problem was experienced by the London devotees previously. Anyway, you will be pleased to learn that Tamala from Los Angeles has come here, and our Sankirtana Party has got some engagement in Hamburg from the 20th through the 24th of this month, so they will stay in the Hamburg temple for 4 or 5 days. Janardana wrote me in some letter a few days back asking if I can go there, but due to the climatic condition I do not wish to move further from here. So you consult amongst yourselves whether you require Tamala's and the Sankirtana Party's help. You can let them know immediately in Hamburg. The address is Internationalle Gesellschaft fur Krishna Bewusstein, 2 Hamburg 6, Bartelsstrasse 65, West Germany.

The sooner you find out a center of our own, the better it will be. Anyway, pull on as you are doing your best, and Krishna will help you in due course. Here the preaching work is going nicely. The London party has now a van for 13 people, and they are going to Germany in that car. If you are eager to receive them, you write to them in Germany immediately. Maybe it will be possible for them to go to Paris and do some propaganda work.

I am very pleased that you are finding your life becoming more and more beautiful. Krishna Conscious life is our natural life. Just like a diseased person, the more he comes back to his health it becomes pleasing more and more; similarly, the more we come to Krishna Consciousness, certainly it will be pleasing, because Krishna is the Reservoir of all pleasure.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
