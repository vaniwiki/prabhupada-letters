====== Letter to: Members of the family of Hirjibhai Gelabhai Baba ======

To the members of the family of Hirjibhai Gelabhai Baba.\\
Respected ladies and gentlemen of the family:

I am very sorry to learn that His Holiness Hirji Baba has recently disappeared from this material world. Last time when I was in Nairobi, I had some talks with him when we were preparing to take lunch at the house of Damji Devji. That was our last talk. So it is a great shock that he is not visible to our eyes. But as we know, the living being does not die. It is said about the saintly persons: moro va jivo va which means that the saintly person devoted to the lotus feet of the Lord is always glorious, either physically present or not present. So I wish that the devotees who took shelter of this saintly person continue to progress in spiritual life. May Krishna bless all of you in spiritual life.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
