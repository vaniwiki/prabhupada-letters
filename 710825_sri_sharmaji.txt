Surinam

My dear Sri Sharmaji,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your Hindi letter dated 12th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. You will be interested to know that we have got 62 branches all over the world and can open one branch there in your place but you have to invite us, a party of ten men, and arrange for tickets there and back as well as accommodations for at least one month. Then we can go in a party.

And we can defy any opposing elements, not to mention the arya samaj. The arya samaj movement started in India but now it is dead and gone. A few people are there only. Similarly if we open our temple at Paramatibo, Surinam certainly any opposing elements will be driven away. We are preaching on the basis of Bhagavad-gita, the most exalted vedic literature. The atheistic arya samaj does not believe in Bhagavad-gita. Therefore they are not strictly speaking followers of the Vedic varnasrama dharma.

So if you are serious you have to arrange to receive us in a ten man party and pay all expenditures and travelling expenses, etc. for one month.

In the future please be kind enough to make correspondence in English because we do not know Hindi.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
