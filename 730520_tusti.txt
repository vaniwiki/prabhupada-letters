My dear Tusti dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 17, 1973. Thank you very much.

You ask: "You said when you gave me the name Tusti dasi, 'Now you can be satisfied without eating.' Do you mean that I should eat very little?" Yes in spiritual life one must be careful not to eat more than is required to keep body and soul together. The most important point is that one becomes satisfied by serving Krsna rather than by serving the senses.

Now, please always follow the four regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds minimum every day without fail.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
