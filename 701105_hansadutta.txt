====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

Calcutta

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I have not received any letter from you since I left Calcutta---neither from Kirtanananda Swami nor Acyutananda Swami. I do not know how things are going on there. I shall be glad to hear of your activities and enrollment of life members. In the meantime, I've received one invitation from Madan-mohan Mintri (enclosed) which speaks for itself. The copy of the reply is also enclosed herein. If you receive any letter from him, you can consider the case for going there with him with full party.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
