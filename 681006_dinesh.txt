My dear Dinesh,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 3, 1968, and have noted the contents. I am preparing for going away from this place for somewhere else by the end of the next week. So you can come and see me at once on receipt of this letter and we shall talk in detail. Bring the following things also along with your film tapes, namely:

1. __My passport and two certificates which are lying with Cidananda.__ These are very important documents and __bring them within your inside pocket carefully.__

2. Some files and large brown envelopes that are lying in San Francisco.

Krishna devi may not come with you because she is in mature condition. If you think your absence at this stage will not be advisable for Krishna devi's mature stage, then don't come.

Hoping you are both well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
