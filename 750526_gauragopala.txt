My dear Gauragopala dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. I think it is very obvious, even you have admitted, that the problem is that you are not following the basic principles of our society. The fact that you have not chanted your rounds for a long time is enough to make you without any spiritual strength. The best thing for you is to seriously try to follow all of the rules and regulations very strictly under the guidance of the temple authorities. Then your mind will become very clear, not so agitated. You have taken initiation from me, so actually you are obliged to do this. You have promised, therefore there is no choice,---you must follow strictly. Otherwise, you are carving your pathway to hell.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
