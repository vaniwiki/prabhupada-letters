Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Gangamayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your undated letter. I am glad to hear that you are determined to stay and live in the temple now and that you are becoming very much attached to the Deity worship and very serious about serving the Deity along with Malati Prabhu. I hope your restlessness is finished and that you will remain a faithful servitor in your duties with the Deities.

Your comment is well taken that you have little or no knowledge of the politics. So you remain uninvolved and just continue to simply follow the authorities and concentrate on improving the Deity worship. If you chant at least 16 rounds daily and read our books, no contamination can touch us. I hope to see you in the near future at Bhaktivedanta Manor.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
