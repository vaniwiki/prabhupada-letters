ALL GLORIES TO SRI GURU AND GAURANGA!

My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated November 29, 1973.

Thank you for the report of the progress of Temples in your Canadian Zone. Now that we have opened some Centers, they must be maintained and our work go on. Book and prasadam distribution, Sankirtana and Deity worship is our only business so these programs must remain energetic. Your number one duty is to see that they are continuously carried on with enthusiasm. One thing is that we shall not open any more Centers for the time being. We have so many programs which require manpower and resources so we now must consolidate our energy.

I hereby accept the following devotees as my initiated disciples and their names are enclosed:

Sylvan Lushley---Niskincana das\\
Jocelyn Prabhu---Ghosh Thakura das\\
Linda Ross---Malini dasi\\
Linda Epstein---Rudrani dasi\\
Moria Jones---Pratima dasi\\
Mary Everall---Misrani dasi

Enclosed also find three sacred threads and six mantra sheets for the second initiates. Hold a yajna and afterwards they may hear the Gayatri mantra through the tape in the right ear. All the initiates should collect daksina and send it to Los Angeles c/o Karandhara.

I will consider coming to Toronto later on. For now, carry on as my representative there and be strong and always faithful in Guru and Krsna.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

ACBS/Kda
