My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 13rd Sept. and letter dated Oct. 18. Due to travelling and so much work, I was not able to answer you sooner.

I'm very happy to hear that you are once again in Berlin. When you first went to Germany by yourself, I was praying that Krishna would help you in every way to establish a center there in Berlin. Now you have done it by the grace of Krishna. Berlin is one of the most important cities in Europe and is one of the gateways to the communist world, and since your temple has a central location with good room space, everything is set for our preaching program. It is a good sign that the Berlin people are receiving our Sankirtana so well that with only one other devotee you have distributed 100 magazines in an afternoon. Yes, on Sankirtana we want everyone we meet to go away with a magazine and having heard and chanted Hare Krishna Mantra. That will be the sign of success. Please have Mandali Bhadra's mother help you in every way possible. I think she is well acquainted with Berlin and she can render good service. So give a start to our Krishna Consciousness Movement there and that will be your success.

Now you have a nice German devotee wife, and together you should give all the people of Germany the example of how husband and wife can be engaged for the service of Krishna, not in the service of their senses. The two of you, along with Sucandra and Gunai, should lead a nice regulated daily schedule of chanting 16 rounds, reading all our books, going on Sankirtana Party, and taking nice Prasadam. Then this will keep you pure and potent in your preaching work.

I have received your Vyasa Puja offering and it is very nice. Please offer my blessings to the others.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
