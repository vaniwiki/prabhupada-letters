My dear Mahamsa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2/11/76.

I am ready. When you call I shall come. So far Kadal kanal is concerned, I shall decide when I am in Hyderabad.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
