My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14th April, 1970, and I am very much encouraged to learn that things are going on there very nicely specifically in the printing department which is now the most important department in our Society.

Regarding George's introduction, it is now definitely decided not to be published. We have already mentioned his contribution in the preface and that is sufficient for the present.

Regarding Devahuti, sometime before I had some discussion with her that she will go to India and help in constructing our temple there. So now we are getting our land there and if she is able to help in this connection, then her going to India will be a great service to Krsna. I understand that she has many American lady friends, and if she approaches them, then we can build at Mayapur a place for retired American ladies to live there peacefully in Krishna Consciousness.

Yes, if the BTG can be published in the States it will be a great facility because we can print every month. So try to get things done very smoothly by mutual arrangement, and that will give me great satisfaction.

In KRSNA chapter #87, on page 4, the last line, it is said, "known as __budbuvasa,__ which is manifested by Govinda." I do not know what is this editing. The correct word is __Bhurbhuvasvah__ as it is in the Gayatri mantra and everybody knows it. This "budbuvasa" is an extraordinary word, neither it is Sanskrit nor English, so how it has avoided the vigilance of so many editors? So if none of the editors knew this word, why was it pushed? There should be no such negligences like this, nothing uncertain should be pushed. Now what other discrepancies there may be like this? Or what is the use of such editing? Everything must be done very carefully and attentively.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
