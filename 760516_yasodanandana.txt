My dear Yasodanandana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 4, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

By this time you should have received the money I sent for your book printing in Hyderabad. I sent you one check care of Mahamsa Swami, bank draft FH 099222, for $1,700, the equivalent of just over Rs. 15,000/-, which you requested as an advance for printing books. I have to this time received no reply from either Mahamsa Swami, and neither an acknowledgement of reciept of the bank draft from yourself. Please check on this, it was sent to the Hyderabad temple address by registered post care of Mahamsa Swami. Further I gave instructions in my letter to you of May 5, 1976, how you can repay this loan to you. I am concerned to see that this arrived safely through the post.

I have informed Gopala Krsna that you may also use the color transparencies for the printing of your books in South India. Radhavallabha is sending Gopala Krsna all the transparencies from all of our books as we intend to print all of our books in India for profuse distribution.

I am very encouraged to hear about the large crowds that are coming to the programs and taking our books. Concerning the new boy who has joined you from the Hubli program, you can keep him with you as you see fit, but be careful about money matters. Sometimes they will join with some ulterior motive. In the beginning, be very careful with money matters.

As regards your desire for Sadbhuja Deity, if your divert your attention to worship, that will not be good. Time is short. You can keep one picture for your darsana.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
