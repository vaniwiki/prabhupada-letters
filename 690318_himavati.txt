My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated February 21, 1969, along with the Deity dress. It has come to me late on account of changing places so quickly and the statement given by you in the matter of worshiping the Deity is super excellent. Please continue this system and Krishna will bestow upon you all blessings. If one attains perfection in Deity worship, that is called Arcana Siddhi. Arcana Siddhi means simply by Deity worship one goes back to Godhead, immediately after this life. So this Arcana Siddhi program is given in the Narada Pancaratra especially for the householders. Householders cannot undergo strict disciplinary activities of austerity, therefore for every householder the path of Arcana Siddhi is very much recommended. According to Vedic system, all householders are ordered to keep Deity at home and follow strictly the worshipment process. That makes the home pure, body pure, mind pure, and quickly promotes one to the pure platform of spiritual life. The temple is also specially meant for the householders. In India, in every town, in every village, in every neighborhood, still there are Visnu temples for the convenience of the surrounding householders. So I am pleased that you are ideal householder. And you are doing very nicely combined together husband and wife. Please do it as you are doing and gradually Krishna will give you all facility.

Regarding Vedanta Sutra tapes, please ask Hansadutta to send me the copies of transcription so that I can make another tape. If I read the copy then it gives me impetus to write further.

I am enclosing herewith one copy of letter from one German gentleman. I could not read it. So will you send me the English translation of this letter. And if possible you can write to him that this letter has been received very late by Swamiji Maharaja, so you acknowledge receipt of the letter immediately. In the meantime, on receipt of the translation, I shall reply.

Hope you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
