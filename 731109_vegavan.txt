My dear Vegavan Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24/10/73 and have noted the contents. It is very good to hear of your programs in the high schools. Please continue and increase this program there.

It is a nice name you have chosen for your son, Murali Dhara Das. I give all my blessings to your son. Please raise him as a Krsna conscious child and be happy to become parents of a nice Vaisnava.

I hope this meets you and your good wife in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
