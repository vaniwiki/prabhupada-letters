====== Letter to: Ramesvara ======

My dear Ramesvara Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Please find enclosed one bank draft 1-8/210, 4 (number 262) for the amount of U.S. dollars 1,737.00 (one thousand seven hundred and thirty seven). This is for deposit in the Bank of America on favor of ISKCON Mayapur-Vrindaban Fund a/c no. 6004-07143. Kindly send me the deposit slip when the transaction is completed.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
