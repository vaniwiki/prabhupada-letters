My dear Revatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice letter dated 18 March, 1970, along with a check for my book fund paid by blessed Roy Richard. I am enclosing one letter to him herewith, which please hand over to him.

From the description of your letter it is to be understood that things are going very nicely in your center. Our line of action is very simple, and if you stick to the principles, then success is sure.

Regarding your question about the various demoniac species of life: the Lord's condemnation, although appearing to be very harsh, is not so. The Lord being Absolute, His condemnation is as good as His blessings. Whenever the Lord or anyone of His pure devotees condemns somebody, it is to be taken as blessing. You know that the great sage Narada condemned the sons of Kuvera to become trees, but as a result of this, they were able to see Lord Krsna which is very difficult even for the great mystic yogis.

You have been a little bit perturbed that the demons are eternally condemned, and I thank you very much that you have been compassionate with the demons. That is the sign of Vaisnavism. The Lord may condemn the demons, but because the Vaisnavas are there, there is ample chance for the demons to become blessed by the devotees of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord are so powerful that each and every one of them has the power of delivering many demons, even condemned by the Lord. The preaching work of Krishna Consciousness Movement is specifically meant for delivering the demons. Therefore, if you remain faithful to the Lord, you shall be able to deliver many such demons.

So there is no cause of being disappointed because of the demons being condemned by the Lord. It is the duty of the devotee to deliver them. And the Lord is so powerful that through His pure devotee anyone can be delivered, never mind how he is fallen or condemned. I think the answer of your question is now clear and you can do the needful.

I have gone through the newspaper articles sent by you, and they are very important. Continue to work like this in cooperation with Dininath Prabhu who is a very good devotee. Prabhavati's husband, Harer Nama, is here in L.A. now.

Please convey my blessings to all the Prabhus there working under your good direction.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
