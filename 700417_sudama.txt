My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much anxious to hear from you about your activities. I sent you one tape record as desired by you and I hope you must have received it. So you please keep me informed about your activities at least once a fortnight.

In the meantime I have received some quotations of Japanese printers, sent by you. One of them is replied as per carbon copy enclosed, and if possible try to see them if they are agreeable.

Please enlighten me by return mail how you are making progress in our movement, how the Japanese people are responding. Naturally I am very much anxious to know that.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
