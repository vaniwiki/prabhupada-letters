My dear Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 13, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. Unless there is some favorable opinions there is no need of opening a temple there.

Unless one understands what is Krishna they will simply accuse us of having idol worship. They must first understand the science of Krsna then they may appreciate the temple. So go and and distribute as many books as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
