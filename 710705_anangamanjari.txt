My dear Anangamanjari Devi Dasi (Elaine),

Please accept my blessings. I have just recently received one letter from your good husband Hrdayananda Prabhu and he has recommended you highly for initiation. So I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple and have given you the spiritual name Anangamanjari Devi Dasi. Anangamanjari was one of the gopis and younger sister of Srimati Radharani. Also I have chanted on your beads and they are enclosed herewith.

I am so glad to hear how you are strictly following the regulative principles, chanting at least 16 rounds of beads daily, and associating with devotees exclusively for the past year. That is our very strength in spiritual life, and if you continue to do so, then your rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness is certain. Read our books, attend classes and go for street Sankirtana and in this way engage yourself in Krishna's business 24 hours. That is my request. Then you will be happy and your life will be a success. And you have got such an intelligent and enthusiastic husband. He is a good boy, I know. So give him all encouragement and assistance to execute Krishna Consciousness nicely there in Gainesville, Florida. That is your duty as wife, the better half of the husband. So do it nicely.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
