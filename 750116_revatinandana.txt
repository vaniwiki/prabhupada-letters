My dear Revatinandana Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 27, 1974 and have noted the contents. Your program sounds very nice. Please go on with this work continuously preaching and as far as possible, try to sell some books also.

Regarding your fasting, if you are sick, then fasting is the best medicine. For disease and unwanted guests, if you do not give them food, they will go away.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
