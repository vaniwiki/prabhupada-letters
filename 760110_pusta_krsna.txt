My dear Pusta Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your two letters dated December 23rd and 24th respectively.

I have just sent you a telegram: "Yes Purchase Mercedes." For so long there has been contemplation to buy this car. But where is the car? We are spending crores of Rupees to finish this Bombay construction, but whenever I arrive at the airport, I am picked up in a borrowed car. What kind of impression is it to the members that we always have to approach them to borrow their car? Please get it. But one thing is that I have heard that you are taking the money from the BBT to pay for it. There is one story that a guru went to his disciple's home and was greeted very elaborately. When he enquired how was it possible for his disciple to afford such nice arrangements, his disciple told him: every-belongs to you. Later the guru saw that he had no money left in his bank account and he could understand that his disciple had spent all of his money. So whether you are also making such arrangements? I do not want to spend the books fund money for such things. If you can not pay for it, then Tamala Krishna says he will pay Ramesvara who can send you the money.

Thank you for appreciating Sri Caitanya-caritamrta. There is no need to feel sad at the end of a chapter or a volume because there is always another chapter and another volume. There is no scarcity. You want more nectarine and the supply is also there. Those who are actually looking for spiritual culture will find immense wealth in Caitanya-caritamrta.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
