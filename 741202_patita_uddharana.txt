====== Letter to: Patita Uddharana ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Patita Uddharana das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 21, 1974 and have noted the contents. It is nice that you had a nice Diwali-Govardhana Puja celebration. I have not received any photos however. Regarding the Indian gentleman Krishna Das, he can go to Dallas and teach Sanskrit and English, or he can come here to Bombay if he likes.

As you are doing secretarial duties there at the Manor, there is one matter I would like you to look into. There is one man Mr. Mody. What happened? He is a big man. Now Kausalya has irritated him. Try to compromise the situation, and inform me.

I Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
