My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18th March, 1977.

There is no need to pay Gaurachand. I have already advised the bank, and they will pay him directly. You need not. As you have described the placing of my photograph and offering to it Prasadam, that is good. In consultation with Aksayananda Maharaja, just find out some responsible men to stay there. Everything should be kept neat and clean as if I am staying there. It is very good if someone daily sells books from there.

Thank you, yes, I am feeling a little stronger now. On the 28th instant I shall be moving into my new quarters and then we have to organize Bombay as our world headquarters from every point of view, culturally, scientifically, philosophically, etc.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
