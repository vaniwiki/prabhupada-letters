My dear Amogha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 11, 1972 and I have noted the contents. You are very intelligent boy, that I can understand, and you are very eager to serve Krishna with full capacity. So I am very much encouraged to see that you have taken over the leadership position in Melbourne. Now if you work very nicely in co-operation with Mohanananda to develop our Australia program, that will be very much pleasing to me. I especially have great hopes for our Australia yatra. I notice when I was there so many young people without any spiritual direction. So your mission is to attract them somehow or other to our philosophy of Krishna Consciousness. Make the covers of the book very much attractive so that automatically they will read the knowledge inside. The covers are like the mind and the senses, and the contents of the book are the soul. So sometimes in order to attract people to find out what is the soul we have to decorate the mind and the senses and make the presentation of Krishna consciousness very palatable to them. So in this way cooperate very nicely with your all good god-brothers there in Australia to deliver all of these fallen souls, especially the young people, back to Home, back to Godhead.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
