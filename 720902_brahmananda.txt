My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter from Tanzania dated August 24, 1972, and with great satisfaction I have noted the contents. Yes, the preaching work is giving you new life. My Guru Maharaja Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati used to say __pran acche var sehetu pracar,__ "one can preach who has got life." So one who is preaching this Krishna Consciousness Movement means he has got real life.

I am very glad to hear that your programmes in Tanzania and other places are coming out very successful and everyone is becoming satisfied by your presesnce in their towns and villages. That is a very good plan for making twice on the magazine and books by selling once to the Hindus and again to the Africans. You and your brother Gargamuni Maharaja are always good brain for making some money, but I think that he is little better than you for making money, but I like your plan very much. Yes, now go on in this way making tour all over Africa, following the same plan you have chalked out of making Life Members, selling books and magazines, holding kirtana, distributing prasadam, dancing, like that. One thing is, I have recently got one letter from Mr. Shah wherein he mentions there are many temples being offered to us in Uganda by the Indians who must leave there. So I understand you are going there soon, so why not take them if they are offering freely? We shall have to send you many Americans for managing them.

Our Bhagavata Dharma Discourses are going on very nicely here in New Vrindaban, and hundreds of devotees and other persons from outside are also coming here, and there is one large pavilion on the hill-top where I speak every evening and the meetings are being very well appreciated by all. Now go on holding this Bhagavata Dharma discourses in every city of the world, in simple way, as we have done it in Nairobi, speaking something, having kirtana, distributing prasadam, and keep place to stay, camping and tents, for the devotees and guests, and in this way very quickly Lord Caitanya's movement will be spread all over the world and actually everyone will get enlightenment out of it.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
