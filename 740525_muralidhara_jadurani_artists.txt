My dear Muralidhara, Jadurani and artists of the art department,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 22, hand delivered to me by Atreya Rsi prabhu.

As far as your questions which information you urgently need for completion of the paintings, the answers are as follows.

It is correct to show Prthu Maharaja giving a speech to the Kumaras inside his home.

For Lord Visnu's appearing at Prthu Maharaja's sacrifice, the sketch you have enclosed is all right.

Lord Visnu should rest His left hand on Garuda.

As for the wooden sacrificial instrument mentioned during Daksa's sacrifice, yes you can use it in Maharaja Prthu's sacrifice.

[ILLUSTRATION]

It looks like this. It is a block, like the bottom on a guillotine on which the animal is made to lay his head and then his head is cut off.

When Prthu and Archi appeared they looked about 30 or 40 years old.

They were dressed opulently like King and Queen with crowns.

So I am glad that you are fully absorbed in your work and very concerned that it be executed just to my satisfaction in parampara standard. This is your perfection. I am hopeful we will continue our cooperation as I have many many more books to write if you can only keep up with me in publishing and painting.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
