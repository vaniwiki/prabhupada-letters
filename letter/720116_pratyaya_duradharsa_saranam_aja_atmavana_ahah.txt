My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Bhakta das, I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Harry Pettee/ PRATYAYA DAS\\
Dennis Weatherman/ DURADHARSA DAS\\
Sharon Robinson/ SARANAM DASI\\
Marnie Watson/ AJA DASI\\
Elaine Carnerie/ ATMAVANA DASI\\
Norah Haas/ AHAH DASI

I am so glad to learn that all of you have been such a great help to Bhakta das there in our San Diego center. I can understand that all of you are very sincere boys and girls and are very eligible candidates for going back to Home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

I hope this will meet all of you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
