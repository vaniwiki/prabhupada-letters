My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th November, 1970 and I have noted the contents carefully.

You write to say that you have asked Karandhara to send some money received for the bookfund to pay for paper. That is alright provided that Karandhara can also continue making payments to Dai Nippon. The problem is that book money isn't being properly collected. Big books like KRSNA and NOD: NOD, 5,000 books printed @ $4.00 = $20,000.; KRSNA - 10,000 printed at $8.00 = $80,000. for a total of $100,000. $70,000. or $80,000. should have been collected, but Karandhara has only collected $24,000. So where is the rest of the money? This means that the money is not being collected properly. What can be done? Also there were so many small booklets printed. Where is the collection for them also? If collections are not being made properly, then there will be a shortage of money. So how to adjust things?

Arrangements should be made so that book collection can be made properly. Also how the books are collected, how accounts are kept, how books are distributed. Then there will be no scarcity of money. Even if you take $5,000. to $10,000., that's all right so long as Karandhara can send to Dai Nippon at least $50,000. So what will be the cost of printing and folding 5,000 NODs? If Karandhara can't pay, I will see how to get it from here. (You can print and fold there and send here for collating and binding.)

So far as minimizing the use of Sanskrit words in BTG, that is very nice. There is no need for so much Sanskrit. Therefore I object to the Brahma-Samhita edition. I use Sanskrit, but the purport I give immediately.

I just want to see that these books be printed, whether it be on our own press or by Dai Nippon; that is my ambition. I have become slackened in my dictaphone work because the manuscripts already there are not being pushed ahead. So far as books like KRSNA, NOD, TLC, I am sure that they'll be accepted everywhere---all over the world, so we should keep sufficient stock of them, and Bhagavad-gita also. So you should arrange for reprinting and folding of 5,000 NODs and send them here as soon as possible. Also please arrange for reprinting of TLC.

Pradyumna has to create another assistant locally. It is not possible at the present time to send a man from here, at least for the present moment. So he has to work a little hard. He should have created by now another assistant. I think his wife can become the best assistant.

Please offer my blessings to all the other devotees there. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
