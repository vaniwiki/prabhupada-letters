====== Jayapataka ======

<card class="letter">
Mayapur

Dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Our plan is to arrive in Calcutta on the morning of February 4th; after a day or two, we will come to Mayapur.

In the meantime, what is the position of the Panihati scheme? I want you to negotiate with the municipality so that we can take over management of Raghava Pandit's house. Our first project will be to take pictures of this house, and then tear it down for exact reconstruction. Therefore, complete the negotiations so we can proceed. More when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
