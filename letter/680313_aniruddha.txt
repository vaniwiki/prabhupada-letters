Los Angeles

My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter, undated, and post-dated March 12, 1968. I am so obliged to you for your hospitality with which you served me so long I was in Los Angeles; I was so much comfortably situated in spite of my not very good health. Krishna will bless you for your strenuous service single-handedly, rest assured. Please continue your service attitude in the same spirit, and Krishna will bless you with all benediction.

In the meantime, Mukunda and Janaki have come there, and I hope together you will do service to the Temple to your best capacity. I have got very good impression of the Temple in San Francisco, and both you and Mukunda may bring up the Los Angeles to the same standard. Don't be depressed because there is no sufficient audience at present, but if you continue your service all in cooperation, in very near future it will be a nice center. Please offer my blessings to Sankarsana das, and Baladeva. and his daughter Haridasi, and etc.

Today we had a very nice lecture at the San Francisco State College; the attendance was very nice, and the meeting was successful, as it was in Los Angeles. They have arranged many other meetings also which I shall attend one after another.

Regarding the casting of Sri Sri Radha Krishna: As soon as the statues are finished, I shall send it for casting, at least one pair. And as soon as you receive this statues, please do the needful.

If Dayananda has left for Florida, please send me his address there. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
