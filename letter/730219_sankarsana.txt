My dear Sankarsana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 26th. and have noted the contents carefully. All of your programs sound very pleasing to me and I request that you write and consult with Visnu Jana Maharaja and the local GBC men, in order to bring about the realization of this proposal. I am here in Australia at the moment and will be returning to India by March 2nd. and then to America in mid-April, and I hope to see you then. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
