My dear Sri S.P. Mandelia:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 16, 1974 and I thank you very much for your invitation to the wedding of your son. I shall be very pleased to attend if I will be in Bombay during that time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
