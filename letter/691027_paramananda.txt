====== Paramananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Paramananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated October 21, 1969, and I am so glad to learn that a Krishna Conscious male child has been born now. His name should be Premananda Brahmacari. Premananda means one who is always absorbed in love of Krishna. So take care of this nice child and raise him along with the other boys in New Vrindaban so that a new generation of Krishna Conscious children will come out of this movement. Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Satyabhama Dasi. I hope this will meet you and your family in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
