====== Satsvarupa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 22, 1973.

You are the only one sending in reports, so I thank you very much for your diligence.

If you can arrange for meetings with Professor Dimock and other professors then do it for the month of October and I shall come.

Krishna is very kind upon you because he has given you so many responsible tasks. So always think of the Lotus Feet of Sri Krishna and you will find no difficulties in executing the tasks allotted to you by Krishna. Bhaktivinode Thakura used to say all difficult tasks he had to execute for Krishna were considered as great pleasure for him.

Regarding the criticism from others, that may be there but we have to follow our own principles. Syamasundara was too attached to his daughter and therefore he took her back, but it is not good.

Kindly see that the principles are being followed, deity worship, sankirtana, chanting etc. If we maintain these principles rigidly there is no question of fall down and without any difficulty our progressive march will advance.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
