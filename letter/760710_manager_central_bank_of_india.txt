Re: F.D.R. in name of Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, effected 4-3-76.

Dear Sir:

With reference to my letter to you dated June 12, 1976, I have received your replies dated May 3, 1976, and June 22, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care. Rather than pay interest from the fixed deposit receipt to the Vrinda Book Co., for the months of May, June, and July, 1976, you can rather pay the Vrinda Book Co. the interest for the months of March to June, 1976. Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
