Edinburgh, Scotland

My dear Kisora,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Edinburgh dated December %%_%% 1972, and I am so much pleased to hear from you again. Actually, I liked that place Scotland very much when I was there last time, and especially I saw that the Scotsmen were very much inclined toward our preaching, but the weather was for me unbearable. But I think by next summer they might have got a nice place in London, and because it is little warmer there, I may go and stay some time in London, and if there is opportunity I shall see Scotland temple also.

I am very glad to note that you are so much sincere and enthusiastic devotee of Krishna. That is wanted. If I do not do anything else, at least let me produce one such sincere devotee that's all. You are leader, so if you are enthusiastic then all of the others will remain always enthusiastic, that is your greatest qualification. And it is easy thing to maintain your enthusiastic behavior if you yourself and the rest devotees under your protection always without fail chant minimum 16 rounds daily, rise early in the morning for mangal arati, take bath, cleanse everything nicely, go out for preaching work, like that. In this way, if you stick tightly to the basic principles of devotional life as chalked out for us by our great predecessors, then always you will be feeling transcendental ecstasy of enthusiasm---that is Krishna Consciousness. It is very simple.

Yes, I have seen the press articles sent by yourself and Revatinandana, and I am very thankful to Revatinandana also for giving you all nice boys and girls the right instruction. I can understand that it may be sometimes difficult by material consideration for our preaching work there---I could not bear so much cold even in August---but because you are so much sincere to serve Krishna, never mind a little cold, what is that, only something touching my flesh, that's all---because you are thinking in this way and pushing on the mission of preaching work despite any conditions, therefore you are getting the best advantage of Krishna Consciousness movement. Because you have worked so hard for Krishna, making all sacrifice without any personal selfish motive, therefore you are making such nice advancement in spiritual life. Thank you very much for helping me in this preaching work. May Krishna bless you more and more.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
