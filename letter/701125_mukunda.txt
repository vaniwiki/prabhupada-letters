My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. After a long time I have receive your letter dated November 19th, 1970, as well as your telegram dated the 24th November, 1970. I thank you very much that you have sent the memorandums etc.

Hansadutta, Syamasundara and Tamala Krsna are detained here because we are trying to establish a center in Bombay. In the meantime, if you and your wife, Janaki, may take the place of Yamuna and Gurudasa and see that things are going on nicely there. London Temple is very important and things may not be neglected there.

Please see that KRSNA books are sold and the sales proceeds directly sent to Dai Nippon for credit of "Bhaktivedanta Book Fund". I have to pay still $10,000 to Dai Nippon for the order I have placed with them. The total amount was $35,000, out of which by collection from U.S.A. and something from my bank, we have paid $26,000, so another $10,000 is required. Please see that the book funds are immediately sent to Dai Nippon.

Please go on sending reports regularly and offer my blessings to your wife. I shall be glad to hear from her.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
