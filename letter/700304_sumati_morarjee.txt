Madam Sumati Morarji Baisaheba,

Please accept my greetings. I thank you very much for your letter dated 26 February, 1970, and noted the contents. You will be pleased to know that recently we have opened a center in Sydney. The newspaper-cutting is sent herewith.

I am also enclosing herewith a picture of the Deities in our London Temple. These Deities were donated by one London Devotee, Mr. Goyal, and they were purchased from Jaipur. The Deities contributed by Dalmia Jayan Trust and Birla Trust (5 Pairs) are made in Vrindaban, 24 inches high brass Deities, but these London Deities are made of first-class marble from Jaipur, and they are 42 inches high.

So any one of these patterns may be supplied by you, and I shall be glad if you kindly send me a list of prospective donors of such Deities from Bombay. There are many Vaisnava respectable gentlemen in Bombay, and they can cooperate with my mission.

For the present, I have a plan for opening 108 centers all over America, Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia. I have got at present 26 centers. I have sent some of my devotees in Germany where people are more interested in this Hare Krsna movement. You will be pleased to know that simply in Germany alone our "Hare Krishna Mantra" record has been sold to the extent of 57,000 copies.

You write to say that the copy of the letter addressed to Mr. Sharma was enclosed with my letter, but I do not find it. Anyway, I hope you have already instructed your Calcutta office to carry these Deities to different places of the U.S.A.

You will be pleased to know that my latest publication is "Sri Isopanisad" and I am sending one copy for your perusal. I hope you will feel interest in reading this book.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
