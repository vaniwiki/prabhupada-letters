To The Presidents of all centers in Europe and America:

The bearer of this letter, Sriman Ranajit Sene, is a life member of our Society. He is going to visit Europe and America, so he should be received in every center as a life member. If he wants to stay in the temple he should be given facility.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
