Dear Sir;

Since the founding of our Society in 1966, we have now got established over fifty centers and Radha Krsna Mandirs and they are registered in the major cities of the Western World.

Presently I am on tour with some of my foreign disciples in India and we have got a very large program here for preaching this Krsna Consciousness Movement or Bhagavata Dharma. Our program requires the assistance of both Sriman Wayne Gunderson and his wife Srimati Citralekha Devi Dasi, who are my initiated disciples. My request is that these two, husband and wife, be granted visa for coming to India. Our tour is lasting for another six months and their presence and assistance is immediately required. Please help them and expedite this matter as far as possible.

Thanking you in anticipation, I am,

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
