====== Satsvarupa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 12, 1969 and thank you very much. Regarding the delay in composing books, I have just now written to Pradyumna and Arundhati asking them the reason why they are delaying the matter. So on receipt of their clear reply I shall take necessary action. I can appreciate also that the matter is being delayed. If they are having difficulty in composing, can you suggest any other boy or girl to take up this work in Boston? Centralized activity is desirable, but because we have not got all workers in a place, there is difficulty. Now gradually it will be centralized.

So far as Krsna is concerned, I understand that you did not keep any copy of the manuscript. Generally it is the custom to make at least four copies, so how is it that you have neglected this? In the absence of a second copy it is risky to send you our copy in the mail. Therefore, I am personally glancing over and putting the diacritic marks in the Sanskrit words. Besides that, one respectable friend has promised to get this printed immediately. In my previous letter I asked you to give quotation for this __Krsna__ book. The size should be 7" x 10". I understand that is the standard size of this kind of book. Please also inform me if we have got arrangement for printing color pictures also. So in consultation with Advaita please give me immediately the actual expenditure for printing 10,000 __Krsna__ books on the style of __TLC__; four hundred pages, including fifty color pictures. It is essential for me to know this because the friend who wants to publish this book should be informed about the cost of production within a week. Also, I have not received any edited versions of the tapes which I have sent you from Europe. So please send them to me as soon as possible, keeping carbon copies with you in Boston. If there are discrepancies in your editing techniques between the beginning and later chapters, please inform me what they are so we can make the corrections here.

Regarding Brahmananda, I do not think he may divert his attention to Boston activities. So far I get report from Tamala Krishna, New York is not in proper condition. New York is the most important center, so things should be arranged there very first class. Brahmananda is leading very nice Sankirtana Party in New York, so that should be organized more and more. I shall write to Brahmananda soon. In the meantime, if you meet, you can also say to him. So far as press management is concerned, do you think Brahmananda's presence is required? Or will Advaita and Uddhava be able to do things? So far as I get report from Tamala, the press arrangement is now in due order trough the endeavor of Advaita and Uddhava. So Tamala Krishna will correspond with you in this connection. In the meantime you can send me the production cost of __Krsna__ as described above. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
