Vrindaban

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 9, 1972, wherein you have told me the water from the well is sweet. That is very good news. Now erect one large tank, similar to the one in front of Vrindaban station. Pump the water into the tank and store it. Water in Vrindaban, if it is sweet, it is very digestive, and simply by drinking water one becomes healthy. So far the sign is concerned, you can call our place the ISKCON Krsna-Balarama Temple.

Regarding the Cox and Kings proposal, that is very nice. I have no idea about Haridwar and Hrshikesa. I think Acyutananda was there, along with Harivilasa. But our point is that the tourists may concentrate in Vrindaban with us, live with us, and learn from us the spiritual life. What is the use of wandering here and there, simply seeing this and that and going home? Our main business is to teach them Krishna Consciousness. Yesterday I have met with George Harrison and his wife in their place at Henley, and they are both very much favorable. They want to stay with us for some time at Radha-Damodara Temple this winter sometime, I will tell you when.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
