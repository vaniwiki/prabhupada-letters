Dear Sir:

On April 21, 1976, I advised you the following: "The monthly interest accrued from the Fixed Deposit Receipt in the name of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust may be transferred to Vrinda Book Co. account with your branch for the 3 months of May, Jun, and Jyly of 1976, unless otherwise directed." I sent one copy to the Vrinda Book Co., and the original was sent to you. To this day, I have been recently informed that this order has not been executed. I want that this be executed immediately and also that you inform me accordingly at my New York return address promptly as the delay in executing this order.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
