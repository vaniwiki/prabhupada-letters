My dear Acyutananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 25th, and I have noted the contents.

It appears there is good chance we may get permission for our men to enter Jagannatha Puri temple if we can present the right documents. My idea is that you present the enclosed statement proving our men are bona fide Hindus to Swami Cinmayananda who you say is sympathetic to us on this point. Have him copy this statement on his own letterhead and sign it. In addition, take a similar signed certificate from Mr. Sujya Narayana Rajooa who is the Endowment minister of Andra Pradesh and who came to receive us at Tirumala. I think with signed statements from these two this will be enough and that we do not have to get the government sanction. So if you can take these statements from these two men it will be an important achievement for our society. Try for it in earnest and Krsna will help you.

I am glad to hear the Hyderabad temple is so enthusiastic for preaching. Please keep me informed.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
