<card class="letter">
Nairobi

My dear Shaktimati dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10-3-76, and I have noted the contents with care. It is best that you stay there in Nairobi. There you have your family, and you can assist in the activities of the Nairobi Temple. If there is any further question in this connection, Brahmananda Maharaja is there and he can further direct you. So far your daughter's marriage is concerned, I have no business. I cannot negotiate marriage. That is impossible. Neither there is any need for her to be sent to India. So you continue there in Nairobi, and take direction from Brahmananda Swami, that will be best. Try to remain always engaged in Krishna's service.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
