My dear Sri Joshi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 6, 1975 and your invitation to come to your house. I thank you very much for it, and shall be please to come on July 19th. I shall be accompanied with up to six disciples.

I am starting for San Francisco tomorrow and shall be staying at our new temple located at 2334 Stuart St. Berkeley, Ca. You can come and see me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
