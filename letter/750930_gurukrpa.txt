My dear Gurukrpa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter addressed to Rupanuga das dated September 16, 1975 and have noted the contents. Why is there this politics? This is not good. If politics come, then the preaching will be stopped. That is the difficulty. As soon as politics come, everything is spoiled. In the Gaudiya Math the politics is still going on. My Guru Maharaja left in 1936, and now it is 1976, so after 40 years the litigation is still going on. Do not come to this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
