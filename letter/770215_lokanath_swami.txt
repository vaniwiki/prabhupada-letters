Dear Lokanath Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of February 14, and I am pleased to hear that you are now travelling in Burdwan and preaching in the villages.

You ask for further instructions and suggestions, and the main instructions are to go on, to push on and preach and distribute books. If possible you can also hold a festival which is also part of preaching. I will be looking forward to seeing you and your bullock cart party in Mayapur.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
