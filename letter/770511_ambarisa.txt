====== Ambarisa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Ambarisa,

Please accept my blessings. Perhaps you know that my health has not been so good recently. So I have journeyed to Risikesh, hoping to recover somewhat my strength. Here we have the best house and it is situated just on the side of the Ganges. It is very beautiful, with mountains, cool breezes and very nicely flowing Ganges River. All of the devotees say it is the nicest place that have seen in India.

Recently I have received some photographs of the Doll Exhibit which they have prepared in Los Angeles. From the photographs it appears that they have done everything very nicely. This idea of doll exhibitions to demonstrate our philosophy has long been proposed, and my Guru Maharaja was very keen to execute this idea. Therefore I am just trying to give some shape to what my Guru Maharaja wanted. There is a proposal to make a very grand exhibition in the capital of the country, Washington D.C. It is proposed to have a restaurant and bookshop attached, and everything will be held within a specially built building. Formerly you told me that whatever money you had, it is my money. Of course I do not take it as mine, but it is a fact that everything belongs to Krsna: "__isavasyam idam sarvam yat kinca jagatyam jagat__ [Īśo mantra 1]." I thing you can utilize some of your money to try to give some shape to this idea of a doll exhibit, restaurant, and bookshop. I have seen that in Washington so many tourists came daily to see the many monuments and museums. So why not let one of the museums be about Krsna. Everything should be done first-class, and I am suer that it will become the most popular place to visit in Washington. I shall be very glad to hear from you whether you think it is possible to execute such an ambitious project.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
