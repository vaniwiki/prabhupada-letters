Bloomington, Indiana

My dear Narottamananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 9, 1972, and I have noted with great pleasure that you are opening a new centre in Bloomington, Indiana. You are fixing up your new place very nicely, that will attract men to come there. But always remember that our first business is preaching and distributing literatures, never mind we have to live under a tree. But because the people of your country expect something, we must give them place, but preaching is our real business. Your programme for the university students is very very nice, try to do it seriously and with scholarly approach. Yes, your chief weapon will be prasadam, because everyone likes to eat nice foodstuffs and philosophy and other things will come gradually. In this way try to make many devotees, just like so many of you may top-grade disciples came from Buffalo university under direction of Rupanuga. Keep our standard Krishna Consciousness programme to the highest level by always without fail rising early, chanting 16 rounds, holding arati, going out for street sankirtana, reading books daily, distributing as many books as possible, like that, and in this way Krishna will give you all intelligence and facility for doing His work just to perfection. Thank you very much for helping me in this way.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
