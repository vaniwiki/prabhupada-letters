Dear Bhakti Pramode Puri Maharaja:

Please accept my obeisances. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 27, 1975 and have noted the contents. Yes, it is Bhagavan's special mercy upon me that I am getting such immense wealth. You will be pleased to know that my books are selling to the extent of one million of dollars per month. But this money is coming from the mlecchas and yavanas. That is the difficulty. This money is not coming from the brahmanas. Therefore I am afraid to contribute to you as you request. How shall I give to you and pollute you?

They are all mlecchas, and you are a rigid brahmana, pukkha. So how will you accept it? If you like, you can hand over the management charge of your temple, and my devotees will manage.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
