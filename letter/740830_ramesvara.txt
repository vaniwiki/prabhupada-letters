My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 20, 1974 and have noted the contents. I note that Gurukrpa Swami will pay Dai Nippon $150,000 at the end of September and you will pay the Mayapur-Vrindaban account after October 8, 1974. It is good that he will be sending his collections thereafter directly to my account here in India.

Your program for printing the Spanish literature is approved by me. Do it nicely.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
