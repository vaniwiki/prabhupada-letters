My dear Kim;

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your recent letter, undated.

I am very glad to know that you are chanting 'Hare Krishna' and reading my books. Also that you are a good artist. This is our principle, whatever talent we have we shall engage it in Krishna's service. In that way Krishna will be satisfied and thereby we will also be satisfied.

The best way to make advancement in Krishna consciousness is by the association of advanced devotees. The best thing is if you can move into our temple in Minneapolis. Just as you have become Krishna conscious by the association of other devotees, similarly by your association gradually your parents will come to appreciate the philosophy of Krishna consciousness. Give them Prasadam and encourage them to read our books, and if you can, get them to chant 'Hare Krishna.' In any case whether you are able to live in the temple or not, you can always go on chanting 'Hare Krishna' and in that way gradually your life will become perfect.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
