Vrindaban

My dear Aksayananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. We have just come from Fiji Island where we are about to build our first temple outside India. This Krishna Kaliya Temple will be in many respects similar to the Vrindaban Temple as regarding the architectural work. Therefore, I am requesting you to make photos of the altars, and give detailed dimensions of the same, as well as the Vyasasana. Also take photos of the area outside the altar from where people will view the Deities. These items and others requested by the devotees in Fiji should be sent to them directly so that they can go ahead unimpeded in the construction of the new temple. Please do this immediately. The address in Fiji is

Mr. Deoji Punja (Vasudeva das Adhikari)\\
P.O. Box 125,\\
Lautoka, Fiji Island

Thank you very much. I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
