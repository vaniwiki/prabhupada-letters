====== Abhirama ======

<card class="letter">
Coconut Grove, Florida

My dear Abhirama das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 7, 1975 and have noted the contents. I have accepted the ten persons whom you have recommended for second initiation and their threads have been enclosed along with mantra sheet. I have also accepted the three you have recommended for first initiation. Their names are: William---Isa das, Eric---Ahobala-Nrsimha dasa, Nancy---Nartaka Gopala dasi. Their beads may be chanted on by Kirtanananda Svami.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enc: 7 threads and mantra sheet.

N.B. You must make sure that all of these devotees are following the regulative principles very nicely. Everyone must rise early, take bath attend mangala arati, chant at least 16 good rounds, attend class, and follow the four regulative principles strictly. If these things are lax, then there is no question of spiritual life. Any one who does not accept these things staunchly will have to fall down. You must teach them by your own personal example otherwise how will they learn. If you are loose in your habits, then everyone in your temple will also be loose in their habits. So, as one of my elder disciples, be strong. Do not deviate and you will be blessed.
