<card class="letter">
My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one letter from Guyana, and one gentleman, Sriman Petambar Dindayal is very much interested in our Krishna Consciousness movement. He has invited me to go there, so first of all I want to send him some various literatures and pamphlets about our society. So you please send him some Back To Godheads, our new prospectus, and press cuttings, etc. which will be of good information for him. Also, please send here to Los Angeles some of the new prospectus, a good amount, as they are very nice.

Hoping you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
