====== Sousilya (Stuart Rose), Gadagraja (Eugene Baum), Dayala Candra (David Peterson) ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Sons,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Brihaspati I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

__Stuart Rose__---Sousilya Das

__Eugene Baum__---Gadagraja Das

__David Peterson__---Dayala Candra Das

I am so glad to learn that all of you have been such a great help to Brihaspati there in our St. Louis Center. I can understand that all of you are very sincere boys and are very eligible candidates for going back to Home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
