My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 2nd June, 1970. Gargamuni has said that he has received a check for $100. If you think that the marriage ceremony of Rudra Das should take place, I have nothing to say on this decision.

So far opening of a branch in Chicago, this is a very encouraging proposal, but I think before opening a center we must be confident that things will go on nicely. Chicago is a very important place, and we need a strong man to manage affairs there. So I think if you personally can stay there for some time to arrange things it will be very nice. Best thing will be to consult Rupanuga, and whatever you do by mutual agreement that is accepted by me.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
