My dear Audulamidasa,

Please accept my blessings. It is great offense to change dress now that you have taken babaji dress you must continue. You are all so restless and take everything as farce. Now, take more rest and go on with your program of chanting and that will be good for you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
