My dear Ajita das,

Please accept my blessings. I am due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 27th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding dishonest means being used I have never advised or taught anyone like that. That is not my idea. This record distribution has caused havoc. It should be stopped immediately. I have also asked Hansadutta to stop it. Book distribution is our real business. If we give them a record, they simply hear some magical sounds and take it for sense gratification, but if they receive one of our books and read even one page, they get eternally benefited. Therefore I am stressing this book distribution, not other things. Stop record selling completely. This is my order.

I have accepted Gauracanda dasa brahmacari and Sriharini devi dasi as duly twice-born brahmanas and their threads are enclosed along with mantra sheet. You can hold a fire sacrifice and let them hear the mantra through the right ear from the tape of myself saying it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
