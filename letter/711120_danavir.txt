====== Danavir ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Danavir,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of November 12, 1971, and have noted the contents with encouragement. But one thing, what do you mean Gaura Hari was held in jail? Please convey my blessings to Mrs. Dossa. Her husband was a very great devotee who was taken away by Krishna for promotion, and she may rest assured that he has progressed on the path of going back to Home, back to Godhead. She should follow in her good husbands footsteps and become fully Krishna Conscious and in this way she will find herself fully happy. You must give her good guidance and all facility in this respect.

I am very pleased that you are making arrangements for the 1st ANNUAL PUSPABHISHEKA YATRA PARADE AND FESTIVAL, 1971, and if he is free to come, Visnujana Swami may come to lead the kirtana and preaching. That is a good proposal. Krishna was just a toy in the hands of the Gopis, so one day the Gopis decided that we shall decorate Him. Pusyabhisheka means a ceremony to decorate the deity profusely with flowers, ornaments, cloths. After there should be lavish feasting and a procession through the streets, so that all the citizens should see how beautiful Krishna appears.

As soon as He is prepared, Lord Jagannatha may come there to live. Someone like Karandhara who is experienced may install the deity nicely. It is very nice that you have won the favor of Srimati Tulasi Devi, and that she is prospering under your careful attention. That is a good sign.

I hope this meets you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
