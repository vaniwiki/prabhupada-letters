My Dear Ranadhir, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10th October, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. In my opinion Hayagriva should maintain New Vrindaban. As an ideal grihasta he should spend at least 50% of his income for New Vrindaban. So if he has got money, you should not ask other centers for maintenance of the cows.

Things are coming along nicely in London, and last week we were granted permission by the authorities to occupy the building at 7, Bury Place. So more and more Krishna is giving us facilities to push on this Krishna Consciousness throughout the world. Tonight there is to be held an engagement at Conway Hall in London, and in previous engagements I have marked that many of the English are very intelligent and nicely disposed toward our movement. By the Grace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the boys and girls of the Western countries are eagerly accepting this Samkirtan Movement and gradually making perfection in their lives. You are a sincere soul, so continue to chant Hare Krishna the prescribed number of rounds, depending on Krishna in all instances, and surely He will be pleased to bestow His blessings upon you. Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
