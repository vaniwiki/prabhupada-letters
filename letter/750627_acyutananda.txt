My dear Acyutananda Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 5, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the question of New Vrindaban that should be referred to Kirtanananda Swami who can deal with it directly.

I am glad to hear that your Bangalore program was a success. Your question of how did Sukdev Goswami hear Srimad-Bhagavatam, it was in the womb of his mother.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
