Mayapur

Dear Sri Kamal Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. In reply to your Bengali letter registered posted to Delhi, I have advised the president of the Mayapur center to do the needful. The copy is enclosed and you can see personally.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
