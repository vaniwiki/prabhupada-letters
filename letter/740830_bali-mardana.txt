My dear Bali Mardan das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 15, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding the illegal taking of the Japanese currency from the country, do not do these things. Also stop the pen stealing. This is not good, and should be stopped. Regarding Ādi lila Chapter 6 and balance of Chapter 5 that has been sent with Bhakta das, so I have been informed. A portion of the Madhya lila has also just now been posted.

Regarding Karandhara, he has already been informed that I have accepted his resignation from BBT. It is all right that Tamala Krsna borrows $10,000 for a bus and that Chicago borrows $10,000 to purchase their present building.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
