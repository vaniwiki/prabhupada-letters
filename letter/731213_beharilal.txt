<card class="letter">
My dear Beharilal,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated November 8, 1973 just now received by me as it was redirected from India.

I have not received any reply from Tusta Krsna Swami to my letters. I do not know why he has left New Zealand. In Hawaii a great wrong doing has been done by Gaurasundara and Siddha-svarupa. They sold the temple and went away with all the money without taking any permission from me. It is a fall down on their parts. They have done the wrong thing. You should not go to Hawaii to join them. Stay in New Zealand and work cooperatively with Madhudvisa Swami. The "communal form of Krsna Consciousness" which you mention is not approved by me. It is all concoction. My Guru Maharaja condemned this practice. We must stay together and vigorously preach the Krsna Consciousness philosophy to the world. That is the real spirit of Lord Caitanya's Movement. Do not fall victim to this sentimental idea of peaceful life in seclusion. That is not our dharma.\\
I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
