====== Satsvarupa ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Satsvarupa,

This morning I have sent you one note of the tape regarding Pradyumna's hospital bill. I think I shall be able to send you $500.00 from this centre. I understand that Hospital bills are also paid by small installments. We have to make arrangement for future emergency and I wish to organize a central board for such management. For me it is not possible to look after the administrative affairs. Some of you should form a committee for this kind of management. In India the Brahmacaris collect alms and subscription But here it is not possible to do like that: therefore all Brahmacaris may work at least part time so that our financial difficulty may be minimized.

Yours, etc.
