My dear Ravindra Svarupa das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 22, 1975 with enclosed clipping. It is a very important article. The magistrate has given a very good judgement in our favor and a very good certificate that this is bona fide religion. I have given the clipping for publishing in our "Back to Godhead" magazine.

Yes, I am coming to your city on Friday morning July 11, 1975 from Chicago. I look forward to meeting the professors. July 15 is all right, as I may be going to San Francisco on Wednesday, July 16.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
