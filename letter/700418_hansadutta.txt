====== Hansadutta ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12th April, 1970, and the information is very encouraging. The more you worship the Deity very nicely, all of you will feel very nice and peaceful spiritually. Therefore this point should be very much carefully attended.

Similarly in London Yamuna is also doing nicely, and all the wives of our students should be especially trained up for Deity worship and cooking, and when possible they should go outside on Sankirtana Party with their husbands and others.

I am glad that you have advised Berkeley to send me $1,500 which I hope I will receive very soon. It will be a great help. Recently I have paid out of my book fund $11,500 for purchasing the church and $2,500 for printing __Krishna Consciousness: the Topmost Yoga__ book, so $14,000 has been drained out and it must be filled up as soon as possible. The next big payment for KRSNA will be about $20,000. Now we have to make brihat mrdanga propaganda along with Sankirtana Party. Please organize to translate all our literatures into German language through our expert students. As you have got some rudimentary knowledge in German, try to make it more perfect so that you can see how things are going on.

Regarding Krishna das's marriage with Heidi, it cannot take place. From hygienic point of view, the boy should be at least five years older than the girl. If the boy is weaker, then the progeny will be weaker sex or females and the man will get still weaker. So Krishna das may not be married immediately because he is too young and he can wait even up to five years and become a strong brahmacari. But if a suitable girl is there, not more than 15 to 16 years old or utmost 17 years, he can be married to her. I think he should wait for his marriage.

In the meantime, find out some other boy for Heidi, she should be married immediately. I am glad that she is a good translator, and let her be blessed by translating our literatures.

I have received the letters of Neal, Heidi, and Stephanie, and their beads have arrived today. I have duly chanted their beads and will return them by separate post. At the time of initiation, it is incumbent that the disciple should collect some alms and offer it to the Spiritual Master.

Please offer my blessings to Himavati for her nice engagement, and be happy in advancing Krishna Consciousness.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
