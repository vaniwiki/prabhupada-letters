My dear Srutakirti das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter, hand-delivered, dated March 5, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

I have received one letter from our Ambarisa das. He is presently in Boston living at the following address: Alfred Ford, 124 Chandler St. #5, Boston, Mass. 02116, U.S.A. He is very eager to open another restaurant there in Boston. Boston is a very good city for there are many, many young people and a Hare Krishna Restaurant where we serve delicious Prasadam will be appreciated there. So there is some disagreement that you are having there in Hawaii so better that you immediately go to Boston and work with Ambarisa das to open another successful restaurant.

I hope that this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
