My dear Rupanuga, Bhagavan das, and Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1st June, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. The preface to the enlarged edition of Bhagavad-gita As It Is was sent to you long ago, from Australia. It was sent on 12th May, 1971 and you should have received it by now. I do not know why it is missing. So I am enclosing a second copy herewith.

Regarding press matters, whatever you GBC men decide amongst yourselves I have no objection, but economically the press operation must be sound. Formerly it was contemplated that the press would charge 10% of the total costs for maintenance of the press. Maintenance cost is $1,500 per month. So that means $15,000 worth of books must be produced each month. And this $15,000 is our cost, not the face value of the books. So if you can produce books in this manner, then it is all right. But past experience has proved otherwise.

It appears that Dai Nippon quoted for Bhagavad-gita $23,000. and ISKCON Press quoted $20,000. So $3000 difference. But if the book fund has to maintain the press expenditure by $1,500 per month and the printing takes two years, then what becomes the total cost of Bhagavad-gita As It Is?

I think the book fund can maintain only 10% of the books produced. That will be economical. Otherwise, whatever GBC members decide, I have nothing to disagree with. But economically the existing proposal is not very sound. Books must be produced to the extent of $15,000 per month and then it is all right.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
