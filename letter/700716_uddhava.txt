====== Uddhava ======

My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. Sometimes I am asked for my glossy photo by some friends, but I have none here. Therefore I shall be glad if you kindly send the following glossy by return mail. (These photos will also be used for printing in various Indian papers and magazines as they are requesting. So they must be of good propaganda quality.)

Subject\\
Prabhupada (alone prefered.)\\
Exterior view of L.A. Temple\\
Deities and altars (very opulent)\\
Scenes of Rathayatra and other festivals\\
Cow protection in New Vrndavana\\
(pictures in Handbook of milking, and calf)\\
Some important members (alone or together)

Thank you very much. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
