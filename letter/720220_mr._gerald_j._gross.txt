Dear Mr. Gross,

I have received your letter dated December 30, 1971, addressed to me to my Madras residence. I thank you very much for the same. The Japanese quotation for printing my __Bhagavad-gita__ complete edition is already there, and I think nobody can compete with their price in any part of the world. The best advice I can give you is therefore to get the book printed in Japan immediately.

In the meantime I am very much pleased to inform you that there is very good demand in India for the small edition of my __Bhagavad-gita__ published by you. Unfortunately, stocks are not available here in India. I understand that you have got your appointed agents here in india, namely "India Book House." They have got their office in Warden Road, a few blocks from our Temple in Bombay on the same road. I went there personally to inquire whether they have got the book in stock, but they had no stock. So I shall request you to immediately send stock of my __Bhagavad-gita__ already published in sufficient numbers so that we can inform our thousands of devotees and Indian customers to take supply from your agents here.

I shall be very much glad to hear from you in this connection, both to my Calcutta address (as above) and Bombay address (as above), as early as possible. I shall remain in Calcutta until 1st March, and from there I shall go to Bombay for another two weeks or so.

Kindly treat this matter as urgent and do the needful.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
