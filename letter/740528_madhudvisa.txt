====== Madhudvisa ======

<card class="letter">
Melbourne

My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have heard that you are very keen to make the Melbourne Rathayatra very wonderful and you have requested extra instructions. One thing is there are many band parties---if you can get band parties to join that would be nice. Our men should hold kirtana just in front of the ratha, and other parties may proceed before us.

I think we will accept your invitation to join us when we break our journey to Melbourne by stopping somewhere in Malaysia, probably Jakarta, where you say we have good friends who would like to accommodate us with a place to stay. We shall inform you positively of the date of arrival there when we receive our tickets from you in Paris and confirm the flight. So I think we shall arrive in Melbourne no later than the 26th of June.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
