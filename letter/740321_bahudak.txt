Dear Bahudak,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted for first initiation the following devotee recommended by you:

David McLeod---Devagiri das\\
You may send his beads to be chanted on by Jagadisa. Be sure to instruct him in the avoidance of the ten offenses and how he has now vowed in all seriousness never to fall down on the four sinful activities.

I have also accepted one devotee, Prabhupada dasa Adhikari, for second initiation, upon your recommendation. Please impress on him that this second initiation is not awarded cheaply or automatically, and that he must be very strict in following the regulative principles of bhakti yoga. I am enclosing a sacred thread and gayatri mantra. Have him hear the tape of me chanting in the right ear. I have also accepted Riddha das Brahmacari for second initiation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
