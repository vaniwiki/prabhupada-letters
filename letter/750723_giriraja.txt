Bombay

My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed find a copy of my letter to Bank of America, Bombay. Please take this copy to the Manager and see whether they have made the Fixed Deposit in the name of Bhaktivedanta Book Trust.

Also send me a report of the Bombay affairs. You should send reports regularly. Copies of your letters may be sent to Los Angeles and New York during the next thirty days as I will be touring.

I also request you to send me an account statement of Bank of America A/c No. 16026 International Society for Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
