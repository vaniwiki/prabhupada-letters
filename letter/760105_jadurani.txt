My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your undated letter along with enclosed sketches. The sketches are all alright as they are. Please go ahead and make the paintings.

Yes, if Lord Visnu appeared as a Saivite then He must have Saivite tilaka. The brahmanas in Krishna lila should have shaved heads and sikhas.

Since there is no longer such a rush for printing, you may once again send sketches for my approval. Thank you for organizing the art department.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
