====== Yasomatinandana ======

<card class="letter">
Vrndavana

Dear Yasomatinandana, Pranava

and Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. Our deity installation ceremony is to be held on the 20th and the function was to begin three days before, namely, the 17th of April. So, instead of the 17th, you can make it the 16th. That will satisfy everyone. Srimad Bhimasena Vedacarya may be informed in this way and do the needful. Please let me know the result at Hyderabad by phone or if somebody is coming there, through him.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
