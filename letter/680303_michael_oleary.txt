My dear Michael O'Leary,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 27, 1968, and I thank you very much for it. I am especially happy to hear your statement, "I have taken to the process of chanting Hare Krishna---feeling the results immediately." This is very good. Please continue to chant, and execute your duties with thoughts and words of Krishna, and you will be happy always.

Please try to follow the rules and regulations, and when I arrive in New York, we can talk together, and as you feel yourself ready, you can be initiated. If you have any doubts or questions, your good God-brothers are always ready and willing to help you. Brahmananda can give you the lists of the qualifications for devotees, and the 10 offenses, and other informations as you may need. If you have got any questions, please feel at liberty to write to me about them as you desire. I am also very happy to learn you are a sculpture student; at the present time, I am trying to carve out of wood Sri Radha and Krishna Murti. If you can carve out these Deities, it will be very nice.

I shall be looking forward to meeting you when I shall return to N.Y. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
