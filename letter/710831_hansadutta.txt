====== Hansadutta ======

<card class="letter">
Hamburg

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two letters dated 27th and 28th August, 1971 respectively and have noted the contents. In one letter you decide to close Hamburg center and in the next letter you change your decision. So my decision is that, at any cost, Hamburg center must be maintained and you cannot go to nightclubs.

Going to nightclubs will deteriorate the quality of our transcendental chanting. Please do not do this. Stick to Hamburg temple and maintain it somehow or other. Of course touring from city to city is nice program, but not in the clubs. Our only program should be having Sankirtana on the streets and if somebody calls then at the home, and we should distribute our literatures. You say that there is a very good demand for Isopanisad, German edition, so why not stress on selling this book and maintain in that way? And if it is a burden that the rent of the temple is too high then you can reduce the size of the temple and Himavati may be fixed up for worshiping the Deity. So make your plans accordingly.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
