My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 14, 1972 and I have noted the contents. Now I am in Los Angles and everything is going very nicely here. I think that you may also come here and see me. Rupanuga, Satsvarupa, and Bali Mardan are coming here also, at least before the 27th of this month because I am giving them the sannyasa order of life on that date along with Karandhara?. However, there is certainly no urgency for taking sannyasa. But if my senior disciples wish to take sannyasa then I shall give it. But there is no urgency. Still, you may come as there are many things which we may discuss concerning GBC and other activities. Now I want to retire, and you all appointed GBC men must do the work that I am doing. Therefore, I have recommended this traveling extensively for the GBC men, just as I am doing it. If I did not travel there would be no nice organization. Traveling and preaching, that is the Sankirtana movement. But now I am old man; let me retire for writing books in my last years.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
