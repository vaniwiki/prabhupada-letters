My dear Tejyas das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 11th, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care.

If you can arrange with Gopala Krishna then I have no objection to you increasing your preaching activities there. If Gopala Krishna wants to be interim president, then if that is your "mutual" arrangement, then you can do more preaching work, especially to the government officers. I was very pleased to see how you are getting top-ranking men to read my books. That is real preaching. If all the government officers at least purchase some of our books, it will be a great credit so do it very nicely.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. The mentioned how the programs are being well attended at the new centre in New Delhi, so when I stay in Vrindaban, we can arrange meetings with important government officials at our new centre and I can come for the weekend and return to Vrindaban. New Delhi is the most important place for preaching to the leaders of India.\\
