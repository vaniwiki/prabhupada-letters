====== Sumati Morarjee ======

<card class="letter">
Madam Sumati Morarji Baishaheba,

Please accept my greetings and all blessings of Lord Krishna. I am in due receipt of your letter of July 12, 1967. I have advised my disciples to Publish your advertisement in the __Back to Godhead__ free of charges.

I am feeling too much to return to Vrindaban at the lotus feet Vrindaban Behari Lord Krishna; and therefore I have decided to return to India immediately. I would have liked to return via sea, as you have so kindly offered me passage in your letter, but in my precarious state of health that is not possible. So by the mercy of Krishna and through one friend here, somehow or other, I have received air passage, and I am expecting to leave here for New Delhi on Saturday next, reaching Palam Airport on the 24th instant at 7:30 a.m. From there I shall proceed to Vrindaban after a few days rest in Delhi.

I can understand that at present you cannot allow free passage to my disciples. But if you don't do so, at least in the near future, then my mission will be half finished or failure. I am just enclosing one letter of appreciation for one of my principal students (Bruce Scharf) from Professor Davis Herron, and another letter from Professor Roberts of New York University. I think these letters will convince you how much my movement of Krishna Consciousness is taking ground in the western world. The Holy Name of Hare Krishna is now being chanted not only in this country but also in England, Holland and Mexico, that I __know__ of. It may be even more widespread. I have sent you one gramophone record which I hope you may have received by this time. You will enjoy to learn how Krishna's Holy Name is being appreciated by the Western World.

Therefore it is a need that this movement must be spread all over this country. It is glorious for India and glorious for Hindu Religion. Please therefore fully cooperate with me. For the present, at least two of my disciples must come to India to assist me there both for the sake of my health and for the editorial work of __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ I request you therefore instead of free passage to me, please allow one of my chief disciples, Sriman Hayagriva Brahmacari, (Mr. Howard Wheeler M.A.), free passage to India and another disciple, who takes my personal care, half-fare. For future you may consider later on.

The whole idea is that due to my indifferent health in this old age, it may be that I may not come back again. But I must train up at Vrindaban some of my disciples. I can very well spread up this missionary work without any personal transfer. Please therefore cooperate with me as far as possible for Krishna's sake.

You will be glad to learn that centers at the following places are going in full swing: (1) New York; (2) Montreal, Canada; (3) San Francisco; and the following centers are going to be opened at the following places within the next several months: (1) Boston; (2) Washington, D.C. (3) Vancouver, Canada; (4) Los Angeles; and (5) New Mexico (Santa Fe).

Some of my friends in India are sending Sri Murtis (Radha-Krishna), and we are getting locally sculpted Jagannatha, Balavadra, and Subhadra Murtis to install in the temples. The societies are being worshiped with flowers and fruits, and Kirtana is being performed both morning and evening, and Srimad-Bhagavatam is being recited. Don't you think that this movement is glorious both for India and the world? Kindly, therefore cooperate with me in full heart.

I shall anxiously await your reply, which please address to:

Copy may also be sent to New York.
