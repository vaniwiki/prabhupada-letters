====== Whom it may concern ======

<card class="letter">
To whom it may concern:

It is a great pleasure for me that Dr. S.R. Chakravarti has sung some important verses from Srimad-Bhagavatam, now made into a record album. I have heard these songs and am confident that anyone who will listen to these nice songs will be inclined to read my complete translation of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, now available in English (60 volumes), which has been published by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in Los Angeles, U.S.A.

Faithfully,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
