Dear Balavanta,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted the devotees for first initiation according to your recommendations, and their spiritual names are as follows:

Gene Johnson---Jvarajit dasa

Ron Brunch---Ramanotsuka dasa

Elaine Magyer---Titiksa devi dasi\\
You may send their beads to Rupanuga Maharaja for chanting. Instruct them carefully in avoiding the ten offenses, and make sure that they and everyone in the temple is chanting at least 16 rounds daily, without fail.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
