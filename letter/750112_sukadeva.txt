My dear Sukadeva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 25, 1976 and have noted the contents. I have also just received one letter from Gandharva das. I have requested him to come to India and live with me for some time. I think that will solve this problem.

Please set a strong example of Krishna Consciousness for all the devotees there who are under you care.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
