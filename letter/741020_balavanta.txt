My dear Balavanta das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 5, 1974 and have noted the contents. For naming your temple, our New Navadvipa is already there, and Navadvipa is the same as Mayapur. So your temple shall be named New Panihati. Panihati is the place where Gaura Nitai would assemble for Sankirtana performance and where Raghunath das Goswami supplied a big feast of prasadam for all the devotees.

The book distribution should not be curtailed. You can first have a little chanting, then book distribution; but book distribution is also chanting.

Upon your recommendation I accept the following as my initiated disciples and their names are: John Johnson---Jitakrodha dasa; Susan Neuoff---Surasa dasi; and Cindy Sacco---Svaha dasi. I also accept Naradi devi dasi for second initiation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
