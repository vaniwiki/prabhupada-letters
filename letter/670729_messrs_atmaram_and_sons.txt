Dear Sir:

I beg to inform you that I have come back from the U.S.A. in an unwell condition; therefore I cannot come to see you personally at the present time. But I request you to send me a statement of account at my Vrindaban address listed above.

Furthermore, I request you not to pay anything more to Candra Shekhar. Please send the check crossed account payee.

Thanking you.

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
