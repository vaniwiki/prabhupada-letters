====== Subala ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Subala,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter of April 30, 1968, and noted the contents. So your duty as you are doing, even nobody is coming in morning, Lord Jagannatha will hear your kirtana, because we are always in company with the Lord of the Universe. But I think Krishna has sent you one nice boy to help you. Please try to convince him rightly about the philosophy of Krishna consciousness and read Srimad-Bhagavatam and other literatures, from Back to Godhead, and I think this boy will be helpful to your activities there.

So far changing the place; we must give first consideration to the right place, not to the rent. Even the rent is high, we shall first pay for a place where many people come and go. Our New York center and San Francisco center is well situated because many newcomers pass through the street in front of the temple. Similarly if the present place is better, you may not change to other place for cheaper rent. Please try to convince that college boy who is coming and I hope he will be very much helpful to your activities.

Hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
