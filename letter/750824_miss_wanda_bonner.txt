Dear Miss Bonner:

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 20, 1975 and have noted your problems. My suggestion is that you please chant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare; Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. This maha mantra cleanses the dust from the mirror of the mind and awakens us to a pure life of devotional service to the Lord, free from all anxieties.

You can discuss further your problems with Gunagrahi das Adhikari, the President of our San Diego center.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
