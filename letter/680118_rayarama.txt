====== Rayarama ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter of Jan. 11, 1968, and have noted the contents carefully. I acknowledge receipt of Kirtanananda's sannyasa certificate. I have no objection to the sweatshirts and posters bearing Madhava Visnu. And I am glad to hear that Back to Godhead will soon be ready for selling.

__Bhagavad-gita__ is nearing completion---I heard this before I started from India. The editing has been too much delayed. Now I request you to come here for a week with the full manuscript so that I can see it personally, along with you, and finish the editorial work, within a week. Even after signing the contract, if the manuscript is not submitted, it is regrettable. If it is not inconvenient for you, somehow or other, it will be better if you come here for one week absolutely for this purpose so that we can finish this job without further delay. If need be, it can be retyped also here. We have got two nice girl typists. I wished that the editorial department should be combinedly worked but it has not been successful. You are overloaded with so many works therefore it is being delayed; I can understand this. Therefore, I wish that you may come here for a week, suspending all other business and finish this __Bhagavad-gita__ in my presence.

Hope you are feeling well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please inform Brahmananda & Jayananda that I have received their letters & it will be duly replied.
