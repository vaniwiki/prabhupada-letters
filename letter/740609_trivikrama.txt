<card class="letter">
Taipei, Taiwan

My dear Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of May 25th, received in Paris.

You send both good and bad news. It is very good that Taiwan is proving a good place for Krsna Consciousness, in that you report many Chinese boys are coming and that you have been given a nice place to operate a center. Unfortunately three men have left you and now there is only you and Dvija hari. I can understand the boys who left you were not very steady. I have written to Yasodananda Swami who was thinking of travelling from Tokyo to come and join you there and also Gurukrpa Swami can come and go from Tokyo and try to help. I will soon be going to Australia (by June 25th) and when I see Madhudvisa Swami I shall ask him to consider if he can investigate your situation and send you brahmacaris as needed. We will also discuss Hong Kong, which as you mention, is also short of men. In the meantime, although you are only two you should carry on all your programs as far as possible. In the beginning I was only one and I started everything, so you have twice as many men. Trust in Krsna and simply dedicate your life to introducing the chanting of Hare Krsna and Krsna Consciousness philosophy to whomever you meet. Surely Lord Caitanya will be pleased by your effort there, and thus you will be eligible for his benediction which is to award love of Krsna.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
