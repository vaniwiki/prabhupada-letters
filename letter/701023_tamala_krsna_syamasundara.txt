====== Tamala Krsna, Syamasundara ======

<card class="letter">
Bombay

My dear Tamala Krsna and Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I hope you and your good wives as well as Srimat Sarasvati are all well. I have safely arrived in Amritsar and we are being very well cared for at the Vedant Niketan. The people and also the Sannyasis here are very much liking our Sankirtana Movement, so things are going on nicely.

I am very anxious to know your situation; whether you have removed to the Rama Temple or where you are stationed now?

What was the result of my application to the Buildings Society Cooperative? Please let me know.

Unless there is good reception for us arranged at Delhi and Vrndavana, we shall come back directly to Bombay as scheduled.

There was one manual typewriter left at Seksaria's house which was used for typing up the letters for inviting the press to the conference---please see that this machine is with you or ask Mr. Seksaria for it. Gurudasa has left the Movie projector with you at Mr. Lalan's house and also there were several silver bowls and one set of clothes for the Deities as well as their jewelry which was not packed up by Malati when I left Lalan's with Gurudasa. Please be sure that all these things are with you.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
