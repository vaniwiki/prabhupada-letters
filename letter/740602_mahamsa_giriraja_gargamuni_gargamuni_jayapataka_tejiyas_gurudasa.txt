My dear %%___%%,

Please accept my blessings. After meeting here in Geneva with Karandhara das Adhikari and several other GBC members, I have decided to send Karandhara to India to replace Tamala Krsna Goswami as the new Governing Body Commissioner for India. I know from experience that Karandhara is a highly qualified devotee and I feel confident in placing him in such an important position for our society as head of affairs in India. It is a great relief for me. Karandhara is very enthusiastic to begin his new assignment and will be leaving for India in a few days. Please give him all cooperation and work together for advancement of our mission to make the people of India Krishna Conscious.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
