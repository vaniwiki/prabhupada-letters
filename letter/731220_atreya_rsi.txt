Tehran

My dear Atreya Rsi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 2, 1973. Also, I have received the letter from Navayauvana along with the $150.00 daksina. I happily accept Navayauvana for second initiation. Enclosed find one sacred thread and one gayatri mantra sheet. You should hold a fire sacrifice amongst our members only, after which the initiate should listen to the gayatri mantra cassette tape which I have made once through the right ear. I hope that you are coming to our Mayapur festival March 1st to 8th. We are having a GBC meeting and your presence is required. After the Mayapur ceremony when I am coming to Europe, I will stop in Tehran for two or three days. Please offer my blessings to your wife, Navayauvana Prabhu, and all of the other devotees there.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
