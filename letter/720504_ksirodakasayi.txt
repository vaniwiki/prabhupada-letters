My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th April, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. It is good news that you have come to your senses that nothing should be done by contractor. Everything should be done by ourselves. Mr. Saraf is experienced, so take his help. So go on raising funds, constructing, and send me the plans as soon as possible. I have got some idea from Gurudasa' letter, and it sounds very, very nice.

So far Gargamuni is concerned, he'll not become president, I am requesting him to forget this idea. So do not become agitated in your mind. As Gargamuni supplies the money, you supply him with a full accounting. As things will be done by yourself and Gurudasa, you give him purchase bills and statements of account. I am asking him, he will send you money, and that money, along with whatever you raise, will be used for materials and constructing, you keep good accounts and send him regularly.

Full instructions for Hindi BTG is given herewith by Syamasundara, as we have gone to Dai Nippon personally today, so you read it carefully and do the needful. So far whatever BTG's you have printed in India, whatever has been issued to the centers, they must now pay you, you send them bills. I shall notify Calcutta and Bombay to pay you. 4,000, 5,000 copies each issue printed, where they have been distributed and how the money is being collected? There was some money with Radha Raman Goswami, whether he has paid it? So collect wherever you have given BTG's. I have given you Rs. 4000/- on BTG account. This must be returned and deposited in the Book Fund Account in Bombay.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
