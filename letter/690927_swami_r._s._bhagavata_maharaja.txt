====== Swami R. S. Bhagavata Maharaja ======

<card class="letter">
To His Holiness Swami R.S. Bhagavata Maharaja

Revered Sripada Bhagavata Maharaja,

Please accept my humble obeisances. I beg to inform you that in reply to your letter dated 8th August 1969, I sent my letter dated 21st August 1969 when I was in Los Angeles. Since then I have received no letter from you. I gave you my address in Germany, but I did not receive any letter there. So I am confused whether you have received my above letter or not. Anyway, now I am staying in England, a few miles from London, at the above address. I came to England on September 11th, 1969, and the reception was very pleasing. Perhaps you might have seen some of the pictures in Calcutta papers. I am sending herewith two pictures and newspaper reports for your reference.

In your letter dated 8th August 1969 you proposed to send a copy to Srimati Vinode Vani Dasi (Miss O.C. Powtell), Superintendent of your Vasudeva Gaudiya Math, London. Besides that, you invited me to talk with your Acarya of the Mission. Now I am staying here, and if you authorize your representative in London, Srimati Vinode Vani Dasi, to talk preliminarily, then I will welcome the idea. Anyway, I shall be very much pleased to receive your reply by return mail to my above London address.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
