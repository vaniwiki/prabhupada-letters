Dear Mr. Ogata:

Please accept my greetings. I hope this meets you in good health. I am writing after a long time. I used to send you Hindi composed papers, photo ready, adding to it some colored pictures. The cover types were also turned into Hindi reading. I would like to know if it is possible to print this Hindi magazine from your good press.

Kindly send quotation for 32 pages, simple black printing, and cover colored on four pages, same size as the Back to Godhead. Kindly send quotation for the minimum quantity you print, and what will be the charges F.O.B. India.

Faithfully yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
