My dear Mr. Mohapatra,

Please accept the blessings of Lord Krishna. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 21, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. Here in Mayapur we are trying to create a place of inspiration for people throughout the world. It is in Mayapur that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, appeared. This information comes to us from the Srimad-Bhagavatam.

> krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam
> sangopangastra-parsadam
> yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
> yajanti hi sumedhasah
> [SB 11.5.32]

"In this age of Kali those who are intelligent perform the congregational chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears in this age along with His associates to inaugurate the sankirtana movement, or chanting of the Holy Names. That incarnation is yellowish in hue." This description is there in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, and there are other references also in the Mahabharata, etc. This sankirtana of the Holy Names is the Yuga-dharma and all intelligent men will appreciate, as you are also appreciating the importance of this movement.

As you know March 16 is the birthday celebration of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and you are welcomed at any time to visit our centre in Mayapur. I thank you for your interest and look forward to your visiting our Mayapur centre with your family in the near future.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
