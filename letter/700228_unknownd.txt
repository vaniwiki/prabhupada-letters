to the international unabridged, the same principle is there. Similarly in mathematics beginning from 1,2,3, adding and subtracting, etc. up to higher mathematics, just like calculus, the 1,2,3, adding and subtracting is still there. But basic math taught to children and higher math to the college man. In this way by Krishna Consciousness we can solve all the dogmatic confusions and speculations. This is the greatest need of the human beings and please try to do it as far as possible and Krishna will help you. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
