My dear Ranadhira,

Please accept my blessings. We have received you letter dated 3/18/72 recommending Katila dasi for second initiation. Enclosed please find one copy of gayatri mantra. Hold a fire yajna and give gayatri mantra to her. Rupanuga has got a tape of me reciting gayatri mantra, so you can get a copy from him. One thing is that the tape should be heard through earphones into the right ear.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
