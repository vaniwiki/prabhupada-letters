Sri Sri Vaisnava Carane Dandavat nati Purvikiyam\\
I am offering my dandavat pranaamas to the Vaisnavas' lotus feet and then I am writing.

Sripad Narayana Maharaja,\\
Upon receiving your letter dated 13.11.66 I came to know of all the details. I became very sad upon hearing of Sripad Bhikhu Maharaja's untimely passing away. How such an active, steady, strong and young man's heart could fail is beyond my dreams. I am extremely sad. Moreover, he was a great helping hand for you. Everything is the desire of Krsna. I hope your health is better now.

There is no need to bother Sripada Tirtha Maharaja with the burden of any work. I sent him Rs 150/- eight months ago but so far it has not been possible for him to send anything. All are busy with their own work. In your previous letter I came to know that you are willing to help me, but from your current letter I see that this is difficult for you now. At present there is no need to send anything. Just deposit the Rs 1500/- in the Punjab National Bank. I am sending a letter in the name of the Bank Manager. Kindly deposit that money and the letter in Vrndavana. If they tell you to send the pass book and the checkbook please send on Regd. Airmail. Otherwise they can send them themselves.

A visit should also be made to the Gosvami of the Radha-Damodara Temple. I sent them two or three letters but have received no reply. The bank was to pay Rs 5/- per month. I am desirous to know if they are receiving this money, Kindly write me a letter after inquiring about this.

If Trivikrama Maharaja can send a mrdanga and karatalas from Navadvipa that is good. Otherwise I do not want to trouble you only for a mrdanga (khola). I request you to write a letter to Trivikrama Maharaja and if he can accept this trouble and send them, then after receiving a letter from him I shall send him separate money.\\
I was very enthusiastic to learn in your previous letter that your help will always be available, but having come to learn from your present letter that you are not well, I am discouraged. Whatever happens according to Krsna's desire is for the best. Make me be happy by replying to my letter as soon as you receive mine and give me news of Vrndavana

Yours,\\
Sri Bhaktivedanta Swami
