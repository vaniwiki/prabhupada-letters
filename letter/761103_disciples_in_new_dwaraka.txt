My dear disciples in New Dwaraka,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your telegram regarding the avocado tree.

As far as possible killing the tree should be avoided. If possible the tree should at least be transplanted.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
