My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 11th May, 1970, and noted the contents. Thank you very much for your contribution from yourself and your wife of $8, I have placed it in book fund account.

Regarding your question how to engage yourself, you may travel from University to University and preach as you suggest, or you may go and work. For local work or engagement you consult with Hansadutta and Tamala as they are in charge of the Hamburg management. After all we have to fix up our Hamburg Temple still more.

Regarding your staying back during Rathayatra, I think that is just a nice arrangement because someone must remain with the Temple during the absence of the others. Also since you are having some trouble with the immigration because of draft, and you already got a nice German wife, the best thing will be to make your headquarters there in Germany. So in this way manage things nicely in consultation with Hansadutta, and Krsna will provide you with ample opportunities according to your sincerity to spread His Movement. Just try to make our Krsna Consciousness Movement strong in Germany and you will also automatically become strong in such devotional service or Krsna Consciousness.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. So far your taking German citizenship, as I have hinted above, it is a good idea, so you try for it.\\
