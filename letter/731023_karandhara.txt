My dear Karandhara Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1973 and I have noted the contents with great concern. So you may immediately send Nitai Das here to me in India and he may remain with me to do this work.

I am enclosing a check for $15.00 No. 175639 drawn on Banker's Trust Co. U.S.A. by the Commercial Bank of Australia, Melbourne. Please deposit it in my investment account. Also enclosed is one slip which needs to be given at the Bank of America Culver City Branch, AttN; Marie.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
