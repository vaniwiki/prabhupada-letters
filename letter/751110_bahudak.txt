My dear Bahudak das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 23rd and have noted the contents. I am glad to note that you are taking out the traveling party. I hope that you have good success. Just do everything very soberly. Regarding the instruments, stringed instruments are Vedic, but the real Vedic instrument is mrdanga and karatala. Anyway, you have to do according to the time and circumstances if you use these other instruments. So you have got my approval and you can go on.

Regarding complaints by the sannyasis, these things shall be discussed in everyone's presence at the Mayapur meeting. There is no question of change but sometimes change is invigorating.

I note that your wife has given birth to one girl child. Are all your other children also dasi's or do you have any das's? We want more das's than dasi's.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
