Dear Sir:

In further reference to our past correspondence, I am wondering if you have as yet advanced 100 Rs. to Sri Ram Natha Murtiwala. I have not heard from Sri Ram Natha for some time so I would like to be informed as to what has transpired in this connection. Thanking you in anticipation of your early reply.

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
