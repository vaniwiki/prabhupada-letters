My dear Amogha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 7, 1974 with enclosed copies of the Library orders. I thank you very much for this. It is very good that our books are being appreciated by the learned circles. If our books are distributed more and more in this way, there will be unlimited scope for spreading this movement of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu all over the world. And, personally I become very much encouraged when I get the report of my books being distributed.

Regarding Indonesia program and Gaura Mandala Bhumidas assisting and so far collecting money in Australia for the project, these things should be consulted with the GBC man. Please give me relief from all the managing so I can devote my brain to the literary work. It requires a great deal of concentration.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
