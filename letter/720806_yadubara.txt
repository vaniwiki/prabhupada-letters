====== Yadubara ======

<card class="letter">
Bombay

My dear Yadubara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter from Calcutta dated July 30, 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. That's all right, you can forget the Lalita Prasada Thakura chapter for the time being. Let it be and help Giriraja with the construction work in Bombay immediately. When I return to India in October I shall see what is the situation and we shall consider further. Lalita Prasad Thakura also wants to consult with me so I shall do that. You should submit to me a weekly report as secretary of our Bombay center, as I am always anxious to know how the things are going on there.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
