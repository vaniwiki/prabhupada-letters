My dear Jaya Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 3rd, 1969. The descriptions given by you are very pleasing and nice. Kindly keep up the standard of your temple activities by mutual cooperation, and everything will come out successful and smooth. Krishna is giving you all help, and the more you serve Him, the more help will come automatically. You were in India, so you have seen our Godbrothers have hundreds of temples and Maths, and others also in India; everyone is nicely maintaining, depending on Krishna. Actually they have no fixed income, but as they serve the Lord, the Lord arranges everything. Therefore, our principle should be to serve nicely, and everything will be arranged by the Lord.

Try to make your press department very nice. The magazine is already selling, and if you make further improvements, the sales will also improve. Just like our English __BTG__: from 5,000 copies they have increased to 25,000 copies per month, and they are going to increase the number of pages from 32 to 40 pages. Regarding the IBM typewriter, is this a composing machine or an ordinary typewriter? If you are able to take a composing machine, that will be very nice. So far as your plan for making Hare Krishna day-glow signs, that is very nice.

Regarding your question about Krishna's associates, the principle is that all living entities are expansions of the Original Living Entity, Krishna. But there are different grades of living entities: Visnu Tattva and Jiva Tattva. Visnu Tattva is almost equal to the level of the Personality of Godhead, and Jiva Tattva is minute particles. So when Lord Caitanya appeared, Nityananda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu were Visnu Tattva; whereas Gadadhara Prabhu and Srivas Prabhu were Shakti Tattva. Jiva Tattva is also within the Shakti Tattva. These things are explained in __TLC__ and other of our books. Lord Nityananda is Balarama Himself, not an expansion of Him. Srila Narottama das Thakura has sung that the Lord who appeared as the Son of Nanda Maharaja has now appeared as the son of Sacidevi; and the same Balarama has appeared as Nityananda. This is the statement of Srila Narottama das Thakura. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
