My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated July 29, 1973 and I have noted the contents with great pleasure.

There is no doubt about it, to distribute books is our most important activity. The temple is a place not for eating and sleeping, but as a base from which we send out our soldiers to fight with maya. Fight with maya means to drop thousand and millions of books into the lap of the conditioned souls. Just like during war time the Bombs are raining from the sky like anything. So you are the expert in this field.

I like also your programme of sending out your best men to teach the others. That is the actual process of Krishna Consciousness. To train others continue this programme so that in the future every devotee in our movement will know the art of distributing books. This is approved by me.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
