My dear Sri Arjuna Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 31, 1975, and it is very encouraging that you have tried to understand our philosophy so quickly. As I am travelling all over the world, I see that people are not satisfied. The dissatisfaction of the whole human race is being manifested in different ways. As sometimes the root disease becomes manifest by different symptoms. So far we understand from authoritative sources the dissatisfaction of the human race can be mitigated only by the acceptance of Krishna consciousness. The Bhagavad-gita confirms this: __bhoktaram yajna tapasam/ sarva loka mahesvaram/ suhrdam sarva bhutanam/ jnatva mam samtim rcchati__ [[books:bg:5:29|(Bg. 5.29)]]. Another example can be given that if by taking care of the cage of the bird without taking any care of the bird within the cage, certainly the bird will be restless and unhappy and create disturbances.

We require the help of many, many young men like you to understand this philosophy thoroughly and preach this movement in an organized way all over the world. Fortunately some young men cooperated with me in the USA, therefore I have been able to push on this movement in the western countries. Similarly if some of the young, educated men like you in India join this movement, we can change the present situation of poverty and restlessness all over India.

In the Bhagavad-gita the procedure is described very elaborately for acting in all fields. We have to simply understand it and accept it, then everything will be peaceful and in a happy situation. Krishna appears for this purpose. He leaves behind His instructions so that in the future people could take His help and guidance. But, if you do not accept His instructions, then how can you be happy?

I am here in Vrindaban for some time. If you conveniently come and stay with me along with some of your interested friends, I shall be happy to convince you how this Krishna consciousness movement is so needed all over the world.

I hope this meets you in good health.

More when we meet.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
