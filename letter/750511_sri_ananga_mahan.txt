My dear Sri Ananga Mahan dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter in Bengali dated 16-4-75 and have noted the contents. It is understood that you are arranging for passport for going to the foreign countries and if you will get it, there will be no difficulty to see our temples in the foreign countries. I hope you have at least 7,000 rs. for your ticket along with return ticket. There will be no difficulty to stay in our different temples and when you are ready, you can write to my Honolulu address as follows: 51 Coelho Way, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. I will reach there by the end of this month.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
