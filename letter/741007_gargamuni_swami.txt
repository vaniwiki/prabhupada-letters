====== Gargamuni Swami ======

<card class="letter">
Dear Gargamuni Swami:

Please accept my humble obeisances. Srila Prabhupad has requested me to ask you to kindly bring Mr. Nannungo and his wife Chhavi here to Mayapur to make the Orissa scheme. Prabhupad will talk with him about how much he is prepared to help.

The three month tourist visas of Sruti Kirti, Nitai, and myself expire within three weeks time. Could you please send down the necessary forms that we can fill out along with other requirements such as how many photographs are required for an extention of the tourist visa. We of course would prefer not having for all three of us having to go into Calcutta to the immigration office personally. Can we get an extension of more than three months?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your servant

Brahmananda Swami
