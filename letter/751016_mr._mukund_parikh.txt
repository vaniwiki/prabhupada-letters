My dear Mr. Parikh,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated August 22, 1975, and I have noted the contents carefully. You are knowing so many languages and you can be of great service in this respect, so why don't you join our Bombay centre and help to propagate Krishna Consciousness in Hindi and other languages.

I hope that this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
