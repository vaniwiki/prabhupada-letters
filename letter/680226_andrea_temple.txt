My dear Andrea Temple,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 20, 1968, and it is very encouraging to me. I am so happy to hear that, by Krishna's Grace, people in that place are taking interest in Krishna Consciousness. This Krishna Consciousness is the most urgent need of the whole human society, and we need so many preachers, both boys and girls, to spread this message throughout the world. So it is very much encouraging to me to learn of your activities there in the Bahama Islands.

So far my coming to Bahamas, I am willing to come there and continue the work of my Guru Maharaja of spreading this Sankirtana movement all over the Western countries. Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted that this Hare Krishna Mantra be sung and chanted in every village and town of the globe, and I am simply trying to carry out the order of my Guru Maharaja to give this Divine Message to the people of the Western world.

I am mendicant, and Sannyasi, and the guest of my students here in the Western world. If you wish for me to fly to Bahamas, then you please send me airplane ticket and I shall come at your bidding. Also, two tickets will be required for my attendants, but I think they may go on the youth fare, which is less expensive. I have been told the weather is very warm there, and the sunshine may be very beneficial to my health. Simply I require some quiet place so to continue my translating work on __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ and that's all. We are mendicant, and missionary, and can make our dwelling place anywhere.

Please continue your good work there, and I am awaiting your reply. I have got plans to leave Los Angeles on March 9 for San Francisco; the address there is ISKCON, 518 Frederick Street, San Francisco, 94117. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
