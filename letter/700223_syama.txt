====== Syama ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Syama Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 19 February, 1970, with your embroidery work on my Guru Maharaja's picture.

Women are by nature endowed with many artistic tendencies, and from the Vedic age we find that high grade women and girls were highly qualified in sixty-four arts. Srimati Radharani was fully qualified in those arts, and therefore, by Her super-excellent transcendental qualities, she could charm Krsna who is the charmer of the three worlds. One of the Principle Gopis was Syama dasi, and you are supposed to follow the footsteps of Syama dasi.

I am very much pleased to note that you are feeling happiness in Krsna Consciousness activities along with your good husband. Please remain in that spirit and chant Hare Krsna sixteen rounds regularly, both husband and wife, and develop New Vrindaban. Next summer if you hold Janmastami gorgeously, as I have already suggested to Kirtanananda Maharaja, surely I shall go there.

Please ask Hayagriva Prabhu to finish the Bhagavad-gita __As It Is__ with full explanation and text, and as soon as it is finished I shall send you some new tapes which you shall work husband and wife conjointly and you will be very pleased.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
