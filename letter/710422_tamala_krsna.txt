====== Tamala Krsna ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Tamala,

Please accept my blessings. Replying your letter dated 13rd. Just received late as yesterday evening. I beg to reply as follows:---I agree to purchase Mr. Mohta's house. The condition mentioned by you appears to be little hazardous. I wish that we may get full vacant possession immediately and we pay the full amount all cash down. If they can not give us full vacant possession immediately then let them give us the full possession of the 1st & 2nd floor on monthly rental basis at Rs 1,500.00. Then we immediately vacate our present house and move in from May 1st, 1971. We live there as temporary tenant say up to 31st December 1971 and as soon as they are prepared to give us full possession of the house we pay the full price settled say Rs 650,000.00. This will be clear transaction for both of us. If not please do the needful.

Regarding Festival in Calcutta, I shall attend. Even though I go to Moscow by the 1st May 1971 for a fortnight only, still I shall be able to come back by the 14th of May 1971 and attend your festival in due course. In that case it will be good advertisement for me that I am turning back to Calcutta after preaching in Moscow. How do you like this idea? Then after finishing Calcutta business I shall go to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur) as we have got a land donated for constructing a temple there.

Regarding big marble Deities, if Mr. Podder has agreed to donate a silver throne for the big size Deities then they will be dispatched from here nicely packed.

Regarding Mayapur, I have sent you the Power of Attorney as desired by you as well as the second check for Rs. %%__%% Please finish the purchase transaction without delay & make the Calcutta Festival a grand success better than Berkeley. Gurudasa & his wife have already gone to Delhi & from there they will go to Calcutta. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
