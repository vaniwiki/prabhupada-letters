====== Atreya Rsi ======

<card class="letter">
Tehran

My dear Atreya Rsi das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 18, 1974 with enclosed letter about the restaurant. Why you could not come to India? I had wanted you to come to discuss some matters. Bhagavan dasa also wanted you to come.

Anyway I know the people of Tehran they like hatha yoga very much. I understand Parivrajakacarya Swami is teaching a course combining both hatha and bhakti yoga to attract the people. This is a very good idea. Somehow or other inject the bhakti yoga. That will save them from the degradations of sense gratification.

Regarding the restaurant, what kind of restaurant it will be? The people of Iran are very rich and they can supply money for this purpose.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
