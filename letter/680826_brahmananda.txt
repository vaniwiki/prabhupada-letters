====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 22, 1968, and so far Dwarkin is concerned, I got one copy of the letter, dated 4th April, 1968, in which for two different invoices they submitted total value, Rs. 2554, showing a balance in their favor, Rs. 688.33., out of which if the value of one Dulcetina is deducted---So, $50.00 means Rs. 375 approximately. So they want 87.71, and the amount due to them may be 433.33. So approximately it comes to the same amount, namely, 87.71. Anyway, I haven't got all the papers with me. You have all these papers, so you can see what is the actual position and do the needful.

I hope by this time the San Francisco devotees have already started for London, and I shall be glad to hear if there is any news from them, or about them.

Regarding the cover of the __Bhagavad-gita as it is__: I want to present before a Consulate General this cover when I may be called to visit him, but because you have wanted it back, so I am sending it to you. If you can secure advance order, that is more important business than showing it to a Consulate General. So I am returning it back to you.

Hope you are well, and all is going nicely there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please send some sets of Srimad-Bhagavatam (2nd & 3rd) to Montreal with bill. The former books sent to Janardana is paid to me here. ACB
