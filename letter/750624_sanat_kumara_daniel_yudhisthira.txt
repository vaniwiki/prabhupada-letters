My dear Sanat Kumar, Daniel, and Yudhisthira:

Please accept my blessings. You have been recommended for initiation by Brahmananda Swami and Cyavana Swami, and I am pleased to accept you as my initiated disciples. They have given me a very nice report of your activities and I am glad to know that the government authorities are taking interest in our movement. It is a good sign. So you go on with your preaching and be very careful to follow the rules and regulations, chanting 16 rounds daily and abstaining from eating animal flesh, intoxicants, gambling, and illicit sex.

Your names are Sanat Kumar---Sarva vit dasa; Daniel---Danda dasa; Yudhisthira---Yogisa dasa.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
