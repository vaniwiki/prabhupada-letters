My dear Ramesvara das Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 19, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning the $12,000 given to me by Jagat Guru Maharaja, that has nothing to do with Nairobi debts. It was an individual contribution to the book fund. Contributions and debt clearing are two different things.

On your recommendation, I am accepting the following devotees for brahminical initiation:

Vamanajana das Adhikari,

Dayalanitai das Adhikari,

Gopavrndesa das brahmacari,

Bahulavana das Adhikari,

Brahmakarika dasi,

Jaganmayi dasi,

Rukmavati dasi,

Viharini dasi,

Jalasayi dasi,

Khandita dasi,

Darmada dasi,

Anavijnani dasi,

Srila dasi,\\
Hold a fire sacrifice and for the male initiates you can give them sacred thread. The gayatri mantra should be played for them into the right ear and the brahmanas should practice the principles of cleanliness both outside and internally. Outside by bathing regularly, and inside by always chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra.

You mentioned that the lawyer was working to open the national parks, etc. What about the L.A. airport situation?

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
