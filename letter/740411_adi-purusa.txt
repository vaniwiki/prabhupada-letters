====== Ādi-purusa ======

<card class="letter">
Gorakhpur

Dear Adipurusa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of you letter dated April 6, 1974.

Regarding the books in question, yes, as you suggest, you may send them to me. They may be dispatched to me here at Hare Krsna Land, Bombay.

I will direct our management of Life membership here to send you publications due you as life member.

I hope you are reading what books of mine you have and chanting Hare Krishna Mantra; these things are our real business in the human form of life, so that we can quit all material suffering and go back to our original home, back to Godhead.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
