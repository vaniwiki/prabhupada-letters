Dear Mr. Lapidus:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 21, 1975. Actually we are not fond of having businesses. Although for spreading Krsna consciousness we can use millions of dollars, yet we do not like to employ many of our men at great endeavor in the competitive business world. In order to manufacture and market your own inventions it would be a great struggle and too much time and energy would have to be spent, as you have stated. It also requires great business expertise to succeed and not be cheated.

You should regard your main business as trying to become Krsna conscious through reading my books and associating with the devotees in the Sankirtana movement there in Brooklyn temple. You are an older man, 68 years old, so I appreciate it if you can help my disciples in New York in cooperation with the President, Gopijanavallabha.

At any rate we do not know how long we shall live. So we have to concentrate on reading, chanting, and distributing books, and in this way try to become Krsna conscious completely before the next death.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
