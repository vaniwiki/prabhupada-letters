====== Upendra ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 6, 1969 and your letters of January 10th and 11th, 1969. From your recent letters I can understand that you are keeping yourself busily engaged and are improving nicely. This is our process, that you do not let even one minute go by without doing some sort of service for Krishna. Because as soon as there is a little gap of Krishna Consciousness, immediately maya makes an attack to grab us again. So keep up with your kirtanas and outside engagements and always think of Krishna so that maya will not have a second's opportunity to try to conquer you. And Krishna gives all assurance that the sincere devotee will never know defeat, so if you simply try to propagate our movement in the Seattle area, you will be successful, rest assured.

Regarding this boy, Charles McCollough, if he is able, I think he may come to see me at Los Angeles so I may discuss with him initiation. So you may inform him in this way.

So far as your question about evolution, you should know that the aspects of this theory which are actually correct offer no contradiction to the Vedic version. This whole topic has been very nicely explained in an article in Back To Godhead, "Evolution, the God That's Failing". So I refer you to this article which was in a few issues back. This should clear up your questions.

Please offer my blessings to all others there. I hope this finds all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
