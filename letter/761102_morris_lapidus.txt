My dear Morris Lapidus,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated October 22, 1976.

I am sorry to see that you have so many quarrels with my disciples. They are working very hard on my behalf trying to serve Krsna. Why not try to cooperate with them, instead of trying to get them to cooperate with you. I understand you are older, but then please just try to be tolerant and help in whatever way you can. Krsna will see your sincere desire, and if He wants you will be recognized and if not, there is nothing you can do to force it.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
