====== Acyutananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Acyutananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note along with Jaya Govinda's. The Bengali which you've written are simply nonsense. They are full of mistakes. And each and every word is misspelled. Just like you have written, "Bhutale" as "Bhuthale." It is not very much encouraging. Neither it is good that you do something wrong and at the end you simply write please forgive us. The best thing will be that both of may go to Bombay and begin a positive work under my direction. Don't be carried away by whims, and waste time and money. As there is no possibility of printing in Delhi, you kindly pack up the manuscript and send it to New York.

Hope you are well,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
