====== Batu Gopala ======

<card class="letter">
Cleveland

My dear Batu Gopala Das: I have received your letter dated 3/8/74.

Please accept my blessings. It is all right that you have remained there to do your duty. One should not leave a place if there is important business to do. That should be the principle. Here the temple opening has been postponed until the temple and asrama are fully completed. Yes, send the photos of your Deities, and I shall offer my obeisances.

Regarding the art of management, constant changing is not good. Even if there is some fault in management it should be corrected, not changed. Besides that, Vaisnava philosophy is that everyone is addressed as prabhu, or master. Everyone should consider himself the servant of the other. That will make management very nice.

Yes, you remain there in Cleveland permanently and manage it very nicely. That will please me.

Regarding the restaurant, you should not name it as you have suggested, but "Hare Krishna Restaurant." That should be the name. In each restaurant there should be the picture of Lord Caitanya, and the foods should be offered and distributed to the respected customers. There should also be a tape recorder playing the Sankirtana in mild voice.

Regarding the secretary for the Central Zone, I have now re-appointed Jagadisa Prabhu who has returned from India.

Regarding the devotees whom you have recommended, I accept them upon your recommendation and their initiated names are as follows:

John Haslett---Halayudha

Marjorie Haslett---Manovega devi

Chris Hayes---Khangi\\
Please see to it that they follow the regulative principles strictly. That is your responsibility.

You may send the photos of your Deities here to Vrindaban.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
