My dear Janis,

I am so glad to receive your kind letter, dated November 30, 1966, with enclosure of $50.00 on account for my books. Thank you very much. Just on receipt of your letter, I have already sent you, through the Railway Express Company, the following books and literatures:\\
18 sets Srimad-Bhagavatam\\
25 copies Krishna the Reservoir of Pleasure---25 cents\\
25 copies Who Is Crazy?---25 cents\\
40 copies Introduction to Gitopanisad---35 cents\\
40 copies Back to Godhead (#1)---15 cents\\
35 copies Back to Godhead (#2)---15 cents\\
35 copies Back to Godhead (#3)---15 cents

I am so glad to hear that you are now married. I pray Krishna that you may live henceforward happily as a householder, without thinking of a separation from your wife. According to Vedic wisdom, a good wife is a great assistant for material and spiritual prosperity. Even if there is some deficiency, you should try to correct it without thinking in the Westernized way. I hope your wife may be taking interest in your chanting Sankirtana and reading Srimad-Bhagavatam. As she has become your life's companion, it is your duty to induce her, peacefully, in the matter of spiritual advancement of life.

Material bodily conditions may be taken as secondary. Your primary occupation should be Krishna Consciousness. I am sorry to learn that you have lost some money, to the extent of $350, and that you are involved in some court case. In the future, as far as possible, try to avoid such entanglements. Of course, Krishna will save you if you are forced to be so entangled.

Now you can distribute the books and the paper, Back to Godhead, to the best of your capacity, and if you require more, we shall be glad to send them.

When you send the remittance, please also send separate accounts for the books and the other literatures.

I think I shall be engaged in California during January and February. So, April and May will be quite suitable for me to go to Montreal. To go at both times will not be possible. If, however, I do not go to California, then I shall write to you.

I thank your father for his remembering me, and if I meet him sometime, I shall not disclose your wedding, rest assured.

Please send me your news at least twice in a month.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
