====== Gargamuni ======

<card class="letter">
Vrindaban

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter from Vrindaban dated July 29, 1972, and I am not very much pleased to note that you are leaving our ISKCON Society forever. I have not received report from Dinanath or anyone else in this matter, so I do not know what is the real position, but such kinds of disturbances are not at all desirable. So you can come here and live with me immediately. You have nothing to do, simply chant and take prasadam. Do not be disturbed by the other devotees. Or, I am coming to India very soon, at least by October, so you please wait for me either in Bombay or Vrindaban or Mayapur, until I come back. Or if you cannot wait, you can come and live with me.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
