====== Mr. Nakano ======

<card class="letter">
Dear Mr. Nakano,

In continuation of my Reg. letter of the 18th instant I beg to inform you that on 20/4/61 I have received the reply from the government which reads as follows.\\
I have therefore sent you today the following cable which I beg to confirm herewith.

As you have developed a deep love for me, I dare to ask you to send me financial help to take me to Japan. I think you can immediately instruct your Embassy in Delhi to do the needful and dispatch me to Japan on your behalf. I am feeling too much to meet you and the Congress so that we can build up a solid institute for spiritual cultivation.

I shall await your instruction by cable to fix up my programs.
