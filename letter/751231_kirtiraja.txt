====== Kirtiraja ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Kirtiraja Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 7, 1975. I am very please to note your activities in Warsaw Poland. Yes if you can arrange for the translation of my books in Polish language that will please me very much. We do not have to manufacture anything new. We are getting perfect knowledge from krishna through the disciplic succession, so our position is very firm. Whatever we hear from the bona fide spiritual master should be practiced in life and the same message delivered to whomever we meet. In this way you become spiritual master.

We have got so many big big books now, so any sane man will appreciate them, you simply have to present them, that's all. Is it very difficult? It is being done all over the world and professors and scholars are appreciating them by writing reviews and introducing them as standard text books in their university courses. So try to present my books there. It is assure of success because Lord Caitanya predicted, "In ever town and village of the world, my name will be known" The whole world is full of rascals presenting concocted ideas and everyone is suffering. Caitanya Mahaprabhu came just to deliver these rascals. How?

hare nama hare nama hare nama eva kevalam\\
kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha

Chant Hare Krishna, induce others to chant, and distribute prasadam. This can be done everywhere, who will object. Temple or no temple, you simply chant and give prasadam and it will act.

I am very please that you have taken so much courage and I pray that Krishna will bless you with more and more success. Please keep me informed of your activities and send copy to Hansadutta and Cakravarti in Germany so that they may help you as far as possible.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
