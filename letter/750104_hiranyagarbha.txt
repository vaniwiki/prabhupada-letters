====== Hiranyagarbha ======

<card class="letter">
New Vrindaban

My dear Hiranyagarbha dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 25th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Those young boys are living as true brahmacaris. Brahmacari's business is to study and then go to make some collection on behalf of the guru. This is very good engagement for them.

No one can understand Krishna as He is by the blunt material senses but He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him. So, keep everyone engaged 24 hours and everything will be all right.

Bring them all to India for Lord Caitanya's appearance day and they can also attend the opening of the Krishna-Balarama Temple in Vrndavana.

I have accept Tausteya (Joseph Fournier) as my duly initiated disciple and his name is Jagamanalobha dasa. Kirtanananda Svami can chant his beads.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
