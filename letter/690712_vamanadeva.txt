====== Vamanadeva ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 2, 1969, and I am very glad that you are now in the Columbus center and you are working nicely to help the devotees there. You also write to say that you have a good job that will further train you in carpentry skills, so do this nicely. It is a good opportunity. If you want to marry, you may inform all the centers that you are looking for a wife, and if a girl is willing to marry, there is no objection. It is a nice idea. But if you marry, you will have to work to provide for your family, and try to spend at least 50% for Krishna. Regarding your Gayatri Mantra, most probably I will go to New York for a short time at the end of this month before going to Germany, and I shall let you know the exact day so you may arrange to meet me while I am there. Be very strong in Krishna Consciousness always, and I am sure that Krishna will bestow all of His Blessings upon you.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
