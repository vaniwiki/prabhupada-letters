====== Jadurani ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I was so much happy to receive your letter Nov. 21, 1967, on my arrival. I hope in the meantime you have received my letter from Calcutta. I also hope you might have received some pictures which were sent from Calcutta. If you can, send one offset copy of the horses and chariot of Arjuna. Govinda dasi may draw a small picture of the same chariot for printing on the front page of Back to Godhead.

When I left your country on the 22nd of July, I had very little hope to come back again. But Krishna informed me that I'm not going to die immediately; therefore, I have come back again to get inspiration of Krishna Consciousness from you all good souls. Although officially I am your Spiritual Master, I consider you all students as my Spiritual Master because your love for Krishna and service for Krishna teach me how to become a sincere Krishna Conscious person.

Yes, as I told you before, you can send all the different varieties of pictures to every center, especially the Sankirtana picture and Radha-Krishna picture. As you asked, the Panca-tattva paintings also.

I understand that there are only three persons at Boston, but each of you can work for 300 persons, so it is not the numerical strength that works, but it is Krishna Consciousness that works. A Krishna Conscious person is never tired of working and the symptoms I can see in you as you want to be overloaded with work. This is the test of how one is advancing in Krishna Consciousness. Nobody becomes tired but wants to work more and more. Your God-brother Satsvarupa also told me the same thing that he may be overloaded with typewriting work. Similarly, Govinda dasi and Gaurasundara also want to be overloaded with work. So your examples are great encouragement for an old man like me. I have got the same spirit of being overloaded with Krishna Conscious work, but physically I am not as strong as you are all young boys and girls. You can pray to Krishna that I may get your strength to serve the cause of Krishna Consciousness.

Please convey my blessings to Satsvarupa and Pradyumna. Inform Satsvarupa that very soon I'm going to overload him with tapes for typing. My dictaphone is a little out of order (Gargamuni has taken charge of repairing it) and as soon as I get it back my work on __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ will begin. At the present moment, I have got some difficulty in sleeping. I cannot sleep more than 3 hours at night, and 1 hour in day. So if it continues like that, and if I keep fit, I think I shall have ample time to work writing books.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
