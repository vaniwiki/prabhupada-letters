My dear Jagatikanda devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 12, 1974 with enclosed silken bead bag. I thank you very much for it. I am now using it for my chanting beads, so it is a welcome gift.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
