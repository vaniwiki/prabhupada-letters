Dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from you in some time and I am eager to hear a report on construction of Krishna Balarama Temple. Have you obtained the marbles slabs, are they being set in? Please let me know how things are going on by sending a report to me in Bombay. Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
