Trinidad

My dear Vaikunthanatha,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife Saradia. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22nd August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far going to the moon planet is concerned, don't be very much interested in moon travel. Better that you travel on this planet and serve Krishna. We don't care for such moon travel. Rather after this life we want to travel to Krishna. If even we go to Brahmaloka, the topmost planet, still we have to come down. So let the foolish waste their time in this way, while we will go directly to Krishna.

I am sending herewith, please find, complete plans for a temple there in Trinidad, drawn by Rancor Prabhu here in London. So as soon as you receive the deed you should give these plans to the government, get them sanctioned and begin construction. In the design you will find a portion especially meant for my residence. So it will be a great pleasure for me to go there and live with you for some time. Since 1965 or before that there was a plan for me to go to Trinidad. I had some correspondence with one Mr. Kuldap. I do not know if you have met this gentleman. He was very anxious to get me there. At that time it was not possible for me to go there. Now, by Krishna's grace, if you arrange for my going there it will be very nice.

Hoping this will meet both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
