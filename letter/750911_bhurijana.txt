My dear Bhurijana das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated August 22, 29th and September 5th with enclosed Dollars 50.00, 159.61, and 126.50. You say that someday you hope to be useful, but you are already useful---you are sending checks. This is the best useful. You are remembering me and chanting Hare Krishna. This is Krishna consciousness.

Regarding the other matters, a difference between godbrothers is natural. That difference of opinion will continue, what can be done. Siddhasvarupananda Maharaja and his group, whenever they see me they give me money. So they are not against me. So it is a natural thing for the brothers to fight, as long as they all stay obedient to the father.

You do whatever you like, but do not forget chanting and following the rules and regulations. That will save you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
