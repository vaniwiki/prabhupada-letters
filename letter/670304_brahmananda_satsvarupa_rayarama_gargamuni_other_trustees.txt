My dear boys,

Please immediately hold one meeting of the Trustees of International Society For Krishna Consciousness Inc and resolve whether $5000.00 dollars should immediately be paid to the seller of the house under agreement and as advised by the appointed Lawyer Mr. Seymour Herzog.

In my opinion the check should never be drawn in favor of the financier. But it should be drawn in the name of original seller Mr. Taylor. If the Financier pays to Mr. Taylor the purchase money it is then only the above $5000.00 should be money paid on behalf of the Financier and the Financier should enter into agreement with you acknowledging receipt of the amount with definite date or immediate possession of the house. In all circumstances the check may not be drawn in favor of the financier. The check should be signed by the President and the Secretary because Brahmananda and Satsvarupa are the main support for purchasing the house and Kirtanananda is supplement to this from his kitchen department. The money and society is yours. You can spend in any way but it is my duty to give you guidance as ever well wisher. You should send me a copy of the resolution you will make in this connection in the meeting of the Trustees. Please note that I have already advised the Bank to transfer $5000.00 in the account of the Society and have sent them the Pass Book as desired by Brahmananda. Pray to Krishna for your successful transaction and I hope when I go to New York next I shall enter the new house forthwith. Please send me a copy of the agreement entered. With my blessings, I am yours

Ever well wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
