My dear Satsvarupa das Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge of your letter dated from Denver September 7, 1974 with enclosed outline of the book "A Vedic Reader: Sources of Indian Civilization" The synopsis is very nice, and if properly written the book will be very nice. From this book they will understand the importance of our society. So do it nicely.

It is all right that you present only the verses with a short description and that you can also write parts of the essays in the first part of the book, as you have suggested.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
