My dear Tamala Krsna Goswami,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed find a copy of a letter I have just received from Hari Charan Goswami. As he states therein, he is willing to teach our students Hindi and Sanskrit. We want to introduce this program of teaching our students Hindi and Sanskrit for two reasons. First of all, as I have already explained in a previous letter, if we can establish a bona fide language school then our American and European disciples can acquire student visas for coming to India. This will solve our visa problem. Secondly, if our students can actually preach in Hindi, periodically quoting Sanskrit, it will be a very good credit for us and very respectfully received by the Indian people. I have asked Dr. Kapoor in Vrindaban and also one pandita named Nrsimha Vallabha to also teach our students Hindi and Sanskrit. The curriculum can be two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening and the panditas can be paid Rs. 200 per month. Our students, however, must be prepared to apply themselves and actually learn the languages. Mr. B. R. Mohatta, our life member from Bombay, has just today visited me in Los Angeles and we have discussed this matter of the language school. He has advised that we take sanction for our school from different branches of the Indian Government such as the educational department, the social welfare department, and the cultural department. He says that we must approach them on the platform of wanting to present and develop this school for its educational and cultural value but not to place any stress on any religious import. Otherwise we shall not get any support from the government. He has described to me how the Rama-Krsna Mission is getting so much support from the government only on the pretext that they are keeping schools and medical clinics. Factually their schools and clinics are for namesake only and they are using the government's support to mainly propagate their philosophy. So in this way we also must take government support by tactfully presenting a solid and organized proposal. I want very much that this project should be initiated immediately and followed through with all necessary attention and endeavor. Now I have given some hint and I am turning the matter over to you for execution.

I am standing by to hear from you whether or not we have obtained municipal sanction for our plans for our Juhu Beach scheme.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
