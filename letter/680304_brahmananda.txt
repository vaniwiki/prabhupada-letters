====== Brahmananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your note regarding United Shipping Corporation; so you can unload the books, 15 cases, paying $242.00 from my book fund, and after clearing the books, we shall see what is the cost of transporting. I see that United Shipping Corp. has explained in their letter, dated Feb. 22, a copy of which you have sent me, that they have not been able to pay the ocean fare for this consignment, and the money is with them, and they submit account for that. So, after clearing the books, we will see to the account. In the meantime, if possible you can see the American Export Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc., whose office is situated at 26 Broadway, New York, N.Y., 10004. I think you can see the manager of this carrying company and try to get some concessional rates for things we import from India. Here in San Francisco, there is one carrying company, American Mail Lines, and they have agreed to give us 10% concession on the freight. When I go to S.F., I shall see that they may grant some more concession. You have to convince the carrying company that our this world wide Krishna Consciousness movement, so everything required is for the help of this society. Government gives us all facility of exemptions from the tax, and as we have got to import so many articles from India, and maybe we may export also so many things from America to India for maintaining the status of the institution, they may give us some concessional rates. You may mention that Scindia Steam Navigation Co. of Bombay was giving us concession all free, but recently, might be due to their internal dissension, they have stopped this concession. So we can claim some concessional rate from everyone because our society is for public welfare activities. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am going to S.F. on the 8th morning. If possible send some Japamalas with bags and a Mrdanga there. The Japamala with bag should be charged at $5/per piece. And Mrdanga $50.00. Tambura $100.00 Harmonium $200.00 and all money along with book sets at $16.00 shall be collected for my Book Fund. I require $40,000.00 for my Bhagavatam.
