Dear Behari das:

Please accept my best wishes. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12/10/74 and have noted the contents. I could have recommended something for you, but you could not reply me a proper account, what was collected and what was spent. Several times you gave me different figures, so how can I recommend you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Faithfully yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
