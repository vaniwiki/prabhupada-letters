====== Sridama ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Sridama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 29, 1969 from Philadelphia along with your check for $642, and I thank you very much for your kind contribution. I am surprised to know that the actual collection was $1,750 and the doctors and lawyers, etc. have taken more than $1,000. Anyway, something is better than nothing. Whatever we have got will be used for Krishna's service. Yes, I always remember you for your kind personal attention upon me, and most probably, if you are not engaged otherwise, I shall call you when I return back to the States.

I hope this will find you in good health. Please keep yourself always chanting regularly. That is our only strength within this whirlpool of the ocean of nescience.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
