My dear Yasomatisuta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 19, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to hear of your translating work there. This is very encouraging. Please continue it with full enthusiasm. I was told by Brahmananda Svami that you have finished 3 chapters of Gita already. So, I have asked that it be immediately printed and then as soon as you translate 3 chapters of Gita already. So, I have asked that it be immediately printed and then as soon as you translate 3 chapters more it can be printed. In this way the whole book will be done in six volumes.

Regarding your question, you can always use some equivalent to the words __Supreme Personality of Godhead.__ That will save the situation. The real thing is that you are trying to serve Krishna, He will give you all intelligence.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
