My dear Mahamsa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 26, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning the installation ceremonies, it is approved that you get some leading Ramanuja Pandits from S. India. The Vrindaban Pandits were useless. But one thing. Along with the panditas, our men should also join in.

Concerning the Nellore project, it will automatically be dropped. Simply forget it, and there is no need to go there. Let them rather drop it instead of we dropping it. Let them say, you are not doing anything so we drop it.

Your plan to have travelling parties go out village to village preaching and distributing my books in Telugu language is very important. Do it nicely.

Regarding the trustees for the land, first of all get the land transferred to the ISKCON Trust, then I can send you the names of the 6 trustees from our side. I am having the GBC discuss the matter of trustees in New York and at that time the matter can be taken up in detail. I am presently in Detroit and after that I shall be going to Toronto, New Vrindaban, Washington, D.C., and reaching New York by July 9th.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
