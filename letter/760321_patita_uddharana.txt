====== Patita Uddharana ======

<card class="letter">
Indre, France

My dear Patita Uddharana das,

Please accept my blessings. I received one letter from Shaktimata Devi Dasi whom you know from London. She is presently in Nairobi and is looking for a good husband for her daughter. She wrote one letter appealing that you might consider marrying her daughter. So, if you are agreeable then I have not objection.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. her address in Nairobi is: Srimati Shaktimati, P.O. Box 41770, Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa.\\
