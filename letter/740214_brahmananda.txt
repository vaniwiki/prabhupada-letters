Dear Brahmananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 24, 1974, which has only reached me now due to travelling.

I appreciate your spirit in wanting to retaliate against the Kenya government for their not allowing me to enter the country on Krsna's mission. I think, however, that the proposal of international demonstrations at the embassies of the Kenya government would be a waste of time. If it could not be done from there why waste our time in such demonstrations.

Rather let us answer this atrocity by converting all Africans to Krsna Consciousness. Please keep in the front of your attention my desire that you convert the Africans. I know you have some of them already now train them up, so that even if you are forced to leave, they will be able to carry on Krsna Consciousness on their own. That is your real work rather than promoting international demonstrations abroad. Better you work the poison at home, and make the Africans Krsna Conscious, then my mission will be served.

I will be glad to see you when we all meet at Mayapur.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
