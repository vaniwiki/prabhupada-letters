====== Nityananda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Nityananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 3, 1972, and I am very glad to hear from you that you have got a nice new temple there, which is also large, and that in general everything at New Orleans Center is progressing well under your supervision. I am very much satisfied. I am also pleased to hear something about Kirtanananda's party, and if you have them, kindly send me one photo of these painted busses, how they look, so I may be inspired by seeing them.

The newsletter is also very nice, and you may encourage all centers to correspond in this way regularly amongst yourselves. When I shall come there to Los Angeles, then we shall see when I can also come to stay at your new temple.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
