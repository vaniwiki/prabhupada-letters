====== Himavati ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of December 6, 1968 and I thank you very much for it. Just as you are thinking of me so often, similarly, you should know that I am often thinking of you also. So if you can remember to always remember Krishna and the instructions of your Spiritual Master than surely this will bring the highest benediction to yourself and to those with whom you come into contact. To the extent we are thinking of Krishna, to that extent Maya has no influence. But as much as we are desiring to forget Krishna and trying to enjoy for ourself, so to that extent we must suffer the pains of Maya. So our remedy for material life is very simple, simply to chant for Krishna, to dance for Krishna, to work, prepare nice foods for Krishna and then cent per cent we become fully free from all other influences. Please always remember this secret and show by example to all others.

Please convey my thanks to Satyabhama for her nice work in sewing the clothes for my deities. These deities will require several more sets of such excellent dresses so Satyabhama or youself may supply as you are able.

Your sewing proposal is very nice and such idea is given by the Grace of Krishna. Try to utilize your profits to maintain the temple with your husband and the others. With much pleasure I have seen the French edition of Back To Godhead and I thank you all for this endeavor. With such engagements as this magazine, we can live to propagate Krishna Consciousness and that is the success of our lives. Actually, our living conditions can be minimized as far as possible. Simply we should live for propagating Krishna Consciousness. That is our life.

In conclusion to your letter you have asked as to where is the ocean of love? And I think that you may know that it is in your heart.

So please convey my blessings to all others there and I hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
