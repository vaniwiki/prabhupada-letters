My dear Gurukrpa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I have received your request through Bhagavan das to initiate the following as twice initiated brahmanas. Upon your recommendation I accept them. Enclosed are the sanctified threads and the mantra sheet for Vamsivadana Suvasa das and Nischintya das.

You can hold a fire sacrifice and they can hear the mantra from my tape recording through the right ear. They must chant the mantra three times daily.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
