My dear Bankatesh das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and have noted the contents. I suggest that you confer with Hansadutta prabhu who is in Germany. Perhaps you can go to another temple either in Germany or in Paris. Hansadutta can check with Prthu prabhu to take care of this matter. Paris is the nearest temple to you so if you like you can go there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
