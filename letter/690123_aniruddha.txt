====== Aniruddha ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 22, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I can understand from your letter that there has been some disagreements or misunderstandings in the temple, but I think that you should know that all such disturbances must be solved peacefully and with consideration of the entire situation. Cidananda is the president there, and I think you understand rightly that everyone must cooperate with him in keeping the temple nicely and without any unnecessary tensions.

Any way, if you are feeling too much inconvenience staying in San Francisco, then you are welcome to come to Los Angeles and stay here with me. But if you can help to smooth over the difficulties there that will be the best thing. You are a sincere and intelligent boy, so if you along with all of the members combine to cooperate with one another in our mission of spreading Krishna Consciousness that will be very nice. I am pleased to note that Girish is progressing nicely under your guidance. Our plan for a school is progressing very well, and already we have many qualified teachers amongst our disciples who are looking forward to beginning this activity there. Next month, Paramananda and his wife, Satyabhama, who is a qualified teacher, will be going to New Vrindaban to stay, and similarly there are many others who will be going there in the near future to start work on this new venture. So the future of our movement will be very bright, and similarly your future will be very bright also, so there is no need for you to be depressed about any previous misunderstandings. Simply you have to remember to chant Hare Krishna always, tell others to do the same, help in all respects to spread the glories of Krishna Consciousness, and certainly Krishna will help you in your efforts to solve any of the difficulties that may be taking place. But if you think that staying with me in Los Angeles will be better for you then you may consider this.

Thanking you once more for your letter. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
