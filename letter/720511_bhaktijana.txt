My dear Bhaktijana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 8, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. I very much approve of your plan for spreading Krishna Consciousness in the black African neighborhoods in New York and other places. If there are some boys there who can take charge and do things nicely, you can assist them organizing this programme.

One thing is, we have got very good response in Africa by our kirtana, so have sankirtana widely, with dancing, and that will attract everyone, and also distribute many of our Krishna Books, paperback edition---they were especially meant for the Africans. Kindly keep me informed what is your progress in this connection, I shall be always glad to hear from you. Thank you very much for assisting me in this way.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
