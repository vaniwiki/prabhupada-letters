My dear Mangalananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January, 9th, 1976, and I have noted the contents. Your proposal for a varnasrama college shall be discussed at the GBC meeting at Mayapur, this coming March.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
