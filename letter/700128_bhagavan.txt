====== Bhagavan ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24 January, 1970 with enclosure of the edited copy of transcription from tape #6.

Your editing is very good, I liked it very much. So shall I send you tapes or you may like to have copies transcribed first?

Whatever is suitable for you I shall do, but today I am sending another tape herewith. The edited copies should be four, out of which one may be sent to Boston, one to me and two may be kept by you for future reference. The original transcription copy also may be sent to Satsvarupa.

I am so glad that you are giving attention to selling our books, and you have got a good assistant also. You will be pleased to know that George Harrison has paid the entire expenditure ($19,000) for printing our __Krishna__ picture book, and very soon I am going to send the MS to Japan. Our own press is now busy with other books.

Regarding your question: Santa Rasa devotee has got unflinching faith in Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he has not developed the tendency to serve Him. The service stage is in relation with Bhagavan, the Person. When service attitude is lacking, it is to be understood as worship of Paramatma or Brahman.

In Paramatma or Brahman relationship the emotion is of oneness, which is considered to be on the lower stage. In the Santa Rasa stage there is a chance of meeting a devotee by the Grace of Lord Krishna, and therefore, generally, the next birth is human being. Unless there is a great fall-down on account of various reasons, any transcendentalist, either personalist or impersonalist, if he makes regular progress in the regulative principles, even though he does not finish, the whole program, is sure to get his next birth in a good family---generally a rich man's or a pure Brahmin's---that is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
