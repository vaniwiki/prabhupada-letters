====== Vaikunthanatha, Saradia ======

Trinidad

My dear Vaikunthanatha and Saradia,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Previously I had written you one letter on 24th July, and I hope that you have received it by now. Just now I have come to London after spending two weeks in N.Y. Both these centers are doing very nicely. Also, when I was in Los Angeles, Krishna das came to see me from San Francisco. He was having some doubts but now he is all right and has again begun making plans for going to Moscow. He is very enthusiastic about it.

So far Nara Narayana is concerned, presently he is applying for missionary visa so that he can go to Mayapur and help with the construction work there. So he won't be able to go to Trinidad. But you write to say that you are trying to get the use of one of many old temples there for an ISKCON center. That will be very nice, so try for it. BTG and book distribution is going on so nicely there. Especially continue this program enthusiastically. It is so much encouraging. I am so much grateful to you both, husband and wife, that you are so much helping me to fulfill the order of my Guru Maharaja and surely Krishna will give you all facility for making our Trinidad center a grand success and surely He will bless you more and more. Just as soon as you have secured a nice temple and have organized a nice program, I will be glad to come and visit there. That will be very nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
