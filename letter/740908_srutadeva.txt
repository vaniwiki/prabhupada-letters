Washington, D.C.

My dear Srutadeva das;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 15th, along with the sankirtana news letter #19, and I thank you very much for it. You can continue sending me these news letters as you publish them weekly. It is this sankirtana which is the life and soul of our movement. Sankirtana and book distribution should go on together side by side. I am always glad when these activities are increasing and my pleasure is always increasing.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
