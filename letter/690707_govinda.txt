====== Govinda ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Govinda Dasi,

Please accept my blessings, and offer the same to Gaurasundara. I am so much pleased by reading your letter of June 26, 1969, describing your preaching activities in Hawaii, both husband and wife together. It is very much pleasing to me. I was shocked when I heard that Gaurasundara was hurt on the chin, but at the same time, I was so much enlivened by hearing of your spirited preaching activities. I am proud that a little young girl like you is so much spirited in preaching Krishna consciousness. Undoubtedly I was very much sorry to learn about Gaurasundara being attacked by a fanatic, but don't be disheartened. Even Nityananda also faced such difficult problems, but try to avoid them as far as possible. The whole world is full of fanatics and atheist classes of men, so sometimes we have to face such difficulties. But this is all tapasya. Without tapasya, nobody can approach Krishna. So preachers who boldly face all kinds of difficulties are considered to be under tapasya, and Krishna takes note of such tapasya of the devotee, and the devotee is recognized by Him. I have asked the __BTG__ men to publish your heroic preaching activities under the heading of "Heroine Govinda Dasi." So I am sure Krishna is very much pleased of this incident, and He will surely bestow His blessings both on you and Gaurasundara. So try to continue preaching Krishna Consciousness to the suffering humanity as far as possible.

I hope by this time your house problem is solved, and I shall be glad to hear from you on this point. I have received one letter from Subala das from Philadelphia informing me that he has opened a center there. So by Krishna's Grace our program is improving day after day. Most probably another center in Laguna Beach will be opened soon, and they are arranging for a gorgeous Rathayatra Ceremony in San Francisco. So you have all my blessings and encouragement for your nice preaching work, and I can simply pray to Krishna to save you from all sorts of difficulties.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
