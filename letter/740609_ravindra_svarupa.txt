====== Ravindra Svarupa ======

<card class="letter">
Philadelphia

My dear Ravindra Svarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of May 14, received in Paris.

I have accepted on your recommendation the three devotees as my duly initiated disciples, and their spiritual names are as follows:

Patti---Pattarajni devi

Donna---Dantadhara devi

Lois---Atura devi

I have also accepted your recommendation for Vanamali prabhu to take second initiation. Enclosed is one sacred thread and gayatri mantra. Have him hear the tape of my chanting the mantra, in his right ear. The beads of the initiated devotees may be chanted on by Kirtanananda Maharaja.

I am glad to hear you are holding a larger Ratha yatra this year. Your multifarious activities in Krsna Consciousness in Philadelphia sound very good. We have so many engagements, therefore I have asked that the political program be stopped as it was creating too much separate effort separate brain, separate money from our regular ISKCON program. I shall be coming to the U.S. in July and perhaps you can see me in Chicago or later in New Vrindaban.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
