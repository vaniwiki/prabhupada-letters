====== Bhagavata ======

<card class="letter">
Calcutta

My dear Bhagavata das:

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find a copy of a letter addressed to the Central Bank of India, Camac Street Branch dated June 2, 1975. I have not received any reply from them. Will you please personally go to the bank and take their reply or any other information regarding the subject matter and let me know definitely at the above address in Berkeley.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Round about our temple there are many apartment houses constructed. Will you enquire about an apartment not less than three rooms and up to four rooms and find out what is the price and what are the terms.\\
