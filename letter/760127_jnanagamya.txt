====== Jnanagamya ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Jnanagamya,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated December 26th, 1975.

Regarding making a movie to help people become Krishna Conscious. If we show such devotional activities as worshiping the Deity, the karmis will think it is some sentiment, people worshiping a statue. Unless they hear from devotees and then practically perform devotional service themselves, what benefit will there be? As far as your point that those who say movies about Hitler identified with him and followed him, Hitler was still finished despite so much propaganda. Napoleon, Mussolini, Churchill---they all made so much propaganda---but the French, Italian, British, and German empires are all lost now. Our real propaganda is to chant the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra, and let the mass of people chant and dance with us. If this movie induces people to chant and dance it is O.K. If it aids our cause then it is welcome. The best thing is for you to give this subject matter to your GBC for discussion at this year's GBC meeting in March.

The photos you have sent are very nice. Thank you. I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
