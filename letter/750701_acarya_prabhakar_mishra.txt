My dear Prabhakar:

Please accept my blessings. I wrote you one letter on May 31, 1975, but I have not received any reply from you. Did you see Nandaji in this connection?

Please reply this letter at the following address immediately: ISKCON, 2334 Stuart St., Berkeley, California 94075, U.S.A.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
