====== Bali-mardana ======

<card class="letter">
My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you so much for your letter, sent along with a check for $160. I am pleased to learn that you have now finished your college studies, and now you are going to engage yourself fully in promoting our Krishna Consciousness books. Your idea of not working for your father is nice, and several times I have stressed that our devotees are becoming twice-born. They are dvija, or twice-born. The first birth is by the natural father and mother, and the second birth is by the Spiritual Father and the Vedic knowledge. The second birth is the real birth; the first is as good as an animal's birth. It is said by a devotee of Lord Caitanya that in every birth we have got a certain type of father and mother, that is not very wonderful, but it is not possible in every birth to get Krishna and a Spiritual Master. Therefore, the form of life in which Krishna and the Spiritual Master is obtained is the most sublime. So I am very glad to know that you have become more affectionate for your Spiritual Father than for your natural father, and this is quite to the standard of spiritual advancement. Now Brahmananda and yourself are a good combination. Try to organize our book selling department very nicely. That will be great service to the society and to the people in general. The books we are publishing are completely novel to the Western world. We are explaining the science of devotional service in so many ways, and __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ especially is unique literature that the people in general should try to understand. I have got an ambition to finish the __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ in the same way I have already done, so try to help me as far as possible to finish this high project. If we get return from the Iskcon Book Department, then we shall be able to publish all of our books very quickly. So Brahmananda and yourself will be a good combination, and Krishna desires that you should do it exclusively.

I hope this will meet you in good health, and I thank you once more for your letter and check.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
