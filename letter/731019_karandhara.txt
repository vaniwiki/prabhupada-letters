====== Karandhara ======

<card class="letter">
Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters both dated October 9, 1973 and have noted the contents very carefully. These things are happening in many corners of our organization. Today I received the same complaint from Kirtanananda, and the reply is enclosed. This is applicable everywhere. Unless we become very strong in Krsna consciousness, it is very risky to handle material things and business. We are naturally business minded, and so as we get some opportunity, that mentality becomes strong. We have already got our book-selling program. It is better not to divert to other lines of business. This boy Rsi Kumar appears to be lost coming in contact with business. I heard he was coming to India and staying in the hotel without coming to the temple. Similarly Hayagriva is also lost almost. So, the situation is not very favorable.

There is the story of the bed bug. In the winter season the bed bug appears to be only skin, but in summer season as soon as it gets the opportunity of biting and sucking blood, it becomes fatty. Sometimes we may artificially renounce the world, but as soon as the opportunity of sucking blood is there, we turn again into a bed bug. Therefore it is said in the Bhagavad gita:

> daivi hy esa gunamayi
> mama maya duratyaya
> mam eva ye prapadyante
> mayam etam taranti te
> [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]]

"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But, those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it."

Unless everyone of us sticks to the regulative principles of chanting, there is no other alternative than fall-down. That is a fact. I repeatedly say this, so if people do not follow, what can I do?

You cannot resign your position. You have to tolerate. Otherwise why does Caitanya Mahaprabhu say this verse:

> trnad api su-nicena taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amanina manadena kirtaniyah sada harih
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|(Cc. Ādi 17.31)]]

These things will happen, and we have to tolerate.

We shall talk over this subject matter seriously when I shall return to Los Angeles. Do not be worried.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
