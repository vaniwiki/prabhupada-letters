====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

Bombay

My dear Tamala Krishna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter dated 22nd July. It is very encouraging to note that the work on our BTG and other Books is going on. Actually producing and distributing books is our most important engagement, all other engagements culminate in this one end---distribution of books.

Anyway our festival here was very well received and I was so much encouraged by the whole thing that I was able to walk and dance the entire way from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square. The newspapers showed one picture of our Ratha next to the statue of Nelson and caption was "Krishna---a rival to Nelson". So all over the world our men are working hard to push this important message. I know that you are very hard working all the time and therefore your life is becoming perfect and sublime.

Thank you for helping me so much.

I hope you are well.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

As we are in possession of the land we must fully utilize it for our purpose. We must therefore hold Sankirtana Festival immediately and arrangement must be done with the help of all Hindu leaders like %%__%%, %%__%% etc.\\
