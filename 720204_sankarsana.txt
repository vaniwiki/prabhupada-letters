My dear Sankarsana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 22, 1972, and I am very much encouraged that you want to remain in Austin city because the people there are in desperate need of Krishna Consciousness. Actually, that is the mood of the devotee, that he is always concerned for the general mass of people, that they should stop their sinful activities and become delivered from the most dangerous conditions of life by taking to this Krishna Consciousness or devotional service. So I am very much pleased that you do not want to leave. Actually, that is our policy, once we enter a place, to sit down, then gradually to lay down and occupy everything! So because there is such good possibility there for preaching, especially in the university, then I am recommending that some men must remain there are work very hard to get a permanent center. If the preaching work is sincere, then there will be no lack either of temple or of devotees to fill it. Now you have sat down, and although you are squeezed a little tightly, if you push a bit harder there will be enough space, and very soon you will find yourselves laying down and occupying the big space!

I am especially encouraged that that professor has become my initiated disciple, and because he is very intelligent and has a good position of influence in the university, he can utilize this opportunity to serve Krishna very perfectly by influencing the intelligent students to take up this perfectional science. Also, he has got good income, so I don't see there is any difficulty there, in fact, very soon I think you enlist many students to help and have a thriving KC center. And if you like if I come to Dallas to see, I may also come there to speak to the students, as suggested by Sri Galim. Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
