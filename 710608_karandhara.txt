My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25th May, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far the small paperback edition of KRSNA book is concerned, we will not be getting it for six months at least. So go on distributing hardbound and, although I have ordered them (perhaps by now you have received the statement from Dai Nippon) if you think it is best, I can put it off for some time. Besides that, in India we are distributing only a few hundred KRSNA books out of 15,000 because they are being distributed only via life membership program. So we are getting the money but we are distributing only to life members. So under the circumstances if you think they should be returned to U.S.A. then you can let me know, because here they are being distributed very slowly.

For printing of course the priority is Bhagavad-gita. But the $20,000. given by the book fund for BTG should be replaced first of all. That is priority. You can go on depositing in the checking a/c no. 308161625, Bank of America, Pico-La Cienega Branch. All BTG collections and any book fund collections should be deposited so that you are able to repay at the rate of $5,000 per month. Any book distribution collections over and above that may be used for printing of the books, and as you see fit.

So far I know, the press is not competent to take outside work, as I know it by their past dealings. 10% per printing costs for maintenance needs, that was the arrangement, but if the maintenance costs have to be taken up by the book fund, that will be a white elephant problem.

So far I have got two tickets to return to L.A. and if more men are to return with me, I shall let you know.

Just now I have received one telegram from Brahmananda. He is in Karachi and I have advised him to come here immediately. So all the important men have come here already to India. So for Dayananda and family coming here, that is all right, but the incense department may not suffer in his absence. Actually we have need of many men in India, at least another 50 or 60. But they need not be important men. Assistant men will do nicely. So if you can arrange to send 50 or 60 men here for propaganda work in Calcutta and Bombay, that will be very nice. We require at least 100 of our American boys to make propaganda all over India. So Dayananda may come as the leader of another 50 or 60 men.

The proposition in San Francisco sounds all right, if Jayananda is willing to take the responsibility to make payments on the remaining $80,000 due.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
