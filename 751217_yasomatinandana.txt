My dear Yasomatinandana Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 11, 1975, I have noted the contents carefully. The program you have outlined is very nice, however I cannot go on long time procession because I am called by nature, I can go at most one hour.

So I shall come there on 25th morning.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
