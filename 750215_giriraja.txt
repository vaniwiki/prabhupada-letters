My dear Giriraja das,

Please accept my blessings. The interest rate here in the west is very low now, so I am thinking very seriously to invest about 410,000 dollars (approximately 32 lakhs rupees). I want to know immediately what kind of monthly interest I would receive if I was to put this amount in a fixed deposit for five years. Check with the big banks and find out what the highest interest rate would be. You can check with many of the big banks such as First National Bank, Punjab National, Central, Bank of India, State Bank of India, etc. Please see to this matter immediately without any delay and let me know by return post to New York Temple.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
