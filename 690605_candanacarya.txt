My dear Candanacarya,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of June 2, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding your proposal of working in Columbus with the chance of earning $100 per day, why don't you take it? This will be a great help to this center because there is such great potential for spreading our movement amongst the students there, and if we can either purchase the large church on 16th Avenue, or if they can purchase their present house, along with the nearby lot and gas station, that will be a tremendous asset to the activities there. I have seen in the gas station that there are two rooms, so if one room could be used for kitchen, then the other could be utilized as temple room, and the house would serve as an asrama for devotees. The first choice would be the big church, but if you can finance for purchasing either the church or the present site, that will be very nice service. So if you can actually earn $100 daily, I think you should take this opportunity. Please inform me what you have decided by return of post.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: I am enclosing a letter which I have received today from Sudama in Hawaii, so you can see the great possibility of propagating this chanting amongst the boys and girls of the Western World. I thank you for sending me wrist calendar. Pradyumna, I am anxious to know about the machines.
