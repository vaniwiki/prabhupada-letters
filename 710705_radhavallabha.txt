My dear Radhaballaba Das ([name redacted]),

Please accept my blessings. At the request of Sriman Hrdayananda Prabhu, I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. Your beads are chanted and they are enclosed herewith. I have given you the spiritual name Radhaballaba Das Brahmacari. Radhaballaba means Krishna, who pleases Radharani. Only Krishna can please Srimati Radharani, so He is known as Radhaballaba.

I am so glad to hear that you are working cooperatively with Hrdayananda Prabhu in our Gainesville center to push on this Krishna Consciousness movement. It is surely Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mercy that such sincere boys as you are helping me to fulfill the order of my Spiritual Master. I am doing the work of my Spiritual Master and similarly you also help me and we will all be benefited in Krishna Consciousness. So stay strong in Krishna's service by strictly following the regulative principles of devotional life, chant at least 16 rounds daily, read all our books, and if there are any questions you can refer them to Hrdayananda Prabhu. He is very intelligent boy. So together you work cooperatively to make our Gainesville center a grand success and I will be very pleased.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
