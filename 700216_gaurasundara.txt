My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10 February, 1970, and I am very glad to learn that you are planning to celebrate the appearance day of Lord Caitanya with a nice ceremony and installation of the Deities at the grand opening of the New Navadvipa Temple.

I will be very happy to come to Hawaii New Navadvipa for this occasion if you will make all the necessary arrangements for my passage, etc.

Regarding the tax exemption from the Internal Revenue Service, I understand from Gargamuni that it is already filed and you may apply as a foreign incorporation in the state of Hawaii. I have asked him to send you all the necessary papers in this connection as well as an explanation of procedure for filing for state tax exemption. I hope this information has by now reached you and you will immediately do the needful.

Hope this will meet you in good health, and please convey my blessings to Govinda dasi and all the boys and girls there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
