Dear Mike Gabbard,

Please accept my greetings. I have received your letter of January 28, 1977, and examined the contents.

Your idea for starting a Krsna Conscious center in American Samoa is very good, but first you must be well conversant with our philosophy and following all the principles. The best thing is to remain with us for some time and try to understand the philosophy. Just as one cannot teach others "do not smoke" if he himself is habituated to smoking, so we cannot teach the science of Bhagavad-gita, Krsna Consciousness unless we fully understand it, and practice it without any compromise toward any other philosophy. By associating with my disciples in one of our ISKCON centers you can learn all this very soon.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
