My dear Revatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your encouraging letter dated August 15th 1970.

I am very glad that you are all following the regular chanting of sixteen rounds daily very strictly. This schedule which you have made is very satisfactory, so follow the rules and regulations according to schedule and execute your duties in Krsna's service and everything will be alright. These regulative functions of chanting the rounds sixteen daily, rising early in the morning to attend Mangala Arati, holding classes for studying our scripture and going on Sankirtana, these items must not be neglected. They will quickly advance us in Krsna Consciousness and clear up all doubtful activities which have been causing mischief in our Society.

It is very good news that people are gradually taking more interest in your activities there by attending love feasts, classes, Arati and Sankirtana performances. In Japan they are doing nicely and similarly I have not good report from Los Angeles that they are doing nicely also, and in Boston also they are doing nicely.

Please offer my blessings to Bansidhari, Devarsi, Patraka, Divyasuri and Sriman Jim as well as all the other boys and girls.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
