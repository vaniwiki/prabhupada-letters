My dear Mahamsa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 12, 1974. Regarding the initiations I have accepted them as my disciples and their spiritual names are as follows:

Krishna das---Kauravesvara

Ravindra---Raghavendra

You may hold a fire sacrifice and chant on their beads and impress upon them they are taking vows before Radha and Krsna, the spiritual master, and the Vaisnavas. They must always chant 16 rounds daily and avoid the four sinful activities.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
