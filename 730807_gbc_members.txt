====== Letter to: GBC Members ======

My dear GBC Members,

Please accept my blessings. I find amongst the GBC members that Satsvarupa Maharaja stands first because he submits regularly the report. A sample copy is enclosed herewith. I hope all GBC Members follow in his foot steps.

I hope this letter meets you all in good health.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
