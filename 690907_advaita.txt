My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated September 3rd 1969 and your Vyasa Puja gift of 50 dollars. On Vyasa Puja day we had a very nice ceremony in the temple where the Vyasa Puja booklet was read aloud by Hayagriva, who is travelling with me during this European tour. On the morning of the same day there was an initiation ceremony held and two German brahmacaris, one English brahmacari and one German householder couple was initiated into this Krishna Consciousness Movement. This Thursday morning we shall be going to London, and they have arranged nice living quarters on the estate of John Lennon. After our business in London is finished, most probably I shall be returning to the USA via either New York or Boston. I hope that everything is coming along nicely in setting up the press in Boston, and please keep me informed as to your progress in this connection.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Balai, and your daughter, Nandini. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

PS: I have also received one check from Vaikunthanatha, so please offer to him my thanks in this connection.
