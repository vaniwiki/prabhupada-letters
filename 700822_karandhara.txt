My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 15th, 1970. Regarding shipping of the books, I hope you have already received message from Tamala Krsna. __Teachings of Lord Caitanya__ and KRSNA books should immediately be shipped by S.S. Viswa Kirti and the shipping documents may be sent to me directly at my Calcutta address as follows:

37/1 Hindustan Road Ballyganj Calcutta-29

Perhaps you know that we are starting for Calcutta on the 29th August reaching there on the same evening. One Japanese student also is going with me and he is helping our cause by translating from English to Japanese. He will continue his work as translator and it will be easier for him to understand intricate subjects in my presence.

Regarding __Isopanisad,__ I have already ordered Dai Nippon to reprint 10,000 with sewn binding (perfect binding). I thank you very much that you have sent $1,900 to Dai Nippon and they have acknowledged receipt. I heard from Tamala that you have sent further $1,500, but they have not received as yet. I hope by this time you have already sent this check.

I have invited some of the directors of Dai Nippon to take lunch with me today and I may inquire if they have received further money. The bill is already for $32,000 for the books which I have ordered to be printed and over and above this if the amount for KRSNA II and Hindi BTG is added the amount will come to somewhere about $53,000. So kindly go on sending weekly whatever collection you make for the Book Fund.

I am so glad to learn that the management of the Temple is going nicely and the devotees are feeling transcendental pleasure. I understand from Tamala that the number of weekly guests has almost doubled. This is very good news. Who is taking care of my apartments? It should be cleansed at least twice a week and on the Altar of the Deity at least one incense may be offered daily.

I thank you very much and all the devotees for offering me a garland daily as you were doing when I was physically present. If a disciple is constantly engaged in carrying out the instructions of the Spiritual Master he is supposed to be constantly in company with hs Spiritual Master. This is called __Vaniseva.__ So there are two kinds of service to the Spiritual Master One is called __vaniseva__ and the other is called __vapuseva.__ __Vaniseva__ means as above mentioned, executing the instructions, and __vapuseva__ means physically or personally rendering service. So in the absence of physical presentation of the Spiritual Master the vaniseva is more important. My Spiritual Master, Sarasvati Gosvami Thakura, may appear to be physically not present, but still because I try to serve His instruction I never feel separated from Him. I expect that all of you should follow these instructions.

Hope this will meet you in good health. Please keep me informed of your good activities always and offer my blessings to all the boys and girls and the little children.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. As this letter was being written, I have received your next letter dated August 19th, 1970, and thank you very much for sending the check for $2600 to Dai Nippon to be placed in the "Bhaktivedanta Book Fund Trust."\\
