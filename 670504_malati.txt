My dear Malati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter of the 25th, April 1967, and I am very glad to know the sentiment expressed therein. You are a very sincere girl and your sentiment is also very nice. One should always feel very humble, that will help one to make progress in Krishna Consciousness. So your humble feeling that you are shrouded by illusion is very nice, at the same time your feeling that Krishna Consciousness is so nice that it makes everything easy.

You have desired me to return to San Francisco by the 1st of June. If Krishna wishes it is not impossible. My program was to go to Montreal but there is some difficulty about the visa so I may not go to Montreal, and in case I do not go it will be not difficult for me to return by 1st June to San Francisco. If I am not there by 1st of June by the 1st of July I must be there. Thank you very much.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
