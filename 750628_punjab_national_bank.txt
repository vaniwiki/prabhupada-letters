Dear Sir:

Re: A/c No. 668 Vrindaban Construction Fund Fixed Deposit for Rs. 3,14,557.36 Date of Maturity 21/6/75

Regarding the above mentioned C.D. which matured on June 21, 1975, out of this 1 lakh of Rupees may be kept with you, and the balance should be renewed for Fixed Deposit for 3 (three) months.

The 1 lakh of Rupees may be kept in your custody, and you issue a letter of credit in favor of Sri Chanshyam das Agarawal of Murzaffar Nagar stating that on completion of the negotiation of selling his land to Mayapur-Vrindaban Trust he will get up to 1 lakh of Rupees when the conveyance deed is registered before the Registrar.

Thanking you.

Faithfully yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
