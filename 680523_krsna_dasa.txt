My dear Krishna das,

Please accept my blessings. I am receiving your twigs for washing my teeth very regularly and I thank you very much. What about Krishna's flute you attempted to prepare? I think you can prepare one silver flute and I am inserting measurement. It should be with golden relief work---raised embroidery-like designs---on the body of the flute. The length of the flute may be 5 inches, and it should be 1/4" thick. Now I shall be glad to know what is your credit balance in the bank. It may be that I may call you to go with me to India at any moment.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
