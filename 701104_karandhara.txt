My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your special delivery letter of 15 October, 1970, and have noted the contents with great pleasure. You are one of my most determined students and for this reason I think that Krsna is giving you all facilities for serving Him. It is most encouraging to me to see that you are spreading this movement so nicely and I thank you for this. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu has forecast that this Hare Krsna Mantra will be heard in every nook and cranny of the globe. He is God, so it will happen, that is a fact. So if we take advantage then we may take the credit, but if we do not someone else will.

You are right to just depend on Krsna. When He sees that you are sincere He will reveal everything to you. And this preaching work is your key to success in Krsna Consciousness; just see __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ XVIII, 68-69.

I think that you may distribute copies to all centers of the letter from the Mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, endorsing our S.K.P. program and giving us official permission.

I am interested to know how much you have recently deposited in the Bhaktivedanta Book Fund Deposit Account. Please continue to earn thousands of dollars for printing of my books and this will be a great honor for you.

No one has sent my $15 monthly maintenance checks. So I am asking you to please expedite this matter among your centers. They should send readily negotiable American Express checks rather than personal checks which take up to two months to clear.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
