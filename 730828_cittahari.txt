My dear Cittahari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 15, 1973.\\
On your recommendation I am happy to accept Brian Lloyd as my initiated disciple. His name will be Bhutanath das. You can instruct him on all matters of philosophy and regulative living, attending class, Sankirtana, book distribution. As president of the temple you have very much responsibility, so never forget that we are acting as agents for the Supreme Lord so our standard must also be perfect and then automatically anyone that comes in our company will become perfect in no time.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
