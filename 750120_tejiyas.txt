====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejyas das,

Please accept my blessings. Herewith please find the corrected copy of Gita Gana. Do the needful immediately. The bearer of this letter, Krishnagraja das, is going to Delhi on a mission to see the Home Member. So, give him all help in this connection. If you have got the Hare Krishna film, please make it available for his use.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
