My dear Tamala Krishna Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. So I have arrived here in Vrindaban, but so far the project is concerned, why the money is so irregular? Tejiyas reports that in the past three months you have sent Rs. 5,000/- and since then nothing. How will the project go on? So I think that the 3 lakhs from Birla may be dispatched to Vrindaban either the whole or part.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
