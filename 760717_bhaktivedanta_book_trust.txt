To whom it may concern,

Enclosed please find one postcard in Bengali from one sannyasi:

B.N. Niskincana Maharaja,

Sri Gaudiya Math,

Moti Nagar Lucknow 226004

He mentions that he gave Rs. 20/-at Mayapur for a Hindi magazine with the promise of receiving some future issues but as yet he has not received any. Please make inquiries and send him more copies of the Hindi magazine. Please take immediate action and inform him without delay.

Thank you,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
