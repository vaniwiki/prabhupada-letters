My dear Govinda Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice letter dated April 1, 1969, and I have noted the contents with pleasure. Your humble sentiments are very nicely expressed and I thank you for them. I have already written to Jivananda and Harsarani, and they are inclined to go to New Vrindaban but I have advised them to go to Hawaii after spending a short period in San Francisco training up the devotees there in Deity worship and Sankirtana Party. So you may correspond with them to make more definite arrangements. From Sudama's letter I can understand that some people are coming to your kirtanas, so try your best to develop your center and Krishna will surely help you. We have not brought your __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ here, but when I get opportunity, I will send you one volume one.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
