My dear Kulasekhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated from Amsterdam on October 26th, 1970. I am very glad that you have found travelling with Subala Swami inspiration to your Krsna Consciousness. That is very nice appreciation. It is also good news that you have found the improved atmosphere in our Temples after visiting and things are going on nicely everywhere. That is wanted.

I am requesting you to go to Boston, U.S.A., to work on our ISKCON Press because I know you are an experienced and expert press operator. Your services for carrying on the program of our ISKCON Press smoothly are very necessary. So you should plan for going there as soon as possible.

Regarding the recent upheavals in our Society, that business is finished, now we must all concentrate very carefully on the simple execution of our duty following the principles of regulation very strictly in our daily life. If you remain pure by following the instructions of your Spiritual Master there is no chance for maya to enter into the program. So I do not think you will find any more these politics at our Boston center or elsewhere. So please go there and help print our Society's literature, this is a great opportunity for rendering service to Krsna and the humanity at large.

You have asked what is a brahmacari's work? A brahmacari's work is __brahme carati__ or remaining always Krsna Conscious. You have mentioned singing and dancing, nothing else. Does it mean he will not eat? No.

Please keep me informed of your movements. Hope this will meet you in good health. If there are no other qualified brahmacaris to assist Subala Maharaja, then he must create some qualified men. That is the business of a Sannyasi.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
