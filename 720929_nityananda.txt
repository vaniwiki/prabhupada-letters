New Orleans

My dear Nityananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 23 and I have noted the contents with care. Yes, I shall be very glad to hear that you have installed these Lord Jagannatha deities in your New Orleans temple, and I can see from the photo that they are very nicely made. Now hold the ceremony as per the enclosed instructions. During the fire ceremony you can also give the sacred thread and Gayatri __mantra__ to Bhudara, which I am enclosing also herewith. Teach him to chant on the finger divisions and play the copy of the tape of me reciting Gayatri __mantra__ into his right ear. Also I am sending the beads for Michael Lightfoot, duly chanted by me, under separate post. So you may hold the fire __yajna,__ install deities, and give initiation to these two boys.

I am very happy to hear that the temple is improving more and more under your expert guidance. Now go on with our program and try to increase your attraction of Krsna Consciousness movement to the public and recruit local men more and more to become fixed up devotees of Krsna.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
