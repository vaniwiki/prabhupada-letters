My dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 9, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. My money is already invested in a Mayapur Trust Fund, so there is no possibility of lending you any money. Furthermore, in your absence I don't think there is need of very big house. If you make arrangements for purchasing two big, big houses and then go away, then that is not very good proposal. To purchase our own house in Los Angeles, London, these headquarters are required as permanent but we should not be very much anxious after purchasing many houses and properties. In future through out the society, it is better so far as possible that we should rent. Big house means big responsibility. So unless there are many men, and very big propaganda, buying house is risky and unnecessary.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Regarding the cars I am very much anxious to hear what is your progress in this connection. We must have some cars or vans for sending to India, so if you cannot get free we shall pay at 50% reduction or some big concession. And we shall advertise on the cars "donated by such-and-such company." That will be good diplomacy for them in India.
