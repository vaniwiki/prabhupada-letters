====== Letter to: Pannalal Bansilalji ======

Hyderabad

My dear Pannalal Bansilalji:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 19th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am advising my Bombay center with a copy of this letter to send you the latest amended copy of the Rules of the Society. It is not yet settled up as to those who will be the Trustees. When I return to India, I shall send you the list.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
