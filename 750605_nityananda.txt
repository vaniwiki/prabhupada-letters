My dear Nityananda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 31, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the nice photos. Your Deities are very nice there. Regarding my coming there, we shall see later on.

I have accepted Caron Dempsey for first initiation. Her name is Krsna-pujya devi dasi. Her beads can be chanted on by Satsvarupa Maharaja. Be sure that all of the devotees there are very carefully following all of the regulative principles and chanting 16 rounds daily and let them study the books deeply.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
