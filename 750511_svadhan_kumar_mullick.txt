My dear Svadhin Kumar,

I am in due receipt of your letter dated 1st Vaisakh, 1382. So, I am enclosing herewith one introduction letter to my disciple Bhagavata dasa, in care of our temple at #3 Albert Road, between Camac St. and Hungerford St. near the Hindu school. So, you can go there and present the introduction letter and he will do the needful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
