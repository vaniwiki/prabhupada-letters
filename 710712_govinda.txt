My dear Daughter Govinda Dasi,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good husband Gaurasundara and all the others there also. You will be glad to know that I have received your mangos just yesterday and they were so first class. Thank you very much. Now they are all finished. So I am thinking why you don't send one carton full of unripe mangoes here? That would be very nice. Whatever arrangements have to be made to ship mangos here, that is all right.

You are so kind and I am always thinking how nice devotees are you and your husband. Thank you very much.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
