My dear Sankara Pyne:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your Bengali letter date 4/11/73. I am glad to learn that my books are being read in the Calcutta University and the National Library and others. Go on in this way distributing as far as possible.

You can still advance in krsna consciousness even in the office by chanting and giving some percentage to the mandir. Our philosophy is that all the fruits of our activity go to Krsna for His enjoyment. It does not matter what our position may be.

Soon I shall be leaving India, but I shall return in March for Caitanya Mahaprabhu's Appearance Day, and I shall see you then.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
