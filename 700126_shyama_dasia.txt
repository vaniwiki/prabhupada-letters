My Dear Shyamadasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22nd March, 1970, and may inform you that confidential matters between you, husband and wife, may be settled up between yourselves.

But your foremost duty is to abide by the will of your husband. Your husband is not an ordinary boy-he is educated, intelligent, sober, and a devotee of Lord Krsna. Therefore, whatever he plans, you should follow.

To understand further on this subject matter, it will be better if you read Srimad Bhagavatam, Volume 3, page 832, Text 58.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
