My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 23rd, 1969 along with the press proof copy of __BTG__ #28. It is nice. Everyone here liked it. Simply the mistakes which you have already admitted may be corrected in the future. That is to say the headline should be broader and each page should mention the words "Back To Godhead". I think from next issue the editor's and co-editor's name should be mentioned: that is Hayagriva and Satsvarupa. At least officially there must be the editor's name there. I think that is required by the press act. You have received my letter dated 16th September, and I hope by this time you have made up my passbook in the bank. I am very much anxious to know the credit balance in my favor up to date. Regarding transferring my account to another branch, I think a simple letter to the present branch will be sufficient. When I transferred my account in the Bank of America from San Francisco to Los Angeles, I simply sent them one letter and everything was done. If you think that changing the branch is necessary, then I shall send them one letter on hearing from you. In the meantime, please let me know what is the correct credit balance in my favor.

Regarding MacMillan's letter, I have forwarded the same to Gargamuni and Tamala for consultation before final decision. I have not heard anything from them till now. If the matter is urgent, you can consult with them and whatever you all decide, that is my decision. Now, gradually I am trying to hand over the management to the reliable hands of my disciples, and you should all work by joint consultation, without any friction. Now, by the Grace of Krishna, we are expanding and we must work in such a way that our society may stand a solid institution. In this connection I shall request you not to circulate all my letters that I address to you. Letters are sometimes personal and confidential, and if all letters are circulated, it may react reversely. I have already got some hints like that with letters I sent to you regarding Kirtanananda and Hayagriva. So in the future please do not circulate my letters to you. All my letters to you should be considered as confidential, and if you want at all to circulate, you just ask me before doing so. I am glad that Dayananda has gone to electrify the press nicely, and things are going on smoothly there. I hope this will meet you in good health.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
