My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am sure that you know I have come to Germany via New York on Monday morning. It is understood from different sources that Rayarama has written you a letter complaining that the charge of __BTG__ has been taken from him without any justification. But the actual fact is that he was spending 600 dollars per month for maintenance of Iskcon Press with the result that the number of subscribers was only somewhere about 300. Most of the __BTG__s were being sold by our Sankirtana Party in Los Angeles. Anyway, the 600 dollars were to be saved for other useful purposes. Therefore, the staff engaged in Iskcon Press was dispersed, but Rayarama was there in his original position as managing editor. But since this expenditures was stopped, he is little bit sorry; so much so that he does not come regularly and practically he is inclined to give up our relationship. So I called him when I was in New York, but his attitude is different. I did not see him in the airport on my arrival or departure, neither did I see him at the function held on Sunday. So I think in the future you will have to take charge of managing BTG in consultation with Brahmananda when the press will be started in Boston. I have already decided to start the press, and I am glad to have your assurance that you will help in this respect, even with financial help.

I thank you very much for this straightforward offer.

Please let me know what is the position of the house at the present moment. You have promised to pay them 6,000 dollars down, and if it is possible, why not pay him the 6,000 down immediately. This will finish the transaction immediately instead of waiting for three months. I shall be glad to hear from you in details about this matter.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
