**Personal**

My dear Dr. Channa Reddy,

Please accept the blessings of Lord Krishna. I have been informed by my secretary, Gopal Krishna dasa Adhikari, that a new law has been introduced whereby income from temples is now taxed to the extent of 7%. He further informed me that several other religious organizations such as ours have received tax-exemption status. I trust that you will kindly provide our institution, being a purely religious and non-profit charitable organization, with the same facility of tax-exemption. Thank you once again.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
