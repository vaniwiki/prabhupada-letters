My dear Tejiayas,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of you letter from Vrndavana dated first September, 1972, and I have appreciated the contents with great care. I am especially encouraged that you are planning another wonderful festival of Hare Krsna festival in Delhi, and that you are trying to get again the LIC grounds. Then it will be first class. One thing is, Tamala Krsna has invited me to come to Hyderabad starting 17th November, and I have accepted his invitation. So I think you may begin the Delhi festival from 5th November and it must be finished by the 16th November, and then I can fly to Hyderabad on 17th as agreed with Tamala Krsna. Anyway, you consult with Tamala Krsna and Gurudasa and make the program accordingly. I am coming to Vrindaban by 15th October, and it is not necessary for me to stay the full month. I may stay up until the 6th and then go to Delhi for our pandal program there and then by the 17th fly to Hyderabad. So arrange in that way.

I have come to Dallas and it is very hot here, just like Calcutta. So you may see the factory of Hansraj Gupta and ask him to donate one dozen nice fans for our Dallas Center. But whether they have got fans to operate on the 110 AC voltage in America?

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
