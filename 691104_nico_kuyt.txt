My dear Nico Kuyt,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated October 17, 1969, sent from the Detroit temple. I am very much pleased to note your sincere attitude towards our Krishna Consciousness Movement, and this sincerity will lead you to the highest spiritual consciousness if you continue in this way. That is the special Grace of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In former ages the processes of spiritual elevation were very difficult and long enduring. But in this age of Kali Yuga our lives are so short and our minds are so restless that the process of spiritual realization must be very simple in order for success to be achieved. Therefore, Lord Krishna appeared on this world as Lord Caitanya to show the fallen living entities the easiest and most sublime method of achieving Krishna Consciousness. His formula is that everyone, in any position of life, should chant the Hare Krishna Mantra. So this is what we are teaching, and any benefit you are feeling from this procedure is simply the Mercy of Caitanya Mahaprabhu acting. I am glad that you are very much appreciating the association of Bhagavan das and Jagadisa. They are both very nice devotees, so when you have any questions about our philosophy, you consult with them, or else I am also at your service in this connection. Please continue to live at our temple, follow the regulative principles and chant at least 16 rounds daily. Most likely this December I shall be staying at our Boston temple for some days, and if it is possible, you may then come there to meet me.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
