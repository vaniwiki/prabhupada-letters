My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Please immediately send me the names and addresses of all the foreign devotees in India. Please also their passport numbers and nationality.

I am just now speaking with His Excellency The High Commissioner Rasgotra Maharaja Krishin and he has promised to help us with the devotees who are being harassed by the Indian authorities.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
