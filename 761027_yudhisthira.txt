My dear Yudhisthira,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1976, along with photographs of your farm. It appears very nice.

As far as the farm being authorized, you discuss with Kuladri and Kirtanananda Maharaja. Whatever they say I agree. Kuladri is an experienced man so you may organize things there taking his advice. Please just work sincerely and Krsna will bless you.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
