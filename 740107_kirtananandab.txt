Dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 30, 1973.

I was very pleased to hear your report of our cow protection program, and I had part of your letter read aloud to a group of devotees how you have one cow who will be giving 70-80 pounds a day. The cow is so wonderful and valuable in society. But you should also use the bulls by engaging them in tilling the ground. People may call this the primitive way but it is very practical for engaging the bulls---have them work in cart loading, transporting, etc.

Regarding Srutakirti, I proposed to him that he go to New Vrindaban but he said he did no like farm work and so he wants to go to Caracas and perform deity worship in the temple. So I have already asked him but I will say again, how you require him at New Vrindaban and how he should work nicely there with the cows, under your guidance.

You inquire whether you can make cheese? Why cheese? Make sufficient ghee. If you can send ghee to India that would be nice service as there is scarcely any ghee there. Cheese is not good. We should produce ghee so all our centers can have enough ghee.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
