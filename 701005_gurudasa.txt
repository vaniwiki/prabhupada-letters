Bombay

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings you all. You are welcome in India. Now my going to Bombay is postponed and my enclosed letter to Sri Bajoriaji will speak for itself.

Now if your preaching work in Bombay is going nicely, then you can stay there for some time and do preaching work as they are doing here in Calcutta. Otherwise, you can immediately come here and work jointly. We are expecting to have our own place by the end of this month. When you come, you should send a telegram with the details of your arrival.

If you interested to open a branch in Bombay, you can see the following gentleman and he will help you.

Dr. Ram Candra Pal

62, Keluskar Road

Sivaji Park Dadar

Bombay-28

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
