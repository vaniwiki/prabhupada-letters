Dear Shri Khilnani:

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 25.9.73 and I have immediately informed the man in charge in Paris to suspend the marriage. the copy of the letter to Bhagavan Das, the man in charge, is sent herewith.

So far education is concerned, our philosophy is:

> sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam
> arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma nivedanam
> iti pumsarpita visnau bhaktis cen nava laksana
> kriyeta bhagavaty addha tan manye' dhitam uttamam
> (Bhag. 7.5.23-24)

We consider one who is a devotee as being first class learned and educated. If you do not like your daughter being in Paris with the devotees, you can call her back. I have no objection. But, our mission is that everyone should be given the chance to become Krsna conscious. Many thousands of boys and girls in the Western countries are seriously taking to this movement sacrificing many things. Especially they do not indulge in illicit sex life, gambling, meat eating, and intoxication. I think your daughter is very fortunate to be amongst the devotees and living a very happy life. But, if you think it is not good, then you can guide your daughter. I have no objection. I am of course busy with so many things, therefore I have forwarded your letter for necessary action.

Faithfully yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

At a meeting for Janmastami in London I was present, and the Indian High Commissioner His Excellency Shri Rasagotra came to our temple amongst many thousands of Indians and Englishmen. If required you can inquire from him how this movement is going on in the Western countries.
