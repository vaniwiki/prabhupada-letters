My dear Jayadvaita,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 1l, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully.

Yes, in the future you should make sure that all the books, no matter what size or color, have the words Bhaktivedanta Book Trust under the logos. Whether it is clear or unclear it should be there.

Yes you are correct, when one associates with one who is in illusion or mislead naturally he will also become influenced by that illusion. So you must pray to Krsna to protect you from such bad association. Do not forget our most important business which is to develop pure Krsna Consciousness by following our strict regulations and Vaisnava standards, and always be engaged in service. Yasya prasadad bhagavata-prasadao, yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto 'pi, anyway by Krsna's grace everything is going on there very nicely. So you are one of the officers there, please continue working very enthusiastically and setting a good example for others.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
