Dear Trai Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your special delivery letter of July 17, 1973 and I have carefully examined the contents.

I am glad to hear from you that everything is in order at our Boston temple and that the house is nearing completion in repairs and rehabilitation. This will very much increase the prestige of our Boston center so that respectable people will come and sit and hear about Krsna Consciousness. Please do not worry regarding some rumors that were being circulated here by outsiders about the Boston ISKCON temple. I can understand the actual position from your letter; so please push on with all programs as you are doing.

Krsna Consciousness is factually the only solution to all the suffering which is besetting fellow humanity and all living entities. So we have great responsibilities in discharging our duties in devotional service.

I am enclosing one brahmana thread chanted on by me for Mathuresh das. You may play the tape of me speaking gayatri mantra into his right ear and instruct him in the duties of Brahmin. We have to be real Brahmins, not just in name, and in that way we can set an example for the whole civilized society to follow.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
