My dear Mrs. Tania Perera,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated nil. I have noted the contents carefully. Yes! I remember you and the gold chain you gave me I gave to the deities in Melbourne.

Regarding your situation, the only alternative is to move into the temple and take complete shelter of the devotees and Krishna. Prahlada Maharaja was only 5 years old and because of his becoming a devotee of the Lord his father tried to kill him in so many ways. So that your husband is against Krishna is nothing astonishing, it is quite normal. So if you like you can leave him, and move into the temple of your choice.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
