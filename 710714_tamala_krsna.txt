My dear Tamala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated after such a long time and I have noted the contents carefully.

I have handed your letter over to Syamasundara for a point by point reply, but one thing is that if it is not possible to get Indira Gandhi or the Governor or the American Ambassador for the festival at Mayapur, then what is the use? In that case, the program should be cancelled until some later date. My going there depends on whether such meeting can be arranged; otherwise there is no need in my going. I have got so much engagement here and have resumed my translating work also. So do your best to see that one of these big officials comes to Mayapur for the cornerstone ceremony and let me know as soon as possible what arrangements have been made.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. (1) By the 20th July I will be in N.Y. at least for a week.\\
(2) By the 1st August I will be in London.\\
(3) (?) please find one letter from Mr. Mukherji(?) & do the needful.\\
(4) If Bombay(?) management is going well, then Gurudasa may go there (?). Send me one letter weekly.
