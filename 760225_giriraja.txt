My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 10, 1976.

It is my intelligence and your cooperation that is working. There is a story of a man who was challenged whether he had any intelligence. He then began to look in his pocket. When asked why he was looking in his pocket, he replied, "if there is money, then there is intelligence". So you have gone so far to collect money and intelligently, but if there is no money, where is the intelligence? Both must combine, then everything works out nicely.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
