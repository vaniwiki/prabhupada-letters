My dear Mandakini devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 11th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your going to Moscow, if as you say, there is a chance of your getting a residential permit, then you should go there and try to get it. If your husband has a plan, that is very good. By Krishna's grace you may be able to stay there and spread Lord Caitanya's movement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
