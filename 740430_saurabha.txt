My dear Saurabha,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much anxious to know how far the residential quarter is constructed. Our deadline of completing the whole temple and residential building is the end of July. Whether it is possible? I want to know it definitely, before I go to Europe. You kindly send me immediately a detailed report. Otherwise, I will have to go there immediately and see how things can be completed by the deadline date.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
