====== Letter to: Gandharva ======

Seattle

My dear Gandharva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. If you like, you can come to India and live with me for some time. During Sri Caitanya's appearance day festival, if you like you can come and live with me. Then everything will be alright.

Please do not fail to chant 16 rounds, rise early, read my books carefully and follow all the regulative principles.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
