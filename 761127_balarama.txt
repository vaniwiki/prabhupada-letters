Vrindaban

My dear Balarama,

Please accept my blessings.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept the following devotees as my initiated disciples. Now hold a fire sacrifice and instruct the first initiates to always follow the four regulative principles and chant minimum of 16 rounds daily avoiding the ten offenses. Let the second initiate hear the tape of me chanting Gayatri in the right ear. Show him how to count on the finger divisions. Their beads and thread have been duly sanctified by me.

Bhakta Andre---Atmarama dasa

Edward R. Byrne---Brhaspati dasa

Heather Abbot---Hari dasi\\
second initiation---Visvahetu dasa

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
