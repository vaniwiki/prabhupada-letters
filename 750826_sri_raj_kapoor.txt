Dear Sri Kapoorji:

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 14, 1975 with enclosed check for Rs. 2222/- and Membership form. Sometimes in the year 1954 if I am correct I had the chance of meeting you in Jhansi. At that time I was trying to organize my movement with the help of some young men at the Bhakti Bhavan, Jhansi.

So after ten years of struggle, in 1965 I went to USA, and by the grace of Krishna it has become successful all over Europe, America, Canada, and Australia. As it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita; __yad yad acarati sresthas, tad tad evetaro janah, sa yat paramanam kurute, lokas tad anuvartate__ [[books:bg:3:21|(Bg. 3.21)]]. "Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.". Your donation to this movement and your becoming the Patron Member is a very great thing, and it will ensure others who will also follow in your footsteps. So I am very much grateful to you.

Please visit our Hare Krishna Land Juhu for Janmastami and Vyasa Puja Day on the 30th instant. I think the Mayor of Bombay will preside over the meeting.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
