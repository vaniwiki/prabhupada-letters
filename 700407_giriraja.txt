====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

Boston

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 25th March, 1970, recommending Michael to be initiated. I have duly initiated him and his beads chanted by me are returned herewith. His initiated name is Madhavananda Das.

I am very pleased to note that you are feeling everything is going on nicely in Boston due to the nice devotees. You are also a very nice devotee, so together work to make Boston center even nicer for the satisfaction of the Lord.

I have received your beads also, and I am returning them to you duly chanted. Now please increase your enthusiasm for pushing on this Krsna Consciousness movement and Krsna will inspire you with all intelligence for serving Him as much as you engage yourself with sincerity and devotion. Therefore to keep advancing in your spiritual power always be sure to chant at least the prescribed sixteen rounds of beads daily. This is the fundamental program for advancing more and more in Krsna Consciousness.

I do not know just what has happened to your old beads, but you should keep your beads always very, very carefully, they are your direct link with Krsna.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
