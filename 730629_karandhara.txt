My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 6/19/73 and I have carefully studied the contents.

As far as the $10,000.00 due from Syamasundara, he has come to me in Mayapur and he has promised to pay in July.

It is very encouraging to hear the arrangement you are making for worship of Their Lordships Sri Dvarakadhisa and Rukmini. Please do it very nicely and I shall be glad to see the completed result.

You will be glad to hear I am feeling 80-90% fit again. I am translating, lecturing and taking morning walk and eating regularly.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
