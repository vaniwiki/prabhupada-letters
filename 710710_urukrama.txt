My dear Urukrama (Jefferey),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter dated 7th July, 1971 and at the recommendation of both Bhagavan das and Bahulasva Prabhus I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. I can tell from your letter that you are certainly most qualified. You are very sincere boy and have been chanting your 16 rounds of beads regularly and strictly following all the regulative principles. Continue this program faithfully and your rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness will be certain. I have given you the spiritual name Urukrama Dasa Brahmacari. Urukrama is a name for Krishna and means one whose activities are glorious.

So go on with your devotional activities there in Chicago whole-heartedly and always depend on Krishna. Just like you said that you had been experiencing so many difficulties, but that is Krishna's mercy upon you to make you turn to Him more and more. So work cooperatively with Bahulasva Prabhu and make our Chicago center a grand success. That is my request to you, so work in that way with full enthusiasm. And stay strong in Krishna's service by regularly chanting your rounds, by reading our literatures, by going for Street Sankirtana, etc. In this way go on and you will be happy and your life will know success.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
