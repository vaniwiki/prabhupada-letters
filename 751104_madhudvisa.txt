My dear Madhudvisa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 21, 1975, and I thank you very much for it. Now I am getting old, so if you can do things without me, that will be a great pleasure for me. You are an experienced devotee and know how to manage things, and you have good men there to help you so I am sure that you can carry on things nicely. Still if I get the chance, I will come for the Ratha Yatra festival.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
