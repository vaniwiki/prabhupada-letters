My dear Subala,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 26, 1969, and I have noted the contents with pleasure. I am glad to learn that the Philadelphians are quickly taking some interest in our Krishna Consciousness Movement, and you are simply standing on the corner wearing robes and the people come to purchase copies of __Back To Godhead.__ So if you can continue in this way, letting them hear your chanting and selling __Back To Godheads,__ then all success is automatically there. I remember that my Guru Maharaja would often send young boys out to sell literature of Krishna Consciousness, and if they would come back having sold only a few issues, Guru Maharaja was very, very pleased. Now you report that you have sold 300 issues of __Back To Godhead__ in just a few days, so I know that Guru Maharaja is very, very pleased with your work. Actually, in all of our centers our Sankirtana Party and Krishna Consciousness literature is becoming more and more popular. Perhaps you have heard that Brahmananda has already made arrangements to increase the number of copies printed from 20,000 to 25,000. This is all very encouraging, so continue to increase your sales of Back To Godhead as far as possible. You are a serious worker, and Krishna will reward your efforts with success.

This Monday I returned from San Francisco where they performed the Rathayatra Ceremony, and it was tremendously successful. There were about 10,000 people who joined us for the day, beginning from 12:00 in the afternoon, and lasting till around 10:00 at night. All through the day these people were feeling the bliss of Krishna Consciousness through chanting, dancing taking Prasadam, watching puppet stories about Krishna, and hearing us speak on __Bhagavad-gita.__ The local papers printed nice pictures and stories about our Festival, and when we have them reprinted I will send a copy to you. Please offer my blessings to the others, and continue in the nice way you are doing now.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
