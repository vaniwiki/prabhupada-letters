====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

My dear Tejiyas das,

Please accept my blessings. I have five days ago safely arrived here in Los Angeles by the Grace of Krsna.

Since leaving India, I have not heard from you. Guru das has written that the work has stopped in Vrndaban for want of finances. What is the position of your collections in New Delhi? I am arranging to collect and send money from here for the Vrindaban project and I also want you to concentrate on collecting there. We want to finish this project as soon as possible so that we will have our Center firmly fixed up in Vrindaban. Kindly report to me the progress in this connection.

Regarding Mr. Aggarwal's offer to print our abridged __Bhagavad-gita As It Is:__ whether or not he is still serious for this proposal and have quotations for the production been taken? The price should not exceed Rs. 2 per book. The size may be reduced a little to meet this budget if necessary. We want to sell for Rs. 3 at most. This edition is especially meant for the student class. We can print and distribute in India but cannot export them. It will be better not to sell them through bookstores but rather direct to the consumer. The stock should be kept in our custody at our own warehouse.

How things are going on at our Delhi Center? There is a good opportunity for cultural discussion to be held there, especially amongst the foreigners, so try to arrange some programs.

There must be feasting also, if not weekly then at least occasionally. All our life members and patrons should be invited. For example Mr. Bridge Mohan Chandiwalla who recently donated Rs. 5,000 is very favorable so we must endeavor to keep his sympathy and support.

You may inquire from Mr. Kilnani, who was previously a commissioner in Germany, what is the procedure for bringing one automobile into India. Recently he has imported his Mercedes Benz so we also have an auto we want to take to India. How to go about it?

Kindly reply soon bearing all news.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
