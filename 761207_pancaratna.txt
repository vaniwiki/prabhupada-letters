My dear Pancaratna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2nd November, 1976.

Yes, try to make Bhagavata Darsana a regular monthly journal. We have got enough material. Simply it has to be translated to Bengali. Either from old Back to Godheads or from our books.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
