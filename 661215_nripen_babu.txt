Sri Nripendra Natha Banerji\\
Late Principal of Kanyakubja College\\
Elliot Road. Birpur.

My dear Nripen Babu,

Kindly accept my greetings and blessings of Sri Sri Radha Damodara Dev Thakura. I hope everything is going well with you.

Since I came to America I desired to write you letter several times but I forgot your address. I wrote several letters to your brother at Vrindaban but I have received no reply from him. I do not know why. I am therefore writing to you although I do not definitely your address. I do not know whether you will receive this letter and still I hope this will reach you and I hope you will kindly reply this letter promptly.

Since I have come to America in September 1965, I have traveled many parts of the country specially Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Butler, Slippery Rock, Monroe, Boston and now I am situated in New York the biggest city in the world. I have started a small Ashram at the above address and young American students are taking very great interest in the philosophy of Vaisnavism based on the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. My books are selling here and I have published many small books also since I have come here. My fortnightly magazine "Back to Godhead" is also being regularly published and my lectures and kirtana have been recorded in Phonograph. The important papers have given me publicity and things are growing nicely. I have established a Society here under the name and style INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS INC and the Trustees of this society are all American and my disciples. They are going purchasing house in New York and as soon as the house is purchased I shall establish in New York a Temple of SRI SRI RADHA KRISHNA for the first time. Sir Padampat Singhania of your city of Kanpur was ready to spend lakhs of rupees for this temple in New York but Govt. of India did not sanction exchange from India. So I am trying locally to start the temple and most probably I shall be successful to start one not only in New York but also one in California and the other in Montreal (Canada) in both cities there are my disciples who are already working there. I hope you will be pleased to learn about considerable success in my preaching activities.

Now one thing I beg to draw your attention is the __Rupanuga Para Vidya Pitha__ which I wanted to start in Vrindaban within the vicinity of Radha Damodara Mandir. If it is possible to get some vacant land for constructing the building. My American students are ready to spend for this and I think if you give some land on lease terms, then I can immediately begin the work. Perhaps you may remember that when I first came to your temple, this was my proposal and both yourself and Gauracandra Goswami agreed to this. Later on when I wanted to do the work your brother indirectly declined. So I did not attempt any thing. Now I am serious about this building and if you so desire you can give me some land on lease terms. Of course there is ample land in Vrindaban to start this institution, but my aim is to start it in the land of Sri Sri Radha Damodara Temple which I think is very good for every one concerned. I want to start a nice International Institute at the place of Srila %%__%% Goswami is silent on this point and therefore I am writing to you. The idea is very good and I hope you will appreciate it. Any way it is up to you to accept the proposal or reject it but I shall be glad to hear from you about your honest opinion on this. My mission is develop the glories of Srila Jiva Goswami all over the world and I think you should cooperate with my honest endeavour.

Kindly reply this letter promptly if you receive it. I shall be glad to hear about your sons. Specially your youngest son. How he is feeling in the absence of his beloved mother. I hope you are taking proper care of the boy. He is very intelligent. If you so desire I can help him in getting education in some of the American institutions for being great scholar in any line. Thanking you in anticipation and awaiting your early reply. Hope you are well. With my regards I beg to remain,

Yours very sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.

I do not wish to disturb the position of the sevaits of Radha Damodara Temple, but simply if I am given the facility to live there with my disciples, it will be my pleasure to serve Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Damodara to my best capacity. Now it is up to you all sevaits to decide on this fact.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
