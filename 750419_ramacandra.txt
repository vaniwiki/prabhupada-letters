====== Letter to: Ramacandra ======

Caracas, Venezuela

My dear Ramacandra dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil, and I have noted the contents. Please try your best to come to our temple in Caracas and to follow all of the rules and regulations very carefully. Follow the advice of the devotees there and in this way you can make nice spiritual advancement. Do not try to concoct your own method for developing Krishna Consciousness, simply do as the disciples are doing in our center.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
