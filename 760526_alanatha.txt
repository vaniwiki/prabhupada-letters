====== Letter to: Alanatha ======

Stockholm

My dear Alanatha das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 7, 1976, and I thank you for the copy of Easy Journey to Other Planets in the Finnish language. Now go throughout all of Europe with your travelling party and distribute my books profusely, just as the Radha-Damodara TSKP is doing in America. You must remain strong by following the four regulative principles, and chanting 16 rounds of japa daily, and go on distributing my books unlimitedly in Europe.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
