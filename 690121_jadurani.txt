My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your undated letter, and also I have seen the nice pictures which you have completed for the "Krishna" book. I was very gratified to see your expert touch in these paintings, and also convey my thanks for Joy Fulcher for her very nice efforts.

Regarding Madhavi Lata, it is very difficult to get her to be fixed up into doing constructive work, so I gave her so many paintings to do to get her to utilize her talents in Krishna Consciousness. If you would like her to help you in the paintings for the new book, then it is all right, but you must deal with her very tactfully. Best thing is that I send suggestions for pictures directly to you, and whichever picture she will do, let her do it. In this way, you can give her one or two pictures. In the meantime, you and Joy may finish the rest of the pictures, and if she does not finish her assignment, then again you may do it yourself. Certainly she is talented artist so try to help her be engaged in this way.

Please convey my blessings to the others there. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
