====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

Bhopal, India

My dear Tamala Krishna Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I am now here in New York temple where things are going on very nicely, but I am anxious to have from you the report of the Bhopal activities. Please write to me here at your earliest.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
