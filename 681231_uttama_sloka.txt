[TEXT MISSING]

of December 24, along with your nice %%_%% which I have read with pleasure. I have already explained in Sivananda's letter %%_%%. I will send you a letter and certificate to alleviate your draft difficulties, and I will do the same for you. So there will be no need for you to plan to leave in few months. I have seen your poetry and it is very nice. Try to write more and to have it published. If you like, I can send you more topics to write poetries about and to versify into the German language. Try to translate articles for a German edition of Back To Godhead, which you can arrange to be printed in Hamburg, as they are printing a French edition from our Montreal center.

Somehow or other you should dedicate your life for developing your Hamburg center. If you still like, you can marry in the future, but for the present continue with brahmacari life so far as you can. This brahmacari life can be continued only by deep absorption in Krishna Consciousness. Don't be disturbed in your mind. I have sent a letter to Sivananda to stay there and conjointly work with you and Krishna das in progressing the success of the Hamburg center.

I hope that this finds you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
