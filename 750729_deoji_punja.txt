====== Letter to: Deoji Punja ======

Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Deoji Punja:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 28, 1975 with enclosed plans for the Fiji temple. Regarding the land, if it cannot be transferred then you should give the use of the land to ISKCON with a formal lease for 99 years with an option to renew. Your purpose that the land cannot be transferred will be served because a temple on leased land cannot be sold or transferred. So your purpose will be served. ISKCON is locally registered with yourselves as the incorporators, and the lease can be made. So do the needful. The adjacent land, that can also be purchased. The money can be collected locally.

Regarding my coming there, yes I shall go there again and again because there is temple there. I was always thinking of how Fiji can be developed and organized. It is a nice place.

Regarding the plans you sent, it is not clear whether the front stairway leads to the temple or the first floor rooms. There should be a space for a large kitchen for preparing mass prasadam. The first floor kitchen seems too small for this purpose.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. There should also be one pujari room for keeping the Deity paraphernalia nearby the Deity.\\
