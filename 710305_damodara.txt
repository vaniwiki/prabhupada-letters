My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 8th January, 1971 and have noted the contents. Yes, you may like to know that I shall be returning to the U.S.A. by the first week of April. There are so many devotees who have been recommended for initiations by the temple presidents. So when I return I shall initiate them all. At that time, Nolen Prabhu may also become initiated by me. He certainly sounds qualified. Please offer him my blessings and thank him very much for his very kind letter enclosed along with yours.

Here in India our program is going on very nicely. Especially we are making so many life members. That program is so important that we are getting money, supporters and distributing our literature all at the same time. But any way we can distribute our books is good because anyone who reads our KRSNA book, TLC, NOD, and Bhagavad-gita As It Is, is sure to become a Krishna Conscious person. It is a most valuable service to Krishna to distribute these books.

Please offer my blessings to Tosana Krsna, Patita Pavana, Nolen, Rot, Robert, Robbies, Larry, Mrganetri Devi and Chris Prabhus. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
