Dear Sir,

I beg to inform you that Sri Sanjib Banerji manager of the United Bank of India, has advised me to see you between 1 to 2 p.m. and he has told me that he had telephonic conversation with you about me. I have come from Vrindaban on a missionary purpose and the necessary papers in this connection are enclosed herewith. Please find. Sri Banerji has spoken very high about your good-self that you are highly interested in the matter of propagating the cult of devotion and the message of Vrindaban.

The present Vrindaban city is the excavation of the six Gosvamis headed by Srila Rupa and Sanatana Gosvamis who were deputed by Lord Caitanya to re-establish the Bhakti cult and inexecution of the order of Lord Caitanya the six Gosvamis lived there made a vast research in the Sastras and left behind them a vast literatures of pure Bhakti cult to be broadcast all over the world by later Acaryas. As such my Spiritual Master Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Goswami Maharaja made a great effort to execute the order of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and we were fortunate enough to meet Him for service. Apart from his various uncommon activities in the line, He was kind enough to order me to propage the same cult in English language to preach the cult in the foreign countries and in obedience to His order I am trying to do my bit. What I have done so far will be spoken by the enclosed papers. But I am practically struggling very hard for this job without any tangible success till Sri Sanjib Banerji has told me that you are the right person to co-operate with me in this noble task for propagating the Bhakti cult and combined in the message of Sri Caitanya Caritamrta.

The hearing tendency is made easy and still more favorable by songs and music of spiritual value to be equally shared by all classes of men namely the highest educated and the lowest illiterate. The movement is sublime and easy at the same time.

The League of Devotees is registered to make this movement in an organized way and I wish to enquire if any co-operation and help can be expected from your honour.

Awaiting an early reply and thanking you in anticipation.

Yours faithfully,
