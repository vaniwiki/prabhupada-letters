My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 16, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I am very much happy that you are convinced of this Krishna Consciousness movement and philosophy, and that you are sincere to manage everything in a spiritual manner just pleasing to Lord Krishna. When I shall come to Los Angeles by 20th May we will fix up some program for going to San Diego, if you desire that I shall come there. If your Hare Krishna Festival is held at that big big university at the end of May, I may attend, why not?

So far the meaning of the word "cheating," there are only three things to be known, that Krishna is the Supreme Enjoyer, the Supreme Proprietor of everything, and the Supreme Friend of everyone, and we say that honesty is acting upon the knowledge of these three facts. So if one is always acting under these three facts, knowing Krishna to be the Supreme Proprietor, Enjoyer, and Friend, then he is truly honest, and if one is not acting in this knowledge, then he is always cheating or being dishonest. So if you apply this to your techniques for selling literature to persons in the Sankirtana party, then you will understand what is the meaning of the word "cheating."

Hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
