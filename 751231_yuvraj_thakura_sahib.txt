Sri Yuvraj Thakura Sahib,\\
Sanand Palace,\\
P.O. Sanand, Dist Ahmedabad,\\
Gujarat

My dear Yuvraj Thakura Sahib,

Please accept my blessings. I am prepared to organize Gujarat by traveling village to village. You said that you could help me in this respect and also supply a car. So as soon as it is ready I shall accept, please let me know.

I thank you very much for your kind hospitality for me and my disciples while I was there. With my blessings for your family.

I hope this letter finds you and your good wife well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
