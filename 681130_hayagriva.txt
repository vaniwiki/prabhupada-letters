My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of Nov. 24, 1968, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very much pleased to hear of your good reports of OSU Yoga Society---it is very much encouraging to me. I have also appreciated your tape, and I shall return it to you in due time. I have only one.

Regarding the press you are thinking to purchase, yes it appears to be a very good opportunity. It may be that in the future we shall also purchase one offset press, but in any case, this is a good opportunity for buying this sort of press, so I think you should purchase it.

So far your marriage idea, I think you should marry, and all questions concerning this we shall discuss when you come here to visit me on the 13rd of December. It will be very nice that you shall visit here for your vacation, and I shall be very happy to talk with you again.

Regarding the boys, I shall ask their mother, Silavati, to open correspondence with you, and you write to her also. She is presently here in Los Angeles, along with one of her sons, Birbhadra das Brahmacari, and her other son, Girish das, is in San Francisco under care of Aniruddha das Brahmacari.

Thank you once more for your letter, and I shall be looking forward to your visits after December 13rd, and shall be very happy to see you. Please keep me informed of your activities there, and I hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
