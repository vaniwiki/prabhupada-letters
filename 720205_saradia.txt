My dear Saradia dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 26, 1972, and I am very upset to learn the news of that incident in Trinidad. Yes, you are right to stay away from such a place, and there is no harm if husband and wife live separately for some time. I do not know if there is good possibility in Trinidad for preaching. If, as you say, you are only preaching among the Indians there, then I think they may not be taking up this philosophy of Krishna Consciousness very seriously, and in that case there may be better scope for you and your good husband to open a center in Europe, as requested by your brother, Krishna das. But if the people of Trinidad are very seriously interested in our ISKCON Movement, then we should remain there and expand our preaching work. In either case, if there are some brahmacaris interested to go there and help, and if you think your husband Vaikunthanatha can be spared for preaching in Europe, I have no objection. You should consult with the GBC men I have chosen to decide these matters of management.

I hope this will find you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
