Dear Sir;

Please accept our prayers for your well being. Our society wishes to thank you for your kind cooperation in the past, regarding CCP application and import of books.

As before, we wish to reiterate that the religious books received from either Japan or our New York Press, are gifts, and there is no intention to sell these books in India, nor is there any question of foreign trade in any of our activities.

Again we are applying for CCP application for shipment of books statement enclosed worth Rs 50,000/- and we will be most happy if you advise and cooperate with us as you have already done.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
