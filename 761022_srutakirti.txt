My dear Srutakirti,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 10, 1976.

Since Tamala Krsna, Gurukrpa, Ambarisa, and yourself are all in agreement to develop the restaurant in Hawaii rather than in Boston, I have no objection.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
