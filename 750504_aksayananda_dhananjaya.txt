Vrndavana

Dear Aksayananda Swami and Dhananjaya,

Please accept my blessings. The bearer of this letter, Sri Munnalai, the driver for Mr. L. S. Agarwal, should be given nice facilities for himself and his family at our Asram when he comes to Vrndavana for pilgrimage. He would like to stay with us very much so see that full prasadam as well as a room is given during his stay in Vrndavana.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
