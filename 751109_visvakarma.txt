My dear Visvakarma das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 3, 1975 with the enclosed statement about Van Maharaja. So I have now issued orders that all my disciples should avoid all of my godbrothers. They should not have any dealings with them nor even correspondence, nor should they give them any of my books or should they purchase any of their books, neither should you visit any of their temples. Please avoid them.

I have received your telegram that you have purchased the church which I have seen when I was there in Toronto. So this is very good news. Please send me the details.

Upon your recommendation I am accepting Rodney Mort as my disciple and his name is Jitakandarpa. I also accept Nakadi das Brahmacari for brahminical initiation. Enclosed is his thread and mantra sheet. So you should hold a fire sacrifice and lecture on the importance of following the rules and regulations, chanting 16 rounds and all the devotional principles. This is your responsibility as the president of the temple. You must do it yourself and see that they also do it. This is the perfect way of teaching.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. What about that devotee from England who was to come to India? When I was in Toronto you agreed to send him. Now he is immediately required here in Bombay for construction supervision. I received your cable that you have purchased that church. Congratulations. What are the details? My blessings to Mr. Batra. ACBS\\
