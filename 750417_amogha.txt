My dear Amogha dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated 2-4-75 and have noted the contents. I am also hoping that you will be able to print our books in that part of the world in the local languages. I think there is a Dai Nippon branch in Jakarta. It is a great service to sell our books to educational institutions. The more you do this, the more you become recognized by Krishna. Take standing orders, as much as possible. If you can induce any of these educational institutions to invite me, I shall go there to speak amongst the educated persons. Please continue your good work with added enthusiasm.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
