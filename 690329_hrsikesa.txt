My dear Hrsikesa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of March 21, and have noted the contents carefully. No, I think the letter you sent formerly must have been lost, or missing in the mail. So I have sent your draft letter duly, and the copy of which is enclosed here with.

I thank you very much for your kind appreciation of "Govinda" my new record album. I am very much happy to hear your kind appreciation, and it is very much encouraging to me.

So I hope you are all well there, and very happily executing Krishna Consciousness. I will be very anxiously awaiting to see you all in mid-May, and then we shall talk at length on so many Krishna Katha topics,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
