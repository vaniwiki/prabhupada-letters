My dear Badrinarayana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 27/10/74 and have noted the contents carefully.

I am always happy to hear of the wonderful activities of spreading Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's sankirtana movement. Your activities are very pleasing. Going door to door, person to preach the message of chanting Hare Krsna is actually the yuga dharma for this age. In other yugas there are different processes for self-realization but in kali-yuga the real method is simply chanting Hare Krsna and trying to encourage everyone else to do the same. So your program is perfect. It is very nice that you are also making so many new devotees. This is the fruit of our activities. So continue your program in the same way with added enthusiasm and your life will be perfect.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
