====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

Delhi

My dear Tejiyas Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1973 and have noted the contents. Regarding your new place, yes, if many more devotees actually remain there, it is a good scheme, but as we have got four or five branches in India I do not wish to increase more centers. Indians are not joining. This is the deficiency of our movement. Only mediocre Indian men are joining and not the very intelligent class of Indians. But, Delhi is a nice place. Formally you proposed Sundar Nagar. What happened to that? If the book distribution facility is there, then it is a first class place. The more we distribute books, the more we get solid ground of preaching work. So far continuing the Deity worship after the festival, that is a very nice proposal. Try to give it a shape.

So between 20th to 25th instant I am coming to Delhi for going to Vrindaban. So I may stay in Delhi for one or two days, and then come back from Vrindaban during the festival. In the meantime please inquire if from Delhi to Nairobi there is any flight 747.

Bali Mardan is trying to get me a Mercedes car. So he has asked me who will be in charge of it in my absence. So I have suggested your name. So I think in the new building there is garage also.

Another thing, I want a diplomatic passport. Please inquire in this because I am always travelling, and this kind of passport will facilitate my travelling. I am a preacher of Indian culture, why they should not give me this kind of passport.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
