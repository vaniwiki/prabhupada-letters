My dear Citralekha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear how nicely you are attending the Deity. Please continue this activity along with your other godsisters. The more you beautify the Deities, the more your heart will be beautiful and you will understand Krishna Consciousness very distinctly.

Yes, the bumblebee is very much favored by Krishna and Radharani. Sometimes the bumblebee is taken as a messenger by Radharani and she rebukes the bumblebee because the bumblebee is blackish and Krishna is also blackish. Still, in spite of all rebuking, the bumblebee tried always to touch the Lotus Feet of Radharani. Therefore the bumblebee is to be offered our all reverence and respect. So please try to attract always the bumblebee by sufficiently decorating the Deity with flowers.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
