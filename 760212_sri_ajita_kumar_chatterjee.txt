Sri Ajita Kumar Chatterjee\\
Calcutta

My dear Ajita Kumarji,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7th February, 1976.

The message of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu was to give the same message as Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita: "surrender to Krishna". The pastimes of Radha-Krishna relationship are confidential and are not for the distribution to the ordinary public. Caitanya Mahaprabhu used to discuss with Svarupa Damodara, Ramananda Ray, Sikhi Mahiti, but not publicly. Ordinarily he was chanting the Hare Krishna mantra with ordinary devotees at the Jagannatha temple. So I think you should not discuss Radha-Krishna pranyayavikritih openly among ordinary conditional souls.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
