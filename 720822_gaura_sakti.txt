My dear son,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 22, 1972 requesting initiation, and upon the recommendation of Madhudvisa Swami, I have gladly consented to give you Gayatri mantra. This second initiation is very, very serious business, and you must become very strong and firmly situated in devotional service, and stick rigidly to chanting at least 16 rounds daily, without fail, and following the regulative principles without any deviation. This things will insure that you will be protected from Maya, and that your life will be successful and in the end you will go back to home, back to Godhead. I was very pleased with the Deities when I was there. So I request you to continue, along with Dipak, to render sincere, regular, loving service to Their Lordships, and They will give you all blessings. I have given you the spiritual name Gaura Sakti das Brahmacari. Now you continue, as you have been, to give Madhudvisa and the others all help, and spread this great movement all over Australia.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
