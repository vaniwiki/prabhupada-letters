====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

Brooklyn

My dear Tamala Krishna Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 8, 1974 and have noted the contents. Your letter was forwarded from Bombay, but the letter from Ramesvara was not enclosed.

Regarding Sankirtana and book distribution, both should go on, but book distribution is more important. It is brihat kirtana. In Tokyo airport one boy had come up to me asking if he could speak with me. I said yes, and then he asked me "Swamiji, where do you get all that knowledge in your books?" Of course it is Krishna's knowledge, not mine. But the effect is there. So for wider kirtana book distribution is better. Book distribution is also kirtana.

Regarding making hundreds of travelling parties, yes do that please as far as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
