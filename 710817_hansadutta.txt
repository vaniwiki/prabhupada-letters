My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. In further reference to my letter dated 14th August, 1971, I understand from Syamasundara that you have engaged all our Sankirtana members of Amsterdam to work in a cigarette factory. I do not know how you could dare to do this without asking me or any other GBC members. Amsterdam is doing nicely in Sankirtana Party collections; why they should go to work in a cigarette factory? In your last letter to me also you tried to impress me that everyone should go to work. That is not our principle. Our principle is not to work like the karmi or under a karmi. We are not sudras. Sudras are meant for working under somebody, not brahmanas. If you do not know this principle, you should know it now. All our men living in the temple are basically brahmanas. Otherwise, why they are offered sacred thread?

We should live on the paltry income, whatever we receive, by selling our magazines, but in dire necessity when there is no other way we may accept some service temporarily. But on principle we should go on Sankirtana, not work, and whatever Krishna gives us we should accept on that principle. You are a senior member of the society. You should have known all these things. Anyway, send them back on Sankirtana. All Amsterdam devotees should be engaged in Sankirtana, not in a cigarette factory.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
