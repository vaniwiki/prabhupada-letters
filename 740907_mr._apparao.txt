Dear Mr. Apparao;

Please accept my best wishes. I thank you for your letter dated nil and I am very glad to note your enthusiasm for becoming Krishna conscious. Actually we can see that by so much material endeavor, no one is becoming satisfied or happy. Rather the world is becoming a more hellish place to live. Therefore one who is able to take to Krishna consciousness is considered the most fortunate of men. To help people in this regard I have established my temple all over the world. Presently we have established a nice center in Hyderabad where you can take full advantage of the temple life. There you will be able to purchase our books, attend kirtana and lectures and take Krishna prasada every day. Our temple president Mahamsa Swami will be able to completely guide you. He will be able to engage you in Krishna's service.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
