My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter. I understand that some girls have volunteered to type and therefore you can now get the revised Gitopanisad nicely and correctly typed before it is handed over to the press. I am advising Rayarama to send you the sixth and seventh chapter for editing and I shall take with me the balance for re-editing and Typing. I am reaching San Francisco by the Second week of June 1967. Hope you are well.
