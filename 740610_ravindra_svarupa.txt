My dear Ravindra Svarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 5, and I have carefully noted the contents.

I am glad to hear you have immediately stopped political campaigning on receipt of my letter. I have written a number of letters to the persons involved explaining how we can not spend money and manpower on this project in competition with the big politicians. Therefore I have asked that it be stopped.

I want to thank you a hundred times for the excellent way you are worshiping the Deity there as I can see from the color photographs you have sent. From my very childhood I was also worshiping Lord Jagannatha. When I was six years old my father gave me a ratha and I was performing the Ratha yatra in my neighborhood. And now in the western world you are worshiping Lord Jagannatha so gorgeously and it pleases me very, very much. Thank you again for the way you are conducting the deity worship in the Philadelphia temple. As for the Ratha ceremony, you go on with it, I shall attend there next year. But you go on holding a splendid ceremony for the people of the city. I am sure it will be a success.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
