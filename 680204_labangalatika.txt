My dear Labangalatika dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your nice letter of January 28, and I thank you very much for it. The proper spelling of your spiritual name is LABANGALATIKA. The meaning of Labangalatika is delicate, sometimes Radharani is addressed as Labangalatika.

Please continue in your nice service attitude and Krishna will always be pleased with you. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Send through Hansadutta
