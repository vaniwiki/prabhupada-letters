My dear Mantrini devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your offering of July 27, 1976 of 108 pounds and I thank you very much for it. Actually you are correct, it is not possible for the disciple to repay the debt to the spiritual master. Therefore the disciple remains eternally indebted to the spiritual master and continually works in such a way that the spiritual master may become pleased upon him for such sincere services rendered. Always follow the four principles, take prasadam, and above all chant your sixteen rounds a day, and thus you will make steady advancement in devotional service. Continue to preach this movement all over the world and thus you will become happy and you will make others happy also.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
