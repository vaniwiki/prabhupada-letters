My dear Dixit das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5th February 1976 and I thank you for it.

Regarding your desire to preach in Hindi and English, that is very nice. My suggestion is that you purchase one or two rooms in our Vrindaban centre. The price is Rs. 50,000 for one room or 60,000 for two rooms and you may have your choice of commodes. Thank you very much for your inquiry.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
