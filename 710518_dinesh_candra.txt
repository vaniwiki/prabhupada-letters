My dear Dinesh Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 24th April, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Also I have received one letter from Yacov Shames and he acknowledges that he has been corresponding with you in regards to opening one branch there in Jerusalem.

It is very much encouraging to note that you have made final arrangements for going to Jerusalem on 2nd June, 1971, accompanied by one brahmacari. You all have my full blessings and may Krishna help you all in this noble venture. Just as soon as you arrive there, you can let me know. Most probably I will be starting for U.S.A. via Bombay, by the beginning of June. First I shall go to London and then on to USA.

Presently in Calcutta we are holding a huge "Hare Krishna Festival" in which 35,000 to 40,000 people are attending daily for hearing discourses on Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. We are distributing prasadam also. It is so much enlivening to see how the people are being so receptive to this message. It is all Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mercy.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Krsna Devi. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
