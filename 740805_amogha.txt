My dear Amogha das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 16, 1974 with enclosed clippings and the Christian paper Southern Cross. The articles are very nice, and I am very pleased how the Christian community are appreciating our movement. Actually we have no quarrel with them. We accept Lord Jesus Christ as the son of God and he was a great Vaisnava. Because he appeared in another country does not mean that we should not offer him respect. If we stick to our principles as I have given you, more and more these priestly class they will come to respect us and appreciate something of our philosophy. Therefore I stress so much the devotional rules and regulations.

I very much liked the report of the prasadam distribution at the club for businessmen. So I thank you very much for kindly sending me this report. I understand that you are preparing to go to Jakarta for preaching. So just go on as a sincere servant of Krsna, and you will be blessed by Krsna.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
