My dear Purusottama,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter (undated), and I have noted the contents carefully. Krishna is so sublime and transcendental that He cannot be realized by mental speculation or by personal endeavor, education, or material acquisition. He can only be approached and understood clearly by our service attitude, engaging all our senses in His service. The beginning of service is to engage our hearing organs, and receive the transcendental message by aural reception. And whenever we are mature in receiving the transcendental message from books like Bhagavad-gita, and Srimad-Bhagavatam, via media the transparent bona fide Spiritual Master, then we are able to chant or engage our tongue in the service of the Lord, being engaged in the service of the Lord. The material covering of our senses becomes inactive and actual spiritual form of activity becomes manifest. I very much appreciate your development of this spiritual perception, and Krishna has given you a good chance in the matter of your proposed dealings with the U.N. Please immediately finish the job by incorporating our association in the U.N. It is a very good opportunity. Consult Brahmananda and do it immediately. In the future, we will have very great scope for introducing our Krishna Consciousness for leaders amongst all the nations. I think it is a very great opportunity for us, and we should utilize it.

So far your going to Buffalo, Brahmananda will see to it, and if it is already changed I have no objection. We have to serve Krishna from any circumstance or position. That shall be our mode of life. It doesn't matter where we live or where we serve.

If possible, secure one copy of "Illustrated Weekly of the Times of India", Bombay, and you will find a nice article about ourselves on page 38. I think you can get this paper from any magazine store. It was published on January 21, 1968.

I have no overwork; I am not working materially. Thanking you once more for your kind letter. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
