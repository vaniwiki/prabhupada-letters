My dear Adi Kesava Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 29th, 1977.

I am very pleased to know that one Russian boy, Vladimir, has very sincerely taken to Krsna consciousness. Because it is very difficult of practice Krsna consciousness in Russia, we can be a little lenient in his case. I am very glad to accept him as my initiated disciple. His new spiritual name is Valmiki Muni Das. You can perform a fire ceremony for his initiation. Let him promise to chant at least 16 rounds daily, but don't ask him to change anything else abruptly. Never mind if there is some difficulty with his wife. There is no need that he should leave her. For now let him simply promise to chant his rounds, and gradually the other principles will follow.

I hope this finds you well.

Your every well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
