My dear Puru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 7, 1976 addressed to Hrdayananda Maharaja. Concerning the use of sour cream in the temple, it should be stopped immediately. Nothing should be offered to the Deities which is purchased in the stores. Things produced by the karmis should not be offered to Radha-Krishna. Ice cream, if you can prepare, is o.k., but not otherwise. Now, you have such a big stock of this sour cream, so sell the stock at any cost. Who is the rascal who has purchased without permission?

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
