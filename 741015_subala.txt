My dear Subaladas Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 20, 1974 and I was very glad to read the contents. I thank you for following the order of your spiritual master. This is the motto of our spiritual life: __yasya prasadad bhagavata prasadao.__ My other godbrothers they are concerned with litigations, politics, and diplomacy, so what is the __pracara__? As far as I am concerned I have the blessings of my guru maharaj. I do not need anything else. That is how I went to your country, just to try to carry out his order. By his blessings it has come out successful.

So work diligently. It is a good place. Take more devotees from Australia, and organize it nicely. You have got a good field. You are an old, experienced worker, and I have full confidence in you. Krishna will bless you in this attempt. There I have seen the Indian people are very receptive.

Next time I return to USA by that way this coming April I may go to Fiji, so please arrange.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
