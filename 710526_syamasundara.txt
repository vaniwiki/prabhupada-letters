Bombay

My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. You will be glad to know that I am starting for Bombay on the morning of the 31st May, 1971, at 9:00 P.M. on Indian Airlines, flight no. 130. So please attend the airport and pick me up. A telegram will follow.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
