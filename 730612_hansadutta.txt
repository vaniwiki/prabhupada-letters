My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 2, 1973 and I have noted the contents carefully.

I have not yet received any copies of the Swedish booklet. I am very, very pleased that you are continuously holding festivals.

Concerning the introduction to __Bhagavad-gita,__ why not just translate the introduction from the English __Bhagavad-gita__? What is the difference? You may also add the names of these prominent German men that you have mentioned, that they have also appreciated this __Bhagavad-gita.__ This may be added as a note at the end of the introduction. This German __Bhagavad gita__ is a very important achievement and the credit goes to you for your dedicated efforts. Thank you very much.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
