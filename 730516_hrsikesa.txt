My dear Hrsikesa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 8 1973. You are welcome to join us at any moment provided you do so in your original status. You have to immediately leave India for working outside.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
