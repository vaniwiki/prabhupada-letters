My dear Madhava devi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 1974. Yes there is no objection to your casting clay forms of Deities into plaster. I understand you are a nice artist in this medium, so make Deities of Gaura-Nitai and send me photographs of the forms. We can discuss this further when I come to Paris.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
