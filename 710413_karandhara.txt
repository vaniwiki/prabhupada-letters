My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 30th March, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Now I understand "breakdown." I Thought it meant that the system had broken down. Therefore I was a little perturbed. Now I understand it is different breakdown. So as I am not very expert in understanding, you will kindly explain to me when there is technical words.

I have been invited by Australia and I am seriously considering visiting Moscow on my way to Europe, so my reaching at L.A. may take some more time, but I am always remembering about L.A. because I was very peacefully doing my translating work there. Since I left L.A. my translating work is stopped somehow or other.

Regarding $20,000 advanced to BTG account, you have asked seeking my instruction where to forward $5000 monthly check. You may deposit in my checking account, no. 03081-61625, Pico-La Cienega branch of Bank of America.

So far as Gayatri initiations are concerned, the tape is not required. You have the threads, chanted on by me and now I am enclosing herewith copies of Gayatri mantra, one for each of the seven disciples to be initiated. Hold a fire ceremony. Chant Gayatri mantra to them individually and let them hear and repeat. Then offer the threads on my behalf. The fire sacrifice should be performed as usual.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Saci Devi as well as the other boys and girls there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
