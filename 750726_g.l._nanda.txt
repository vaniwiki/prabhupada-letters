Dear Sriman Nandaji, 

Please accept my greetings. Since I last wrote you my letter dated June 14, 1975, I have received one encouraging letter from Dr. Channa Reddy, Governor of Uttar Pradesh. He is very enthusiastic in this project. So I am very anxiously awaiting your reply to my letter. If you have not as yet replied, do it now and kindly address it to New Vrindaban, R.D. 1, Box 620, McCreary's Ridge, Moundsville, West Virginia 26041 USA.

I am herewith enclosing a copy of the Governor's letter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
