Calcutta

My dear Tamala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I hope everything is going on with you all well in Calcutta, I was expecting your letter at any moment, but I have not received any word from you since you went there. This morning I have sent you one telegram requesting you to send me a complete report immediately.

In the meantime, our plans have been changed so that I will come to Calcutta from Bombay by plane and not by train. Our whole party is leaving Surat on the 4th January and we shall reach Bombay on the morning of the 4th. From Bombay I shall fly to Calcutta by Indian Airlines flight number IC-175 leaving on the 5th January at 6.15 PM, reaching Calcutta the same evening at 8.20 PM.

Two of us will be arriving there, so please meet us at the airport.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
