My dear Nitai,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your unsigned letter dated January 1, 1976.

Regarding the translators, I like the work of Nrsimha Vallabha Goswami best, and I want to settle up with him. I have already written Visvambhara in this regard. Sri Tripathi is after money, so we do not want him. Dr. Premlata Paliwal's translation is not bad. Later on we can decide on her. So far Dr. Radharamana Gupta is concerned, first let us have a Gurukula, then we shall see who will be the headmaster. We will consider about him later, but his translation was not very good.

Now beginning from this year's Mayapur festival the devotees will begin preparing for Bhakti-sastri examination. Therefore we require a guidebook for Deity worship, arcana-paddhati, based on Hari-bhakti-Vilasa. All brahmanas will be responsible to learn this book. I would like to have the manuscript ready as soon as possible, preferably my Gaura Purnima. So please work diligently for this. Pradyumna began this, but I do not know what he has done with his work.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
