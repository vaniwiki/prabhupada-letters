[It is an extract from a 1949 letter of Srila Prabhupada. The original letter was in Bengali, and was reprinted, along with this translation, in the summer 2001 edition of Rays of the Harmonist, a magazine published by followers of HH Narayana Maharaja. ---Bhakti Vikās Swami]

__Śrī Gauḍīya Patrikā__\\
By the revered Śrīyuta Abhaya Caraṇa De\\
Editor of __Back to Godhead__ magazine

Pūjyapāda Keśava Mahārāja,\\
Please accept my __daṇḍavat praṇāma.__

Yesterday I became extremely pleased to receive __Śrī Gauḍīya Patrikā,__ which you sent me. Although the __Patrikā__ is of medium size, its presentation is very beautiful and its paper and printing is also good. Very few printing mistakes are seen, and can be considered negligible or almost nil. By this it seems that the supervision of the magazine is very well done. Your comprehensive and extensive preaching efforts always attract my heart.

That you always remember me indicates the greatness of character for which you were celebrated even in your previous __āśrama__ before joining the __maṭha.__ But I am so unfortunate that I am unable to render any service to you. Therefore, please forgive my offences and discrepancies out of your magnanimous nature. You amply encouraged me at the time of the first printing of my __Back to Godhead__ magazine. Though engaged in so many activities, you blessed my poor home by placing your foot dust in it.

You inspired us to remember Śrīpāda Narahari Dā* in the very first article of your __Śrī Gauḍīya Patrikā.__ We became grateful to you for this in every respect. The affectionate and sweet behavior of Śripāda Narahari Dā will remain illuminated in my heart forever. The pangs of separation from him are in no way less than the pangs of separation from Śrīla Prabhupāda.

The articles in __Śrī Gauḍīya Patrikā__ are placed in proper order. You have done excellent work by starting with an article on Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa. Publishing life-sketches of our previous __ācāyas,__ one by one, in the __Patrikā__ will be extremely beneficial for our __sampradāya.__

I saw a proposal that your __Patrikā__ will also present articles in other languages besides Bengali. By the order of Śrīla Prabhupāda, I started __Back to Godhead__ magazine to put forward discussions in the English language.

When you will print articles in your __Patrikā__ in English, please bless me by accepting a little service from me. I have written many articles and essays in English, and I can send them at your convenience.

(Translated from __Śrī Gauḍīya Patrikā__ 1.2)

*Narahari Dā is the affectionate address for Śrīla Narahari Sevāvigraha Prabhu. In Bengali, __Dā__ means “elder brother.”
