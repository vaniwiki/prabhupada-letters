My dear Gurukrpa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I may inform you that we have received the permission for constructing our Juhu temple. I want that your collection should be sent there so that the buildings may be completed as soon as possible.

I am instructing Ramesvara to do the needful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
