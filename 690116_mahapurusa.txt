====== Letter to: Mahapurusa ======

My dear Mahapurusa,

Please accept my blessings. I was very glad to receive your letter of January 11, 1969.

I have received good report that you are selling __Back To Godhead__ very nicely, and similarly you should try to sell our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ and always request people to chant Hare Krishna. This will increase your advancement in Krishna Consciousness. So I am very much pleased with your activities there. Everyone of you should always be engaged in your respective duties depending upon Krishna, and things will come automatically very nice. Thanking you again for your encouraging letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
