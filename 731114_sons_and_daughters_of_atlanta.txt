My dear Sons and Daughters of Atlanta:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 23, 1973 with the silk chaddar. It is very nice, and just suitable for me. Here it is getting a little cold, being the winter season, so I am wearing it. So I thank you all for giving me this gift, and I pray for your ever advancement in Krsna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
