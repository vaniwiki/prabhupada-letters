My dear Kapurji,

Thank you very much for your letter dated April 9th, 1976. I am very sorry I could not go personally because the Ramnavami function is going on, and there was other function in Mathura yesterday; it was very successful meeting. Tomorrow I am going to Bombay, and then Australia. I will be in Bombay up to the 17th, at Hare Krishna Land, Juhu Road, Juhu, Bombay 400 054.

I can understand from your letters that you want to retire from business. It is very good proposal, but instead of devoting yourself to solitude, why not come with me and travel in foreign countries for some time? This will help you to obtain direct experience of our activities, and maybe you can become a preacher like me.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
