My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 14, 1972, and I am very, very happy to hear from you that you have started one new ISKCON center at Brisbane, Australia. I do not know if Madhudvisa has made any arrangement for me to come there, I have not heard from him in that connection, but he has invited me to come there, so if I get the opportunity I shall be glad to visit you at Brisbane as well. As for your taking sannyas, that we shall see when I shall come there. For the time being do not disturb yourself or your wife in this matter, there is sufficient time.

As for your opening still another center, if you are only few men there it will be better to stick there for some time and develop everything first. If we open so many centers and then later there is difficulty to maintain them because insufficient men, or if we have to close them, then what is the use. We are not after so many centers, but we want to make devotees, pure devotees of Krishna, that is all. Better one temple with sufficient strong men than many temples with few strong men. Do not open temples simply for the sake of adding some numbers. Let us see the success of one temple, then we shall discuss opening other center.

You have named your child Bhakta Saumya Abhay Charan Dasa, so that's all right. But if you leave your wife with such new-born child, to open other center or take sannyas, what will be the result or benefit of mother alone with child? There must be some proper arrangement, that is not our policy to get married an go away without any responsibility for these things. Husband-wife means he must accept responsibility for her his life-long, it is not such light matter we can reject and do as we like, no. Better I think you stick there for some time more, live peacefully husband and wife, and develop the temple to your full capacity. Later on we shall see to other things.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
