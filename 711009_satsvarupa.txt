My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 1st and 4th October, 1971, respectively and have noted the contents. I am very glad to know that you are trying your best to organize a school in Dallas and purchase a building in this connection, and that you are very much anxious to get a $15,000 loan from me. So I have advised Karandhara to give you this sum as a loan for six months because this money is kept to meet emergency demand from Dai Nippon. We have to keep our credit nicely with Dai Nippon. Twice I paid $20,000 each time. so they are convinced that we are a solid party. So this $15,000 loan to your school scheme may be returned as soon as possible, not later than six months. So you can immediately complete negotiation and take the money from Karandhara.

Regarding your teacher problem, I have advised Pradyumna to go there and teach students primary Sanskrit lessons at least to learn the alphabet, so that in the future when they go to India they may learn Sanskrit very easily. The students should be taught Sanskrit both in Devanagari and Bengali alphabets. Satyabhama in New Vrindaban has written a nice book for elementary lessons in English. I think this book may be printed immediately. If not the manuscript may be used to teach the students. The important matter is that the children are taken care of nicely. Bhavananda was talking with me that in New Vrindaban students were very much neglected. Therefore they were immediately transferred to New York. Every parent wants to see that their children are taken care of very nicely. That is the first duty. If they are not healthy then how they can prosecute their education? If they are undernourished it is not good for their future activities. They must have sufficient quantity of milk and then dhal, capatis, vegetables, and a little fruit will keep them always fit. There is no need of luxurious fatty foods but milk is essential. A big building is also very good for the children's health. They can move freely and run and jump.

Yes, Visnujana Maharaja is personally a nice devotee so he has created nice devotees. __Apani achari prabhu jivare sikhaya,__ which means that Lord Caitanya used to behave personally and then he used to teach others. So every one of us should follow this principle of Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Please offer my blessings to Mohanananda Prabhu and the others. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
