My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 19, 1969, and I have noted the contents with care. Regarding the work you have done on __Caitanya Caritamrta,__ when they are finished being edited and typed please send me the copies so I will give you further work to do with this. I have written in Govinda Dasi's letter about this which you will please read.

Concerning Vamanadeva's trouble with the draft, I think that if properly utilized, my certificate of acceptance of a person as student of __Bhagavad-gita__ and __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ may be very helpful in avoiding the draft because recently one Lieutenant Colonel, Mr. Davis, from the Selective Service came to see me about our activities, and he is fairly impressed. So I think that if Vamanadeva presents himself as a serious student of this institution he may not be called. I have a very nicely made certificate which can be sent to Vamanadeva if he would like to try for this. Regarding Muralidhara, he is now working here, and he is helping to meet the huge expenditures of the Los Angeles temple. But I shall see if he cannot be spared after a few weeks. Let me see how he is doing here. If he is not very much needed, which I shall know after a few weeks, then I shall ask him to join you in Hawaii.

Please continue to keep me informed of your activities in Hawaii. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
