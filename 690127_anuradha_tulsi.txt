My dear Anuradha Dasi and Tulsi Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of both your letters dated January 25, 1969 and January 21, 1969 respectively, and I have carefully noted the contents in each. You have both expressed a sincere desire to leave San Francisco immediately and come to Los Angeles where you can share an apartment for both of you and your children. This idea seems to be a good solution to both of your problems, and as soon as you are able you may do it. If neither of you are very peaceful staying in San Francisco then it is not very good for Krishna Consciousness, and I think the conditions will be improved if you come to Los Angeles. So as you are able, I shall look forward to seeing you again with your children in Los Angeles.

I hope this will meet you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: I have placed the peacock feather which was sent by Anuradha upon Lord Jagannatha in my altar room, and He is looking very beautiful with it.
