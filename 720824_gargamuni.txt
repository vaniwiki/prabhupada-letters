Vrndavana

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter from Vrndavana dated 15th July 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. You may know that I am no longer in London but I am in Los Angeles and New Vrndavana for the month of September. I am going back to India by the 15th of October. So you have stayed so long in India, if you can remain there one and one half months more kindly remain there and wait for me. When I come there you will stay with me. Meanwhile if it is possible you try to work in conjunction with Gurudasa on the Vrndavana Project because I think you have got real interest to see that it is completed very nicely. If however you are unable to work with Gurudasa, otherwise you sit down and wait for me there. Do not fight with anyone, try to remain always very humble and meek like the advanced Vaisnava devotee, always thinking yourself lower than the straw in the street and more tolerant than the tree, and in this way very quickly you will be come relieved of so many anxieties. When we shall meet in October, then we shall chalk out some plan further.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
