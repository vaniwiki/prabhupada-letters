My dear Indira,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 14, 1969, along with the very nice pictures you have sent to me. I thank you very much for this and I am always very pleased with your sincere efforts to serve Krishna.

For the __Krishna__ book we will require paintings, so we will not need any etching and woodcut. So you can send me some samples of your paintings and then I'll give you some suggestions. But anyway, you continue to improve your very good artistic talents and it will soon come to the perfectional stage. Regarding your question about artist materials, you may use any materials which will be useful in producing nice paintings.

I hope this will meet you in very good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
