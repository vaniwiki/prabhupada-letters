My dear Baradraj,

Please accept my blessings.

Just recently I have received one letter from His Holiness Guru Kripa from Japan. The Panca Tattva Deities in Hawaii are now many years old and they are beyond being repaired. Please therefore immediately make new Deities of the same size as the ones that are now installed. They should be made in the same process as you are now doing for Fiji. This should be done as soon as possible as Guru Kripa Maharaj says that all the plaster is falling off of the Deities.

I shall be glad to see finished photos of the Fiji Deities. Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
