My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 8, 1972, and thank you for your kind sentiments. Yes, I always think of you too. You are one of my first disciples, along with your wife, Janaki, so I am always praying to Krishna to give you His all blessings for bringing you back to Home, back to Godhead. Wherever you may be, it doesn't matter, but don't give up the principles of spiritual life, that is my request. You have become my disciple so I must request you to chant 16 rounds and follow the regulative practices of devotional service, and you may know it for sure that very quickly you will achieve the supreme perfectional stage of your life.

Now we are in Vrindaban, and the programme for speaking daily morning and evening in the courtyard samadhi-place at Radha-Damodara temple is very much being appreciated by the devotees. Next we shall go to Hyderabad for some weeks. You have mentioned nothing of your wife, so what is her position?

Hoping this meets you both in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
