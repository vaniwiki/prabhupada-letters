My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated 13rd and 20th January, 1976 respectively, and I have noted the contents.

You say my apartment will be ready by mid-March but without an elevator, how can I use it? Here in Mayapur we have begun construction on a 67 room Residential Quarters along the Northern boundary of the land to be ready for use by Gaura Purnima. I have asked Tamala Krishna to send his Radha Damodara party's collections to pay for it. Caitya-guru is engaged to help oversee the construction.

I have already sent by separate post the authorization for the Rs. 22,143/49p to be transferred to the B. of Hyderabad a/c.

Regarding the Government trying to acquire our land, I have already told you to finish the Temple immediately. So far paying for Bombay construction, what is the wrong if I issue cheques as per your advice? Bank of America should send credit advices whenever they receive funds. You make a photocopy of the advice and against it I will send cheques. ECC only has to paid after 30 days, so what is the hurry?

Haridasa told me he was going to Bombay. If he can't be trusted then let him work in Bombay under supervision.

You say you have enclosed copies of the land deeds from Nellore, but I did not receive them.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
