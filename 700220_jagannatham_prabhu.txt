My dear Jagannatham Prabhu,

Please accept my humble obeisances. I am so glad to receive your letter dated 10 February, 1970, redirected from my New York center. Perhaps you are the eldest amongst us now living as disciples of Srila Prabhupada. You are now eighty-one years old, and I am only seventy-four. Therefore I am your younger brother and I shall always expect blessings from you.

So far your son is concerned, last year when I was in Los Angeles I invited your son to come and see me; and if he comes to me, surely I shall try my best to bring him into our line of devotional service. I am sure if he sees me it will not be difficult to convince him about this Krsna Consciousness philosophy because after all he is your son. I do not know his present address, otherwise I would have called him here directly. But if you ask him immediately to see me, it will be very nice. He can live with me in my personal apartment or in the Temple for as many days as he likes. There will be no difficulty. Surely he will be very much influenced by seeing our Temple activities and street Sankirtana movement in the city. So please ask him to see me immediately.

So far our publication is concerned, I give you below the names of the books and magazines with their prices and weights for calculating postal charges.
