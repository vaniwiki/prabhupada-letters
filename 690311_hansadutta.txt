My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of Feb. 28, 1969, and I am very much surprised that other nonsense magazines are being published by Dayala Nitai, and Janardana says it is in my knowledge! I am very much surprised to hear this. Enclosed I am forwarding one letter to Dayala Nitai, and how it is that without your knowledge these things are being done? Certainly it must be disturbing to you---it is disturbing to me also!

Please do work on the French BTG, and you must immediately ask Dayala Nitai to stop that printing business. I was doubtful about him because he was still inclined to that yoga process, and my doubts are now coming to be true. He does not understand our philosophy very nicely.

I have come here last Monday, the 3rd March. The place is very nice, with both sunshine and seaview and fresh air. But the boy Kartikeya has fallen sick and it is apprehended that he is developing appendicitis trouble.

I shall soon return to the mainland and I plan to go to New York the first week of April. Please inform me further of this printing situation on receipt of this letter, and what is being done to remedy the situation. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
