My dear Jagadisa Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 9, 1973 of the GBC report for Canadian Zone and I thank you very much for it. I am glad that the book distribution is going on there consistently.

Regarding the management of the Ottawa and Regina centers try to train them. We have to train sometimes. Whenever there is something extraordinarily wrong, you can remain there for sometime. You should rectify, but not reject. Members are coming to join us to be rectified, not to be rejected. So, try to rectify the incorrigible, and if not possible, then change. What can we do?

It is nice that Subaladas Maharaja is travelling. As sannyasi, he should travel. The more a sannyasi travels and preaches, the more he becomes experienced and unattached.

Regarding your recommendation, I am accepting the following devotee as my initiated disciple.

Bhaktavasya Dasi---Geraldine Luczyk.\\
Yes, I authorize that you may chant on the beads of the newly initiated disciples.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
