====== Letter to: Nityananda ======

New Orleans

My dear Nityananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 16th and I have noted the contents carefully. I can see from your account that everything is being conducted in a first class fashion and if you continue to spread Lord Caitanya's movement in this way your life will also become glorious. Therefore I recommend that you go on with more enthusiasm to inspire the devotees of New Orleans Yatra and I am confident that through your sincerity you can very shortly be one of the top distributing centres in the world.

The initiation that you have recommended are approved by me. Victor Mistretta is now to be called Vrikodara and Darrel Martin is now Dvibhuja. You may send one letter to Kirtanananda Swami along with their beads for chanting on. I have authorized him to chant on the beads on my behalf. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
