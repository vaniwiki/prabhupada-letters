Dear sir:

Re: Time fixed deposits for 257,356.09 dollars and 110,000.00 dollars respectively, due to be matured by the first week of March with interest.

With reference to the above, I beg to inform you that on maturity of the above time fixed deposit, you can transfer the whole amount to your Bombay branch, account number 16026, in favor of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Mayapur vrindavan Fund).

Thanking you in anticipation.

Faithfully yours,\\
