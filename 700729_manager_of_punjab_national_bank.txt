Dear Sir:

Re: My Savings Fund Account No. 2595 with you

I beg to inform you that this day, 29th July, 1970, I have remitted 16039.18 U.S. Dollars through Security Pacific National Bank, Culver City Branch, under receipt No. 729949 for credit of my account SS/F No. 2595 with you.

This amount is for the purpose of constructing a Radha Krsna Temple at Mayapur, as it is contributed by my American disciples.

Please acknowledge receipt, and on hearing from you I shall begin construction work.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
