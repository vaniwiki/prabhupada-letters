====== Letter to: Sudama ======

Los Angeles

My dear Sudama:

Please accept my blessings and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 12th March 1973 and I carefully examined the contents.

Radio and T.V. programs are alright if we can introduce our literature, like __Bhagavad-gita,__ etc., otherwise there is so much nonsense on the media that they will forget quickly what they see and hear.

I am glad to hear that our Krsna das Prabhu is back in our company. He is a good boy, but since he has been married there has been difficulty. So now he is returning with his wife and child and he must be given all encouragement.

You mentioned about your Temple bus, and that is very nice. When I saw Rupanuga's bus in New Vrndavana I wanted that there be a whole fleet. But you should not take Radha-Krsna travelling, better you take Gaura-Nitai. For serving Gaura-Nitai there is no offense, but if Radha-Krsna is there and there is some discrepancy, then there is great offense and this should be avoided. Therefore, I gave the same advice to Visnujana when I was in Pittsburgh.

The idea of the Temple bus is to attract them aboard back to Krsna and the hippies and college students, anyone, will be very much attracted to the program. Now you have my full blessings, so go out and recruit some solid new devotees to help us push on this movement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
