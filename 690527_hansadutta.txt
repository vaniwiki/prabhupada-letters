My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 22, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I have initiated the boy whom you have recommended named Steve* and his beads are sent herewith. Please help him to understand the principles of Krishna Consciousness as far as possible. Regarding Candanacarya's marriage with Sadanandini, if they settle up amongst themselves, I shall be glad. They are a very nice combination. You have written that you are wishing to leave for Toronto with Kanupriya, but this can be done only if there is no sacrifice of the Montreal temple. You are doing so nicely there as you have written, so why should you leave? Very soon we shall be getting huge quantities of __Back To Godhead,__ and I want that Montreal temple shall purchase at least $100's worth of copies for selling each month. Do you think that in Toronto you will be able to raise as much money as you are doing now in Montreal? Please think over these matters and let me know what you have decided. Anyway, I am pleased that you are very enthusiastic for spreading this sublime movement, and your idea of having devotees going to the Newport Festival is very nice. You may correspond with the other centers on this point. Another thing is I have heard nothing from Bharadraja and Rukmini. I am anxious to hear from them and to see how they are doing the pictures. I have so many pictures for them to do, but why they are not corresponding?

Please convey my blessings to Himavati and all others. I hope this will meet you all in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
