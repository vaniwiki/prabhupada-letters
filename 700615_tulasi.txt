My dear Tulasi dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated by Post 12th June, 1970, and it is so much encouraging.

May Krsna bless you on and on in your progressive march for advancing Krsna Consciousness. Personally I cannot give you anything, but I can sincerely pray to Krsna for your improvement on and on.

I was so pleased to read your letter that I have taken some xerox copies and sent them to some centers putting before them an example.

So offer my blessings to the boys: Bhaskara das, Vanamali das, Rsabhadeva das and Ezekiel, and go on with your work thinking always of Krsna by chanting His Holy Name. And keep me informed about your future progress.

Hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
