My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. In your last letter you asked how to celebrate Krishna's and Radha's birthday. As last year, on K's with fasting up to midnight, and R's fasting up to noon. Then feasting. Certainly those who take Krishna's advent as that of an ordinary man are great fools, but if one can simply understand the transcendental nature of this event as well as His disappearance, he becomes immediately liberated.

So long as Hansadutta and Himavati remain in N.Y. please see that they are well taken care of. There seems to be some difficulty.

I am a little disturbed to learn about your financial position as serious. I think you don't have to pay anything to Boston, as every center should be independent, especially when Satsvarupa and Rayarama are there. If printing BTG is too expensive, then revert to mimeograph. Unless positive gain, we should not take risk about BTG. You will be glad to know that for the last two days I am taking part in the cooking; so this is positive proof of improvement in my health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
