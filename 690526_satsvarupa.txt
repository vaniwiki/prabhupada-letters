My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 17, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I also have received the watch, and it appears to be working properly. Regarding your idea of purchasing a house, if it is possible, do it immediately. When you pay big rent anyway, purchasing a house is nice. Now Murari and his good wife, Lilavati, are there, so this will be a great boon to your Sankirtana activities.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have received your check for $100.00. Please let me know if you have received your money from Columbus?
