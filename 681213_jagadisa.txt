My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find your prayer beads which I have chanted one round upon and initiated you with. Your spiritual name is Jagadisa das Brahmacari. Jagadisa means Lord Jagannatha, the Lord of the Universe.

So please continue to be very sincere about developing your Krishna Consciousness and Krishna will give you all facilities to return with Him to His Spiritual Abode. Take instructions from your god-brother Rupanuga, chant your sixteen rounds daily, follow all regulations strictly, and you will have all blessings from the disciplic succession to advance nicely. So now you have this all important opportunity so I request you to take full advantage and perfect yourself in Krishna Consciousness. This is my request to all of you. This will be great service not only to yourself, but also to all the living entities with whom we come into contact.

Please convey my blessings to all others. I hope that you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have not heard anything from Rupanuga since a long time.
