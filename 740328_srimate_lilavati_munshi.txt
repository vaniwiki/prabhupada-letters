Dear Srimate Lilavati Munshi:

Please accept my greetings. In continuation from my last letter to you, I wish to inform you that I have now arrived in Bombay a week ago. I would like to meet with you; therefore, please let me know where and when I may see you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
