My dear Jayapataka Bhavananda, and Brahmananda Maharajas,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your express letter which arrived in Vrindaban March 19th, and I have noted the contents.

Of course I do not know what is the actual expenditure, but I request you to finish the business as far as possible and the money will be supplied. But this time when I go I want to see that everything under construction is completed. Brahmananda Swami has already gone there to help you in this connection so kindly do the needful. Combine together and get the things completely done.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
