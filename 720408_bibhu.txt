My dear Bibhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 10, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I am so glad to know that your temple is growing and you are expanding your programs. If we simply remain very sincere, then Krishna will give us all facility for serving Him nicely. This college program is very good, and you should continue in this way, giving all these student an opportunity to learn this Krishna consciousness philosophy and culture. They are all seeking after some knowledge, but they are being misguided by their blind leaders. It is our duty to give them real knowledge and understanding of the purpose of life.

Please offer my blessings to all the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
