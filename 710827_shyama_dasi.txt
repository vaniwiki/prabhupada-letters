My Dear Shama Dasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 20th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. When I received the letter the envelope had been opened and then stapled closed and some portion of the letter was missing; it came in two parts. I don't know what happened or what part of your letter is missing.

Anyway, please be happy with the newly installed Deities there in New Vrindavan and take very greatest of care for them. Dress them nicely, clothe them nicely with garlands and offer very nice foodstuffs. And be happy with your son Samba and good husband and engage him fully in editing work. His work has suffered so much; I don't know why Hayagriva has become so slack. Anyways please encourage him. I haven't heard from him in some time. Where is he?

So now Their Lordships have arrived there in New Vrindaban. So you should see to it that New Vrindaban is developed so nicely and meets up to its name. Satya bhama and Paramananda and Ranadhir and others are there and your son is also growing strong. So please build up New Vrindaban very nicely. And I am soon coming there so don't be worried.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
