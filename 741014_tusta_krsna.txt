Dear Tusta Krishna Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 15, 1974 from Indonesia and have noted the contents. So for your preaching you should just request everyone you meet to chant Hare Krishna and to follow the four regulative principles. This will be your preaching principle wherever you go. On this basis travel and work, and Krishna will bless you.

I have come here to Mayapur and my health has improved much but still I am suffering from high blood pressure. After all, it is old age. As far as possible Krishna will keep me to work, and when He desires I will go. So I wish all my disciples to push on this movement for the rehabilitation of suffering humanity.

I see on the Indonesian stamps all Indian names: Hari Dharma, Laksmana, Sudarso. I do not know how they have become Mohammedan. They will take to Krishna consciousness, chanting of Hare Krishna because they already know Hari Dharma. When I was in Jakarta, several government officers came to see me, and they appreciated very much and were interested in Bhagavad-gita.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
