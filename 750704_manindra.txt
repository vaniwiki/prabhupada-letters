My dear Manindra devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 3, 1975 and I thank you very much for your nice sentiments. It is simply by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu that we have now got a feeling for service to Krishna. Krishna is so perfect that He comes and teaches us personally how to become Krishna conscious. What Lord Caitanya is giving no one else has done. So you continue on in this way following our rules and regulations, and I shall pray to Krishna for your ever advancement in Krishna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
