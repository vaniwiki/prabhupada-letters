My dear Syama dasi

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your kind letter dated August 27, 1968, and I am glad to hear about successful Sankirtana party's activities in Los Angeles. You will be glad to know that very soon I am going to San Francisco, maybe by the end of the first week of September.

The nice sentiments expressed in your letter under reply is very much pleasing to me. When I initiated you, I accepted you on that very moment as my daughter. So you are eternally my daughter and I am your father. There is no doubt about it. And our relationship is based on Krishna Consciousness, so the more successful you preach and help Krishna Consciousness movement, the more our relationship in transcendental platform is firm and fixed up. Our business is to chant and glorify the Holy Name of Krishna and wherever we may remain, Krishna is with us, Krishna is within your heart, Krishna is within my heart. So, spiritually there is no question of separation, even physically we may be in far distant place. So I am very glad that you are taking more and more interest in this movement, and I pray to Krishna that you be fixed up in that position, eternally.

Thank you very much for your letter, hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
