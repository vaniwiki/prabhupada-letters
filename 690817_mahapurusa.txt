My dear Mahapurusa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter of August 14th, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased to learn that you are now chanting 16 rounds daily, eating Bhagavat Prasadam, reading __Bhagavad-gita,__ and going on Sankirtana Party. All of these things will save you, as they will save anyone who persists in Krishna Consciousness faithfully and sincerely. Actually, the presence of Maya should not surprise us because this is the Kingdom of Maya. All of the uncountable living entities in the uncountable universes are generally to be found under the stringent grip of Maya's power. So the presence of Maya is not a very wonderful thing. But what is wonderful is when a sincere soul decides to turn away from the attraction of Maya and decides to serve Krishna in pure unalloyed devotional service. So this is what we should fix our attention to: serving Krishna sincerely. Then automatically the influence of Maya will become nil and we can remember our eternal loving relationship with the Supreme Lord. But as long as we are attracted by the nonsense glittering of Maya's call, this pure state of consciousness cannot be realized within the heart. So continue assisting Upendra as you are doing it now, and I am sure Krishna will help you in all respects.

Regarding the $1,000, you don't require it now. You just try to improve the Seattle temple conjointly with Upendra. I was very glad to learn from Upendra's letter that you have lectured nicely, and improve this preaching habit. Kirtana means whatever we hear from the Spiritual Master we repeat it again nicely. One who can reproduce the sound vibration heard from the Spiritual Master, he will be a good preacher. I hope you will keep me informed of your further progress, and I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
