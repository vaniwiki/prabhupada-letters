My dear Madhudvisa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter to Brahmananda Swami dated October 9, 1975. They promised before me to follow the principles. If they are not, then they are not allowed to initiate, but if they are actually following, then they are allowed. These things should be raised in our next meeting in Mayapur and decided.

My point is that even if somebody does not go in one line with the rest of the godbrothers, he can remain separately, but it does not mean that he may disobey the principles that I have laid down. So long as one follows the principles, he continues to be my disciple.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
