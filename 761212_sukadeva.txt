My dear Sukadev,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 26, 1976.

So, Gurukrpa says one thing and you say something else. What can I say? Now you should consult with Ramesvara and Hrdayananda Maharajas about your engagement. Work under their direction. That will be alright.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
