My dear Guru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. I will be leaving Honolulu on Feb. 9th and will be arriving there in Los Angeles on the same day. While I am in L.A., we can discuss your plans in full detail.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
