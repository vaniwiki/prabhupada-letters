My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of May 29th and I have examined the contents.

You have written to recommend Tripurari for sannyasi. Tripurari is however already a brahmacari so in essence there is no difference between brahmacari. I have asked Tripurari to dedicate his life to distributing my books and he has turned out the most expert of all our sellers. It is certainly miraculous how he is distributing so many big books even to people who are not interested in Vedic literature. If he takes sannyasa he may not be able to constantly assume so many disguise in public and employ so many tricks for selling books to persons, as it is not in accord with some of the etiquette for sannyasa. Also, I have decided for the time being not to award sannyasa order. Your write the this recommendation is your own idea and that he himself is perfectly happy heading up a traveling party of book distributers. So let him go on as he is doing; Krsna is giving him all facility and without question he is doing more __than any sannyasi__ by his personally distributing hundreds of books day after day and inspiring others to follow.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
