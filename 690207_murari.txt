My dear Murari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 30, 1969, and I am always very pleased when I hear from you. You have mentioned in your letter that you have been making plans to build a shrine, and when you are able to, please send these plans to me so I may see what you have in mind. I am also pleased to note that Vamanadeva and yourself are seriously taking steps to begin the project of making thrones for the deities in all of our temples. In New York, Nara Narayana is going to try again to have brass deities made from the mold made from the deities in New York. Similarly, there is the possibility of obtaining deities from India in the near future. So in either of these cases, we can expect many new pairs of deities before very long, and such thrones as you are planning to work on will be an essential addition to all of our temples.

So far as you going to New Vrindaban, I think that for the time being you should concentrate your efforts in organizing these projects you have begun in Hawaii. For the time being concentrate in Hawaii, and when you are needed in New Vrindaban, you will be called to go there.

I have just learned today that Bhurijana, a devotee in Buffalo is making arrangements to open a center in North Carolina where one other devotee's mother is letting us use her house for two months at least with no charge so we may see the possibilities of starting a center there. Similarly, there is some possibility of beginning a center in Berkeley, and Dindayal is looking into this possibility. So Krishna is giving us all facility to serve Him, and I am so pleased with the nice cooperation that my students are giving me in spreading this most important philosophy around the entire world.

Please convey my blessings to your excellent wife, Lilavati, and also to your little daughter, Subhadra. I hope this will meet all of you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
