My dear Sridhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 16/11/76.

I am very satisfied by the report of your activities. I fully approve your plan to come to India for Kumba Mela and to work mainly in India after that, visiting America every six months to see that everything is going on properly with the life membership program.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
