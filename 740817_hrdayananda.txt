My dear Hrdayananda das Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 16, 1974 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I have accepted the following students as my initiated disciples, and their spiritual names are as follows:

CARACAS:\\
Walter---Vanasancari das;\\
Miguel---Munipriya das;\\
Elba---Adhara das;\\
Thais---Tadakari das;\\
Janoski-Jayahatakosthaka das\\
SAN JUAN:\\
Magaly---Manohara dasi;\\
Americo---Adhari das;\\
Guillermo---Gopa das\\
SANTO DOMINGO:\\
Rafael---Rasakeli dasi;\\
Ramon---Rajivalicana das\\
MEXICO:\\
Orasess---Prabhudas;\\
Miguel Angel---Mantri das;\\
Fernando---Kutahanta das;\\
Georgina---Jaladhosa dasi;\\
Malena---Mathura dasi.

I am also enclosing sacred threads and sheets for Havi das, Purujit das, Urdhvabhaga das (CARACAS); and SAN JUAN; Raghupatiprana das, Vaisnavananda das, and Bhuvana Rasini das; TSKP---Kirtideva das.

So hold fire sacrifices and you may chant on the beads. Impress upon the students that they are taking vows before Radha and Krsna, the spiritual master, and the Vaisnavas. Everyone must always chant 16 rounds.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
