My Dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from you since a few weeks. I heard that you were traveling with Kirtanananda Maharaj. So now whether you have come back to your headquarters? I have also not heard from Kirtanananda Maharaj.

So I wish to know how far along things are progressing on Bhagavad Gita As It Is - revised and enlarged. Please inform me on this matter.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
