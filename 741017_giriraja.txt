Bombay

My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I have received the report of Bombay from Gargamuni Swami that things are being mismanaged. Why you are building this road without my sanction? This road will spoil the whole scheme. Why are you letting the dictation of the municipality spoil the whole thing? This road must be stopped at any cost. Fight in the court if required.

I am sending Gargamuni and Brahmananda to save the situation. They are authorized to take any action in this connection.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
