My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14th June, 1970, as well as the blueprints by Dai Nippon and pictures.

The pictures are very nicely printed. However, can the color printing be improved on the two pictures titled 1) "Returning home, Krsna and Balarama were received by Their affectionate mothers" and 2) "The joyous vibration at Krsna's birth ceremony could be heard in all the pasturing grounds and houses." If not, that is alright. There is an error in the second caption, i.e. "pastruing" should be "pasturing." There is also a correction in the Dedication, line 3, "In my boyhood ages He instructed me": this "he" should be small "h". And at the end you may add these words: (my spiritual master) __,the eternal father.__

Regarding Bhagavatam printing, I have received the blueprint copy of 1st chapter, 2nd Canto, and it is very nicely done. The style is to the standard of my previous books. So when our own press has now begun to print Srimad-Bhagavatam consecutively chapter after chapter then why should we go to Dai Nippon for their printing? Besides that, if some copies of hardbound books are required, that can be slowly done here. I think that simply for hardbound books we may not get them printed in Japan.

The first and foremost thing is regular printing of our magazines. If KRSNA book, 2nd volume, is composed and the pictures are ready, then our next printing will be KRSNA, second volume, minimum 5,000 copies, but if we get good response on the first volume, then it may be increased to 10,000 copies.

Regarding pagination of each new volume, you can begin each volume of our books with page #1, as you have decided.

The first volume of Srimad-Bhagavatam can be printed if it is composed. From second Canto they are printing chapter-wise. That is alright. So otherwise whatever is already composed KRSNA, volume 2; Bhagavad-gita AS IT IS, revised and enlarged edition; Srimad-Bhagavatam, first Canto; etc., any one of them may be printed.

In the picture of Krsna and Balarama at Their spiritual master, Sandipani Muni, it is alright that They appear with sikhas. Why Krsna should deviate from the brahmacari principles?

I have received the printed copy of __Nectar of Devotion.__ It is very nicely done. The style and the printing are 80% successful. So gradually our policy should be to make our press perfect so that we may not go outside at least for printing our books.

Now my desire is that I completely devote my time in the matter of writing and translating books, and arrangement should now be done that our Society be managed automatically. I think we should have a central governing body for dealing with important matters. I have already talked with Gargamuni about this. So if you come back by the Rathayatra festival, we can have a preliminary meeting at San Francisco in this connection.

Also, I have still not received those news clippings from Brazil.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
