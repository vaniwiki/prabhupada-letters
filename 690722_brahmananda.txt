My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 18, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased to note that under your direction Bali Mardan, Jayadvaita, Rsi Kumar, Candanacarya, Nayana Bhirama and Joel Chalson are all working very nicely. It is a good combination, so make this combination stronger and improve it. You write to say that the Printing Department has $3,000. Does this mean $3,000 including the collection from selling __TLC__? In my idea the softcover edition should be printed by realizing money from the hardcover edition in which you have already invested $6,000. That should be our business policy. I wish to know how much you have collected thus far by selling __TLC__ hardcover. That amount may be invested in printing softcover edition. Or if you think that the softcover edition will have immediate good sales, then we can invest the extra amount. I do not think that putting the advertisement on the cover as you have mentioned it will be very good. Everything should be exactly like it is, with the addition of the index. But the cover, the printing and the paper should be exactly as they are in the present edition. The price for the softcover copy should not be less than $2.95. Another thing is that if MacMillan Co. has decided to not print our __Bhagavatam,__ then this also will have to be printed by ourselves immediately.

I have received the copies you have sent of __BTG__ no. 25 and no. 26. They are nice, but I notice that in no. 26 the first article does not have any adjustment for the margins. I do not know why this is. Your idea of changing the cover border to blue is nice. Black color should not be so prominent on the cover. Blue, red and yellow should be given. You have suggested that on every back cover there will be a picture of me in __BTG,__ but I think a better proposal is that on page one or page three you may have a picture of me one month, then Guru Maharaja, then Gaura Kisora das Babaji, then Bhaktivinode Thakura, then Jagannatha das Babaji, then Lord Caitanya. This will be very nice, showing the Guru Parampara. Regarding the trip to Argentina, if it is not possible, then forget it. But do not be misled by the man who is described in your letter as "like Mr. Payne". If someone's character is doubtful, we should not associate with him and get into trouble.

Regarding opening a temple in Washington, you may consult with Tamala Krishna about this. He is planning to have a center opened in Chicago. I would prefer to have a branch opened in Washington as you have suggested, but consult with Tamala Krishna to discuss. The best idea is if both centers are opened at the same time. Regarding London's order of __BTGs,__ unless they pay then the shipment should not be sent there. Let them order and sell as they are able to do.

Regarding the Printing Department. I have already informed Advaita that Los Angeles will not be good for this purpose. Immediately we should print the softcover edition of __TLC,__ and then we shall see about opening our own press. So far as the technical machinery is concerned I think Advaita should be in charge. For selling and layout work your department will do it under your able direction. This arrangement will be nice.

I am enclosing a picture of Gaura Kisora das Babaji for printing in BTG. You may also print pictures of great acaryas in our line, such as Ramanuga Acarya and Madhvacarya. I have not yet heard any word from Germany about my going there, so this program is not fixed up at present.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
