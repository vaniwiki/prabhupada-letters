My dear Srutadeva dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the Sankirtana Newsletters Nos. 27-30, and I thank you very much for assisting me in this mission of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. These reports are very encouraging to me, and I think our men will also be encouraged to increase the book distribution. This I want.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
