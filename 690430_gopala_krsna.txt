====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 23, 1969 and was very pleased to note the contents. You are very anxious to have engagement in Krishna's service, so my immediate best service for you is to help organize the sales promotion of my books. I have already got five books; three volumes of __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ one volume __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ and one volume __Teachings of Lord Caitanya.__ This year most probably we will have another three books; namely __Nectar of Devotion,__ and two further volumes of __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ So the future hope for expansion is selling of books and magazines. So if you can make some organizational idea, you will please send it to me and I shall consider it.

I am very glad that you are thinking of marrying. Why don't you marry one Krishna Conscious girl? I think instead of going to India, you should find out some Krishna Conscious girl, either from America or Canada. We have got so many nice girls in Krishna Consciousness, and she will help you in your further advancement. You are already accustomed to the climate in this part of the world, and you have got a nice job. Therefore, I would recommend you to get married here. Lord Ramacandra once said that wife can be found in every country. DESHE DESHE KALATRATRANI. DESHE DESHE means in every country, and KALATRATRANI means wives. So all the ksatriyas married in different countries. Of course you are not expected to have many wives in different countries, but if you have one wife in one country that does not hamper. But I recommend you to marry one Krishna Conscious girl from our group. Then you will be happy.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
