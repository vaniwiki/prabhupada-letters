====== Letter to: Turya ======

Mexico City

My dear Turya dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter of December 21, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. The reports that have come from our Mexico City temple have always been encouraging and I am glad to learn that now you wish to increase your service still further. Krsna is unlimited, and His devotees' service should also be unlimited. Since you have more than five brahmanas who can participate in worshiping large Radha-Krsna deities, and you have done nicely in worshiping Jagannatha, you can order marble Radha-Krsna deities. Make the worship of Radha and Krsna most opulent, profusely decorate with flowers, celebrate all the festivals and in this way automatically large crowds of people will be attracted to your temple.

I am enclosing the Gayatri mantra sheets for Laksmi-priya Dasi and Kusa Devi Dasi as you have recommended them. Now you can perform the fire sacrifice in the assembly of devotees only and teach them to count on the fingers. They may hear in the right ear the Gayatri mantra chanted by me on tape recorder. Every one of my disciples should become so nicely trained that they may all develop the brahminical qualities.

Hoping this meets you all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
