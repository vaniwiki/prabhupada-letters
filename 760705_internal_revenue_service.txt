Dear Sir:

This is to certify that Miss Elizabeth Luise Reuther contributed the amount of U.S. $50,000 (fifty-thousand) to the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust which is a registered charity whose head office is in Bombay. This contribution was made in March, 1975, and these funds are being used for religious-charitable work.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami,

Chairman of the Board of Trustees\\
ACBS/pks
