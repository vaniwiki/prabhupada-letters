My dear Mahamsa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. If you have got a copy of Bhavan's Journal, Diwali Number, No. 8 November, 10, 1974, you can see on page 197 under the heading "Our Reader's Page," there is a question: "Should non-Hindus who have adopted the Hindu way of life e.g. the followers of the Hare Krishna movement, be allowed to enter Hindu temples?"

So immediately you reply to the Editor of Bhavan's Journal, Dr. K.M. Munshi Marg, Bombay---400 007, enclosing the letter of Swami Cinmayananda's letter about the approval of learned panditas and sannyasis about the Hare Krishna movement members entering into Hindu temples. You can mention also that we are allowed to enter into the biggest temple in India, Tirupati, as well as Nathadwar where the head of the temple received us very well and presented some gifts. Except the Jagannatha temple in Puri no where have we been checked admission.

This time we wish to go to the Jagannatha temple again, and let us see what they do. The Hindu Vishva Parishad approves us as rigid Hindus as it it will be clear from the letter of Swami Cinmayananda.

So immediately write a letter and send me a copy of your letter as well as Swami Cinmayananda's letter. We shall request them to publish the letter of Swami Cinmayananda in this connection as well.

Last night your mother came to the temple and talked with me. Sometimes you can send her some news of your health, but not very much correspondence, after all she is mother. Lord Caitanya used to also please His mother by sending prasada and men with news.

I Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
