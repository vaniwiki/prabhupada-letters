My dear Babhru dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 29, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for you daksina of 20 dollars. Please continue to follow very strictly the rules and regulations, chant 16 rounds and read my books well. This will keep you always fixed up in Krishna Consciousness and Maya will not succeed in bewildering you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
