My dear Pranava das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 28, 1974 and have noted the contents. Even if there is a slight doubt in this land purchasing matter, we shall not purchase. There must be no doubt. This man is legal-minded you say, therefore to my mind it is doubtful. It must be very cautiously examined. Mr. Maheswari must be satisfied, and he must issue a Title Certificate before the conveyance can be made. On the whole if there is a slight doubt even, do not make attempt to purchase this land. That is my request. We cannot risk the money as well purchasing some litigation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
