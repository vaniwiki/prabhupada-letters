Hawaii

My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated.

I am very glad to know that you have worked so diligently that the BBT debt has become almost nothing. It is very good that you have gone to Hawaii. It is a very good preaching field and our house there is one of the nicest in ISKCON. It simply requires very enthusiastic preaching and side by side very careful management. So I am confident that you can do both.

As you say that the mango season is fast approaching, then I will come and visit by April or May. Everyone knows that I am very fond of mangos. Actually amongst all fruits I like them most. They are considered the king of fruits. And Hawaii has very excellent mangos.

The Panca-tattva should not have long hair. It should only come to Their shoulders as you have shown in the drawing. Please correct this.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P. S. If Gurukrpa Maharaja is there please ask him to send me a report.\\
N.B. The initiation letter is coming by separate post.\\
