Vrindaban

My dear Karandhara das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your express letter dated July 6, 1974 and have noted the contents. The festival must be gorgeously done. It should not be poor. If there is a scarcity of money, it will be supplied. There must be full prasadam for all the guests. You plan for that, and I will supply the funds. Complete prasada distribution must go on.

Regarding the temple not being finished on time, that is your responsibility. What can I do?

I Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

My dear Saurabha dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25/6/74 redirected from Australia. In the meantime I have received one letter from Karandhara Prabhu, so I am replying two letters conjointly. I also request you to draw an exact similar plan like that of our Vrindaban temple and send it to Trinidad at the following address: ISKCON, 21 C Penbroke St., Port Of Spain, Trinidad, West Indies. The idea is that we have got a land there, one half acre, and we want to construct a similar temple like Vrindaban there. So I hope at your earliest convenience you will send the site plan at least to Trinidad as soon as possible. We have a proposed temple in Bhaktivedanta Manor, Letchmore Heath, London, and I hope in the meantime you might have received the same request from Madhavananda Prabhu.

I am a little agitated in mind because Karandhara's letter says that there may be some work to be done even during the time of our festival. So far prasada distribution, it must be very gorgeously done for seven days. There is no scarcity of money. I shall supply. Simply you have to manage things.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
