My dear Dhananjaya das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 15, 1974 with two bank receipts enclosed. I have noted the contents and am very pleased with the progress going on there. Things are going on. That I wanted. The classes and program must continue. That is the life of the temple. Everyone must attend the morning and evening program, otherwise it will be a dead temple.

Regarding the land purchased, I am enclosing one copy of one letter to Pranava. The land purchase should be done according to this letter. I shall advise the Bank to pay the necessary money, but the sales agreement and the conveyance deeds must be sent to me for my approval. If necessary I shall advise the bank to give a letter of credit to the Vendor, then upon completion of the conveyance, this amount shall be paid in the presence of the registrar.

You can inform Pravana that I have received his note together with 8 forms hand delivered by Daiva Shakti, but I have already sent him the first batch of forms signed and registered post. I understand from his letter that he is coming to Calcutta, and after that he will work on getting the land from Seth Hanuman Prasad Poddar, so he can discuss it with me when he comes here.

Regarding the MP Dr. Subramanian Swamy, have you taken his address?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
