My dear Nandarani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 19th, 1969, and I am so glad to learn that the activities in Los Angeles temple are going very nicely. The first day I arrived we had talks about two hours with the Beatles, but because they are materially very rich, it is little difficult for them to understand Krishna Consciousness philosophy. In the __Bhagavad-gita,__ perhaps you have read, it is said there that those who are too much addicted to materialistic way of sense gratification, they cannot put their faith in Krishna Consciousness. Anyway, whatever they are helping, that is welcome. Their record is selling nicely, and George Harrison is more inclined to our movement. Now he is not in London, because his mother is very ill and he has gone to Liverpool. I am living in the guest house of Mr. Lennon. He has spared a very nice temple house here where we hold our kirtanas, since our own temple house in London proper is under renovation.

I am so glad to learn that Candramukhi is getting Krishna Consciousness from the very beginning of her life. This is the advantage of her previous life's advancement in Krishna Consciousness. Please take care of your children and make them perfectly Krishna Conscious. That is very great service. If by your endeavor one or two souls who come under your protection become liberated in this life, that is a great transcendental service to the Lord. So I am sure your children under the care of both you and Dayananda surely have salvation in this life, along with their parents, and they will not have to come back in this miserable condition of material life. That is the injunction of __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ to the Krishna Consciousness parents. Please offer my blessings to Kartikeya and Silavati for their good service and also please hand over the enclosed note to Srimati Rekha. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
