My dear daughter Rasa lila dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your congratulations letter. Please accept my hearty thanks for your good wishes. Continue your practicing Krsna consciousness by strictly following the four rules and by always chanting at least sixteen rounds daily. These spiritual practices will make us strong and able to defend ourselves from the onslaughts of maya. Krsna is always ready to help us for He is more eager to have us come back to him than we are to go. Simply we have to accept His helping hand and then all our worries are over.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
