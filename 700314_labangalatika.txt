My dear Labangalatika,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5 March, 1970, and please let me know in which bank you have deposited the money and on what date. I advised in my previous letter that I have closed my account for the time being in Montreal, so all money should be sent to me here.

Anyway, if you let me know the name of the bank and the date, I will recover it. Henceforth, all money sent to me should be sent directly to me.

I have received word from Satyabhama that your son is doing nicely in New Vrindaban and is gaining strength in devotional service. So you are very fortunate. Krishna has blessed you with a very good devotee son. Take care of your son, and take care of Krishna and you will be happy. You are a nice devotee in the service of the Lord and that will make you always happy.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
