My dear Sripada Damodara Maharaja,

Please accept my humble obeisances. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8th April, 1970, which was addressed to my New York office. I am so sorry to learn that there is a sort of conspiracy by some of our God-brothers as not to give me a place at Mayapur. I do not wish to argue on this point, but according to your advice I have already sent a telegram to Acyutananda Brahmacari and an urgent letter also requesting him to purchase the land of Jabed Ali almost a fortnight ago, but I have received no reply til now.

So I do not know what to do in this connection. The money is there, the sanction is there, the land is there, and still if it does not take place, I shall understand it that this is not the desire of Srila Prabhupada. In the meantime, I have also advised my previous son, Sri M.M. De, to see you in this connection, and if possible to purchase the land in his name for the time being. So if he sees you, then please help him in purchasing the land.

I am sorry that you wrote me several letters before in English, but they did not reach me due to postal strike. Now I have made my World Headquarters at the above address in our own building which we have purchased very recently at a cost of 20 lakhs of rupees. So in future you can address me at the above destination.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
