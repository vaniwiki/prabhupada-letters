====== Letter to: Syamasundara ======

My dear Syamasundara Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I do not know where your address is, still I am writing this letter to you for urgent business matter. The philosophy discourses we had years ago is now lying without any utility, so all your Godbrothers are very much anxious to publish it.

I therefore request you to edit it immediately if you have time because you wanted to edit the whole thing yourself. Otherwise why not give it to some of your Godbrothers to do the task? They think this philosophy discourse will very much help our movement, so why it should be delayed unnecessarily? I hope you will do the needful without further delay and let me know the results.

I hope this meets you in good health. Now I am in Los Angeles, and am going to Dallas. Surely I will see your daughter there. From there to New Vrndavana, then to London to see how things are going on. then I shall go to India for the opening ceremonies of our Krsna-Balarama Temple. As I requested you formerly, I hope you will be present in Vrndavana.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
