Dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed is a copy of a letter I have recently received from Bahudak, president of our Vancouver temple within your jurisdiction as GBC of Canada.

Bahudak's description of his plans to move to a farm are not clear, nor have I received any letter from you in this regard, as he implies. What will be the program at this farm? How will people be attracted there? Who will work it? What about the present temple. He appears to plan to want to "close the door" to their present temple. So he has asked me for a decision, but until I know more clearly what is his plan, I cannot decide. This matter should be taken up by yourself, so please consult with him and give me a cool-headed appraisal of what Bahudak is thinking and what is the actual situation in Vancouver.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
