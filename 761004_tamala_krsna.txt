My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21st Sept. 1976 and have noted the contents. I have received and approved Ramesvara's report from Fiji. I am awaiting your report on Africa. You see what is the situation in Africa, it appears to be a little mess. Yes, that's a fact, New York is the most important city in the world, and our Temple is situated in the most important center. Jayatirtha may act as GBC for South Africa as you have proposed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
