My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. Sometimes ago you proposed that you would remain with me constantly and help me in editing my books specially __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ But now the situation is different. You are busy in some other way. This has given me much pain. However, if you still desire to remain with me and help me in editing my books, it will be a great pleasure for me, and if you so decide, you can go with me to London also. __Back To Godhead__ is now simplified and if you only send the edited matter, the rest can be managed by others. Now you decide if you can remain with me constantly like Purusottama. I hope you will discuss with me on this when you come here in the next week. As your beloved spiritual master and father, it is my duty to give you all protection; but if you allow Maya to act upon you without any resistance, then it is your own choice. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
