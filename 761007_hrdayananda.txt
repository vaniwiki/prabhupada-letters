My dear Hrdayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated, and have noted the contents.

Thank you very much for your very good printing and preaching work. May Lord Caitanya bless you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
