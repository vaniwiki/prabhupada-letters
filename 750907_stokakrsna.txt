====== Letter to: Stokakrsna ======

My dear Stokakrsna das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. Yes, you can come here and I know you can do many things, but whether you will stay here. It's like Nanda Kumara. He came and after one day he wanted to leave and return. So you should not uselessly spend money. If you are going to come, then you should remain and do work. You can come on tourist visa and stay for 6 months.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever-wellwisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
