My dear Abhirama das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 18, 1975, and upon your recommendation I am accepting the following as my initiated disciples and their names are: Sunil Awatramani---Srisatya dasa; Wayne Prabhu---Upasya dasa; Marcia Bernheimer---Gatiprada devi; Antoinette Kennedy---Gitagamya dasi; Bernadette Bonaccurso---Visnu-kanta devi.

I also accept the following as twice born initiated brahmanas: Langa Ganesa dasa, Janardana das, Nandana Acarya das, and Raghunatha Puri das. Hold a fire sacrifice and let them hear my recorded tape through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
