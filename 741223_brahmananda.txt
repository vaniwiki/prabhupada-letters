My dear Brahmananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of telegrams dated the 18th, 20th, and 21st of December reading as follows respectively: JAYATIRTHA REPORTS HONOLULU SUDAMA SUBAL BROKEN AWAY WITH SIX MEN TAKEN OVER RESTAURANT STOP TEMPLE PROPERTY IN NAME OF ONE OF THEIR MAN NOT IN SOCIETY NAME AM GOING THERE IMMEDIATELY GROUNDWORK GOING ON HERE STOP TROUBLE IN FRANKFURT SIXTY ARMED POLICEMEN RAIDED TEMPLE TEMPLE JAILED LEADERS IMPOUNDED VEHICLES AND BANK ACCOUNTS__/HONGKONG SHOULD NOT BE CLOSED ONE INITIATED CHINESE GIVES MONEY AND TRANSLATED THREE CHAPTERS GITA STOP TEMPLE CAN BE MAINTAINED BY INDIANS TRIVIKRAMA ALONE MORE MEN REQUIRED URGENTLY TOKYO TODAY__/GURUKRPA WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR JAPAN HONOLULU TEMPLE CONSTRUCTION HAS GIVEN ANOTHER 63,000 HONOLULU TODAY-Brahmananda Svami.

You should stay in Honolulu and see that things are settled up there. Sudama must return the property to the Society's name, otherwise we will take action immediately. After things are settled there, you should go immediately to L.A. and take a direct flight to London and then Germany. I want to know what has happened there. How the situation can be rectified? Please keep me fully informed of all progress.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Madhudvisa Svami has written one letter postponing the installation until May, 1975. Therefore you need not be too much hurried to finish everything by Mid-January anymore. I want to know fully what is the position of Bhaktivedanta Manor (I think it is not good) and Germany. You must analyze these problems very carefully and make frequent reports and I will give you further instructions.
