My dear Nava Yogendra Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your Vyasa Puja and Janmastami cards and I thank you very much for them. Please continue to render very nice service and certainly Krishna will be pleased upon you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
