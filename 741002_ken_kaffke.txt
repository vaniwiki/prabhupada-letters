Dear Ken Kaffke:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your card from Radha Kunda with enclosed Travelers Cheque for Dollars 50.00. I thank you for this, and I am glad to learn that you are appreciating my books. The opening of the Vrindaban temple has been postponed to after March, 1975, so if you like you can come to our Gaura purnima celebration at Mayapur and then to the Vrindaban festival at that time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
