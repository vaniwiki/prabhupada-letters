My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 25th June, 1970, and noted the contents. What has happened to Dinesh's letter to the Embassy? Please see that this permission is granted. It is very important business.

I do not know what Kirtanananda Maharaja has told you, but where there is want of pujaris only Panca Tattva picture should be worshiped by performance of Kirtana and as soon as Jagannatha or Radha Krsna Deities are installed you will require some qualified pujaris immediately. If there is scarcity of such qualifies pujaris, each center should be satisfied only by worshiping Panca Tattva of Lord Caitanya by performance of Sankirtana.

I learn that your marriage is already arranged, so I have no objection.

I am glad to learn that you are continuing your mahasankirtana, that is very nice. This is our main business. Temple worship is not so important as Sankirtana on the public roads and selling our literatures. Your class schedule is also very nice.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
