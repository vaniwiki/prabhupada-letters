My dear Professor Kotovsky,

Please accept my greetings. It was a great pleasure to talk with you on Tuesday and I hope you will kindly read the chapter of __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ which I left with you. From your book __Soviet Studies of India__ I understand that academician Mr. A. P. Baranrikov completed a great translation, working the matter of Tulsidas's __Ramayana__ into Russian. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the ripe, mature fruit of the Vedic knowledge, and Tulsidas's __Ramayana__ (Ramacharitmanasa) is but a partial representative of Srimad-Bhagavatam. The real Ramayana is Valmiki's Ramayana. Tulsidas was a devotee of Lord Rama and he has given his thoughts in his book Ramayana. But the real original thoughts and ideas are in Srimad-Bhagavatam. I have already given you a sample copy of my translation of __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ (one chapter only) and there are many hundreds of chapters like that. I think some of you should translate this great book of knowledge into Russian and it will be a great contribution. I am fully prepared to cooperate with you. India has very many authorized transcendental literatures for the benefit of the whole world. I am glad to note on page 72 of your book that "They (the Soviet scholars) regard the ancient literary heritage of India notes a petrified miracle of bygone times but as a living and growing tradition that exerts a fruitful influence on present-day literature and remains an inexhaustible source of literary and cultural development of contemporary India."

The Russian people as a growing nation and having a good feeling upon India's culture may take advantage of this treasure house of transcendental literatures, not only for the benefit of the Russian people but for the whole world. Whatever is done by a great nation or a great man is followed by ordinary persons, so it is my mission to distribute the treasure house of India's transcendental knowledge to the whole world, and your cooperation in this connection will be a great asset. You wanted to see the manuscripts of my lectures, therefore I am sending herewith an __Introduction,__ the lectures and if you so desire I shall be glad to send essays on these subjects:

1. Vedic Conceptions of Socialism and Communism

2. Scientific Values of Classless Society

3. Knowledge by Authoritative Tradition

I shall be glad to hear from you at my London address, ISKCON London, 7, Bury Place

I hope this is meeting you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
