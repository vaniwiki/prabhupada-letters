My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February*, 1973, and I have noted the contents carefully.

I don't know why they have again made the same mistake not signing jointly, but anyway you can execute the transfer without delay. I am going to India this evening and I shall talk to them further on this matter. In the meantime you can transfer the books as they have requested.

I hope everything is going nicely in Los Angeles and I shall be glad to hear from you soon to Calcutta address.

We have four places which I have visited---Melbourne, Sydney, Auckland, and Jakarta. The preaching was very satisfactory. Sriman Amogha dasa is trying to learn the local language and print some books in the Dai Nippon branch here. So cooperate with him.

Your ever-well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
