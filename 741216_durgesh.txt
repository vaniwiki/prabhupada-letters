My dear Durgesh,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 12, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully.

Thank you very much for your sentiments. It appears that you have understood our philosophy very nicely, and that is a great boon for someone who is as young as yourself. The perfection of human existence is to somehow or another develop Krsna Consciousness and the sooner that one can develop his Krsna Consciousness the better. Not that I will wait until I become old man, then I will become spiritually advanced. No, it is better if one starts immediately. So there is no question of your discontinuing your efforts in Krsna Consciousness. By all means you should continue practicing Krsna Consciousness everyday. But that does not necessarily mean that you have to move into the Temple immediately. It is also important to get some education. So for some years you should remain studying in school. But on the weekends with your parents permission you can go to the Temple and stay there but do not fall behind in your school work. And everyday you should follow the Krsna Conscious principles that our devotees in our temples follow which means rising early, chanting 16 rounds, eating only Krsna prasadam, no meat, fish or eggs, no illicit sex life, no gambling and no intoxication. This is the process. So follow it strictly and at the same time learn some practical knowledge from your school studies. And then later it may be more appropriate for you to join our temple as a full time brahmacari. But in all circumstances always chant Hare Krsna. That is a must. In the Bhagavad-gita it says; __tesam satata-yuktanam, bhajatam priti-purvakam, dadami buddhi-yogam tam, yena mam upayanti te,__ [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]]. To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me. So do not be in distress. Simply try to engaged yourself constantly in devotional service and develop your love for Krsna. And in this way Krsna will give you all facilities for coming to Him.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
