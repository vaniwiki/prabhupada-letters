My dear Svarupa Damodara dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 20th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I was very glad to receive your letter and to hear that you are feeling very happy in Krishna's service. I will be coming to Atlanta around the first week of March. Rupanuga prabhu has informed me that he will call a meeting of all the scientists in the movement at that time in Atlanta. So I will be seeing all of you there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
