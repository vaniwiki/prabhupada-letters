My dear Siddha Svarupa Ananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Sept. 25 with enclosed Guru-daksina and I thank you very much. I am pleased to accept your recommendation for the first initiation of William and Barbara Renaroza. Their names are Sakari das and Sivadasi respectively. Now hold a fire-yajna for their initiation and request them to honor the vow of following the four regulative principles and chanting of minimum 16 rounds japa daily.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
