My dear Govinda Datta,

I am in due receipt of your letter dated 1-1-75 and have noted the contents. I am very glad that you are eager to see our foreign temples and that you wanted my advice in this connection. So, I am now on tour and very soon, by the 15th of March, I will return to India. Maybe, by the 20th I will be in Calcutta and you can see me there. I shall advise you personally. You are also invited to participate in our Mayapur festival during Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's appearance day ceremony, as well as the opening celebration of our Krishna-Balarama Temple in Vrndavana on Rama-Navami day. The governor of U.P. will also come there to participate and many other important and respectable gentleman will also be coming. I hope you will also come with your wife and son and mother, and encourage us by taking part in the festivals.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
