My dear Mr. Rao,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 14th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am very pleased to know that you are feeling the greatness of the Krishna Consciousness movement. You will find that the more you involve yourself, the more you will understand our philosophy and then automatically you will be able to preach it nicely. Please continue to associate with devotees, read my books, follow all of the rules and regulations as well as chant at least 16 rounds daily and then everything else will follow automatically.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
