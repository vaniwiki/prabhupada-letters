My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th May, 1972, and I have noted the contents. Why the construction work has not yet begun? The materials were collected long ago, piles of building materials but no building. Why the plinth work is not yet begun? What is the matter? Bhavananda has just written to me also, but he also has not mentioned anything. Before you depart for Bangladesh, kindly send me photos of the construction.

I have read the letter from Turya %%___%%, so he is anxious to get our papers, so arrange to send him our English and Bengali literature and advise he should regularly get all our papers. When you go there, on cooperation with him you can establish a center in Bangladesh by mutual arrangement, and that will be very suitable for your preaching. If the Americans can take up this movement seriously, why not the Bangladesh people? Try to meet with this educated public, and if you can convince them, it will be a great service. We are trying to unify the whole population of this globe by this cultural movement. There are blessings of Lord Caitanya in this connection, and if we try sincerely it will be successful.

Now many devotees have come from U.S.A. You wanted 100 men and so now there are about 100 men, and many have come to Bombay, so engage all of them in book distribution specifically, and take with you some kirtana party, as many as you like.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
