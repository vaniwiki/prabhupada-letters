====== Letter to: Dina Dayala ======

Athens

My dear Dina Dayala,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th inst. with Greek pamphlet. This preaching work is very pleasing to me. Go on with your translation work, and Krishna will surely bless you. Thank you very much.

Do everything in consultation with the GBC. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
