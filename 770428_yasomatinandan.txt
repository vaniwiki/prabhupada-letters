My dear Yasomatinandan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 26th April, 1977.

From your report and the report of Pradyumna I can understand that the installation ceremony was performed very nicely. This is the first impetus in Allahabad. Now you organize everything very nicely. The Gujerati people are natural devotees, so if you organize them, they will come out first-class devotees. There is no doubt about this. Organize the performance of kirtan and distribution of prasadam as far as possible. That will guarantee automatic success.

I have seen the Gujerati Back to Godhead and it has been done very nicely in an improved way.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
