My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter of January 10, 1969. In the meantime I have sent one letter to Govinda Dasi, and perhaps you have read it. I am glad that there was a nice newspaper reporter, and he is favorably convinced so do your propaganda work as far as possible combined together.

It is very nice that Govinda Dasi is cooking for you and following my instructions. The husband's duty is to give the wife all protection, even from the material maya, and the wife's duty is to see to the personal comforts of the husband. In this way the husband and wife in cooperative spirit should execute Krishna Consciousness. That is my mission. In your country, practically everyone has no home life. So this Krishna Consciousness movement is giving them home life and the chance to live peacefully with wife and family.

Regarding my going to Hawaii, it is not the question that I will have to take with me my present secretary and attendant. I can go alone as you are so anxious to see me, but the most important thing is if my presence there will improve the situation of our movement and temple very nicely. In this case, I am prepared to go alone; it doesn't matter. But if you think there is no such urgency, I can wait until the rainy season is over. So in any case, do not think that I am delaying to go to Hawaii because you cannot pay for my other assistants. I came to your country alone, and if necessary, I can go to Hawaii alone still providing there is urgency.

Please continue to keep me informed of your activities and continue to spread kirtana as far as possible. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
