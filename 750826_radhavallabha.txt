My dear Radhavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 17, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the English editing discrepancies, that how can I know? Let them point out which part and on which page so I can see.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
