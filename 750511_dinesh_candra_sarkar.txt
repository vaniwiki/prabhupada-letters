My dear Dinesh Candra Sarkarji,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 16th, 1975 and have noted the contents. We are not interested to purchase any land at so high a price. That is not practical. I have already spoken with Jayapataka Swami about all details of Mayapur. You may hear from him my ideas.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
