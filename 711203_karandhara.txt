My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of November 13, 1971, in which you have recommended that Sriman Howard Sorgen and Srimate Jo An McNamara be accepted by me as my disciples. I am very glad to accept them as my initiated students, and I have given their spiritual names as Ganga Narayana das and Jaga Mohini dasi respectively. Now you must guide them very nicely in Krishna Consciousness, because you are a veteran devotee and practically speaking the future of our Krishna Conscious Society rests in the hands of my older disciples. Give them all facility to perfect their lives by protecting them and instructing them nicely, that is now the duty of my senior disciples.

Enclosed please find two copies of Gayatri Mantra and two sacred threads, duly chanted on. Two beads duly chanted by me have been sent under separate post. Hold a fire yajna and give gayatri mantra to Yasoda-jiva and Siddhesvara. You have a tape of me reciting Gayatri Mantra. One thing is that the tape should be heard through earphones into the right ear. So the fire yajna can be held for all four devotees.

I have received today one telegram from Rupanuga, informing me that MacMillan Co. is enthusiastic to print our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ 30,000 paperback and 10,000 hardback. This is very good news. Now see to it that everything is done smoothly, so that __Bhagavad-gita__ may be presented to the world without further delay.

I hope this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
