My dear Jayadvaita,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated May 26th, 1972, along with the blue-print copies of __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ from MacMillan Company. It is very nice. So I shall be looking forward to seeing the entire manuscript and book sometime around first July, 1972.

Meanwhile, hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
