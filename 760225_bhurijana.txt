My dear Bhurijana das,

Please accept my blessings. I have recently thought of a scheme to increase funds in our BBT account. I would like to send Indian goods to you for sales to the devotees and others. In the beginning I can have cloth sent, especially saris. So many others are doing it successfully, we can also be successful. I will have the papers sent through Lloyd's bank as I have an account with them in London. So you can find out the Lloyd's branch there. You can deposit all monies received from sales of the saris in the Lloyd's Bank. You may also keep a percentage of the sales for yourself. Please advise me if you are able to execute.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
