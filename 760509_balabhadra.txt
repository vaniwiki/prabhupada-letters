My dear Balbhadra das,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your kind offering of some of the honey you produce at your honey farm. As you know, I have requested the devotees here to construct one beautiful temple on the grounds in order that many people may come from all around and see the gorgeous worship of the Deities. It is a big project and will require so much capital. So if possible you can try to follow the formula recommended practically by Srila Rupa Goswami, that 50% of one's income be spent for propagating Krishna Consciousness. That will be very nice, and then your business endeavours will surely be pleasing unto the Supreme Lord, as stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam:

> atah pumbhir dvija srestha
> varnasrama vibhagasah,
> svanusthi tasya dharmasya
> samsiddhir hari tosanam
> [[books:sb:1:2:13|(SB 1.2.13)]]

"O best among the twiceborn, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties (dharma) according to caste divisions and order of life, is to please the Lord Hari."

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
