My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of you letter dated 14th September, 1971 as well as the one of Tusta Krishna dated 9th September and have noted the contents.

Subha Laksmi is a very popular singer and dancer. I know in Delhi the Ramakrishna mission with the help of Subha Laksmi singing and Prime Minister Nehru presiding, in one day they raised fund 10 lakhs. So it requires good organization and selling of tickets, etc. I think alone Subha Laksmi can contribute 5 lakhs by her performance. So this is a good opportunity to take her help. I think you should not dictate the dates for her performance. Let her fix it up and do the needful according to her convenience.

In the matter of the Amersey house, we should take into consideration the hospital just by the side of the house. So if we perform kirtana whether it will be an inconvenience to the hospital establishment. That is to be ascertained.

The Peddar Road property sounds very nice, so negotiate seriously for it, taking help from Mr. Chambria. In the meantime, if possible you can send me a little description of the house. We require a big hall. That is essential. What is the use of taking the Neapensy Road apartment if kirtana is not allowed? Better forget this place. So far Akash-Ganga, the month to month payment is very nice arrangement, so go on with it.

So far your idea to invest money, the first consideration is whether the investment will be insured or not. If it is, then you can establish what is your expenditure for one month and then calculate it for one year and then invest that amount so that the interest received will cover your expenditure. But this is not such a good proposal. Better that you maintain yourself by monthly subscription of cash and kind from so many persons. Then preaching will go on and so many persons will be benefited.

Rsi Kumar's idea to purchase a bus is a good idea, but who is going to sponsor it? It requires some expert management. You can correspond with Dayananda in London and see if it is feasible.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
