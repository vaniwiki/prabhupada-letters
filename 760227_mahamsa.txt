Dear Mahamsa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of The Hare Krishna Explosion, vol: No. 21. You must stop circulation of this paper immediately. It is not being properly managed. Who is this rascal who is writing such articles. See to this immediately.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
