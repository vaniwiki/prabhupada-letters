My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4 February, 1970. Regarding Visnujana's call to London, he has already replied in Tamala & Mukunda's letter with statement of Visnujana himself. For the time being Visnujana cannot be spared from Los Angeles. There are four experienced workers here, out of whom Visnujana is one, and three have already gone outside. Under the circumstances, he can't go to London immediately, but I have advised Hansadutta to go there and if his service can be utilized in London, because in sankirtana he is as good as Visnujana, then it is alright. Otherwise he will go to Germany. I can follow that Visnujana's service is very much needed in London but he is as much needed in Los Angeles also. So how he can be spared for London at the cost of Los Angeles business? So far brahmacaris are concerned, majorities of advanced students are in London, so why they should be lacking in training to enthuse these new brahmacaris?

In the meantime I received one letter from Balmukund Parikh. The copy of the letter and the copy of the reply also is enclosed herewith for your careful consideration. From the spirit of the letter it appears that the Indian community in London will hesitate to cooperate with our movement because they are under the impression that our members are not working outside for earning their bread, but they have taken to this sankirtana movement as means of livelihood. That will be a bad impression and will go against our movement. The court case is pending, and if somebody says against us, that here is a party begging in the street for livelihood, that will be great blot. So as suggested by Mr. Parikh, why some of the new members may not take this work? Anyway, I do not know what is the actual situation. You consider this letter of Mr. Parikh very seriously and try to convince Mr. Parikh and other Indian members that we are not begging for livelihood, but it is for expansion of the Krishna Consciousness Movement, and members who are free are working outside and giving the result of their work for Krishna Consciousness Movement. So you kindly reply this letter what you are doing in this connection. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please secure the address in Jaipur (India) of the Sri murti manufacturers. You will get it from Mr. Goyil who donated the Radha Krishna deity in London Temple. Tamala and Mukunda knows the address of Mr. Goyil or you may have it in your office file. I want such murtis for other centers. Please therefore send the address immediately.\\
