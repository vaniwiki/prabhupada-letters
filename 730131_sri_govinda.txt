My dear Sri Govinda das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 15, 1973, and I have noted the contents with great interest. It is so very nice to hear how the book distribution is going on. This is our main business, distributing these books all over the world and thus turning the minds of the fallen souls towards Krsna.

So far the court case is concerned, I shall be interested to hear the outcome. So you may keep me informed. But always remember that Krsna is the Supreme Controller of all that be.

I am desiring now to stay six months of the year in Los Angeles and six months in Mayapur, spending my time solely for the translation of __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ and other books so that I may give them to you, my sincere disciples. So it will be better arrangement now if my disciples can take up the management and active preaching. For this purpose I have created so many sannyasis. So as far as possible, try to arrange preaching programs with them as I prefer to remain now in the background translating my books.

I am glad to hear that you are taking up the program of deity worship very seriously. This is required. So everything should be first class as you have got full facility, just to the standard of Los Angeles. In Los Angeles I personally advised them in all the different aspects of deity worship, so you may consult, especially with Silavati Prabhu (now in Dallas) and do the needful. One thing though, the deity worship must be completely pure in terms of cleanliness and punctuality, otherwise there will be some offense. Regarding the Radha-Krsna Deities for Chicago, I believe that Syamasundara Prabhu is taking care of this matter so you may consult with him about the shipping date of the deities, etc. You say that you are collecting sizeable funds from incense sale and book distribution, so I expect that you will also increase your payments to my book fund as much as possible. This will be very very pleasing to me, as I am most concerned that these books of mine be printed profusely and distributed all over the world as each book has so much potency for making persons Krsna conscious. So as Chicago is one of the largest cities in the U.S., why not see if you can be the largest contributor to my book fund, although I think that you have got some stiff competition from Los Angeles branch. But if you can beat them, that will be very first class.

I am going some time this week to Australia and shall be returning to India in March, at which time we shall hold the celebration on the appearance day of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu in Mayapura. So similarly in Chicago you may have very nice celebration on that day, as it is very important occasion for us Gaudiya Vaisnavas.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
