====== Letter to: Sivananda ======

West Berlin

My dear Son, Brahmacari Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated August 21, 1968, and I declare herewith that Krishna desired you to go to Amsterdam, and therefore, you are not admitted in England. I have seen also the description of your little activities in Amsterdam, but I could not understand the language. But one thing I observed in that article, there is publication of my name, Swami A.C. Bhaktivedanta. So this indicates that your tour in Europe is going to be very successful. I am glad that you are going to West Berlin, and I hope you will duly receive this letter, and be courageous and always chant Hare Krishna. You will be successful. Similarly, I came in New York, in 1965, in the same position, and gradually many students like you have come to me. So don't be disappointed. Do and try your best and Krishna will give you all help.

I understand that one Finland young boy has joined you, similarly many other young men will come and join, because the whole world is in necessity of Krishna Consciousness. My Guru Maharaja used to say that there is no scarcity of anything in this world, save and except Krishna Consciousness. Keep your present attitude, intact; have good faith in your Spiritual Master and Krishna and everything will be all right. You have already taken this secret of success, sincerity, and pull on with that mentality. And Krishna will give you all help.

You write to say, "I really miss Swamiji and my God-brothers' association so much." But I may remind you that I am always with you. And so wherever I am there, and you are there, all your God-brothers are there. Please remember always the humble teachings that you have received from me, and that will make you always associated with me, and with your other God-brothers.

I hope this will find you in good health, and good Krishna Consciousness.

Yours ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have forwarded your letters to Gargamuni in Vancouver so that he may get courage by your example.
