Dear Dinesh Candra Sarkar:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1974. I am going to Mayapur tomorrow morning, and you are welcome to come to our Sri Candra doya Mandir there and see me.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
