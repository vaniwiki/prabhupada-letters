My dear Mr. Bhatt,

Please accept my greetings. I have received your kind letter dated 19th March and have noted the contents. I am very glad that you have appreciated our movement so nicely. I am sorry to say that I did not reach your letter until quite a few days after I left Bombay. Our festival has gone very nicely here in Mayapur. About 400 American and European devotees have come for the celebrations this year. We will all be going to Vrndavana for the opening of our Krishna-Balarama temple there on April 20th, 1975. You and your family are cordially invited to attend our functions there if it is convenient for you at that time.

Regarding your books, we are trying to organize our shipping of books in a better way, so you should be receiving them in the near future.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
