My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 29, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased to note that the French edition of __BTG__ will be ready by the end of the week. Please send a copy to me immediately when it is ready. You ask if you should improve the magazine to look like the English __BTG,__ and of course this is very welcome, but first you must organize things so that the French edition can come out regularly every month. There are plans that soon there will be a center in Paris, France, so this French edition of __BTG__ will help a great deal in the success of this center. Also, there are so many French speaking people in Canada, so please try to have this magazine come out on a regular monthly schedule. That would be very nice. Regarding the arrangements you described for having devotees come from here to work in Montreal, please send this information to Tamala Krishna, along with further details, and he will do the needful. I am pleased to note that you are selling about 25 copies of __BTG__ daily and you are going out on Sankirtana twice daily. I have learned from Brahmananda that he is increasing the number of __BTG__s to be printed from 20,000 to 25,000 copies per month. So there is much potential for selling these issues to the many people who are gradually taking more and more interest in our movement, and please organize your sales there to increase at a steady rate. Sankirtana is the tried and proven method of propagating all aspects of our Krishna Consciousness Movement, so continue to go out chanting in the streets as much as possible.

Regarding Jhulanayatra Ceremony, during these five days the Deities' clothings should be changed everyday, and there should be nice Prasadam distribution and Sankirtana as far as possible. If you are able to do it, a nice throne may be constructed on which the Deities can be placed. This throne may be swung gently during Kirtana. That will be very good, and surely the Deities will enjoy the function. You have mentioned that you have been invited to attend some "World Brotherhood Conference," and if it is convenient, you may go there with your Sankirtana Party, chant Hare Krishna, give some talk on __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ and distribute Prasadam. That is our only business, and we can do these activities anywhere; it doesn't matter on the street or in some "World Brotherhood Conference." Everyone in this material world is conditioned by the laws of Maya, so wherever we go, surely there is much work we have to do in help
