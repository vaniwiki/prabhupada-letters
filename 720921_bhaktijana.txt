New York

My dear Bhaktijana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter, undated, and I have read the contents carefully. Yes, that is a good program that you are doing in New York by going from place to place and holding classes, having __kirtana__ in the street, and generally recruiting devotees for sending to the Brooklyn Temple. If you do like that, going from one part of New York to another, New York is the biggest city in the world and there are innumerable places where you can hold chanting and classes, so if you go on like you are doing, I have no objection. But at all times, give your kind cooperation to Bali Mardan for working together on your program. He is GBC and President of Brooklyn Temple and he can give you all advice and facilities for your work. So kindly cooperate with him as much as possible, and that will please me very much. So far going to Puerto Rico, I have no objection if you go there, but if your program in New York is successful, better to develop that. But if someone goes to Puerto Rico in the future, that also sounds like a good adventure. But I think it is better to develop what we have got for now, and later on we shall see if someone can go to Puerto Rico.

You do not require to worry as I shall never leave you, you are my disciple and I am your spiritual master, so there is no question, as long as you follow my instructions, that I shall ever leave you. Just remember under all circumstances to chant sixteen rounds of __japa__ daily, offer your __prasadam__ to Krsna, and do all of the things which you already know, as you are senior disciple. These things will protect you under all conditions, without any doubt.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
