Sri Raj Kumar Gupta\\
Chandigarh

Dear Sri Guptaji:

Please accept my greetings and sincere thanks for your kindly helping our movement in so many ways. The whole world is being misled by the blind leaders; they are keeping the people in darkness. Our present position is that we have got this human form of life after a great evolutionary process and this is the opportunity to understand God Krishna, and revive our original consciousness without which we are sure to go back to the cycle of birth and death.

Krishna Consciousness movement is trying to save the people in general, religionists and philosophers, to save them from the downfall. Opening our center means to educate people in this great science. Krishna Consciousness is not a ism or simply blind following. It is based on authority; scientific and logical. I am so glad that you are trying to help us in opening this educational center in Chandigarh. Thank you very much for your help.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
