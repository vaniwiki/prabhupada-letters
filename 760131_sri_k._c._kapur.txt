Sri K.C. Kapur\\

Dear Sri Kapurji,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated January 17th, 1976.

I am remaining in Mayapur most likely until the end of March. At that time I shall be going to Vrindaban. Vrindaban and Kanpur are not far from each other, so it will be most convenient for me to come. From Vrindaban I am tentatively scheduled to go to Manipur, so I am thinking to stop in Kanpur on the way. In the meantime I am sending Sri Gopala Krishna das Adhikari, ISKCON's Zonal Secretary for India and Southeast Asia, to see the land.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
