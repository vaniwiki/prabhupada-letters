Manager, Bank of Baroda LTD.\\

Delhi\\

Dear Sir,

I beg to inform you that today I have advised the Trade Bank & Trust Co. of New York to transfer by air mail three hundred and eighty dollars and no cents ($380.00) for credit of my S.B. account No. 1432, with you.

The purpose for transferring this amount is to pay press bill in India, for printing cost. The copy of letter from Radha Press, Delhi, is enclosed herewith for your reference.

Please acknowledge receipt hereof and oblige. Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours truly,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
