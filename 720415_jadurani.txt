My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your undated note, along with sketch for cover of __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ 4th Canto, Vol. I. It is nice, the eight items are placed correctly. I have already answered your question about Nara Narayana twins. So far Lord Brahma paint him just like you have painted already in the poster where he is flying on the swan for stealing Krishna's cowherds friends and cows.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
