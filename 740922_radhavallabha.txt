My dear Radhavallabha Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14/9/74 with enclosed advance copies of BTG No. 66. The color is not at all good. It is not attractive, and not as good as Dai Nippon.

Why is the printing being changed from Dai Nippon? This Los Angeles quality is not good. The standard quality of Dai Nippon must be maintained. On what consideration is the printer being changed? I do not know anything of the printer being changed. In my opinion no one can print better than Dai Nippon. Why is the plan changed without my consent?

Why there is need of supervising the Kingsport printer? There was no need of supervising in Japan, but here it requires supervising. That means there is some discrepancy. So why these things are changed?

We cannot change the quality of printing for the matter of a little change in the price. This printing is not approved by me. Repeatedly changing of printers is not at all good. We cannot approve any printing less than quality of printing of Dai Nippon.

I am sending copies of this letter to all BBT Trustees for necessary action.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
