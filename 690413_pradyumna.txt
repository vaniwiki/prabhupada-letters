My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 9, 1969, and I have noted the contents with pleasure. I am instructing Tamala Krishna in Los Angeles to allow Jaya Gopala come to join you immediately, so I think this will be of great help to your work there. I was in San Francisco and there were three meetings there in the University campuses, and each and every one of these meetings were very successful. About 200 students in each meeting were dancing and enjoying with us. So gradually we have to organize the students to our movement, and your work so far has my approval in this connection.

Regarding your questions, generally tulsi beads are required for initiation, but if it is not available, ordinary beads can be used. Sometimes the shopkeepers give ordinary beads and say it is tulsi, so it is very difficult to get tulsi beads without personal attendance. So far as your getting a Kartamasi Murti, you may take information from Govinda Dasi in Hawaii. Radha-Krishna Murtis may be purchased from Vrindaban. The cost is about $200.00, but they are very nice, 24 inches high. I shall speak with Nara Narayana to inform him that he should also go there to help you with constructing the items you have mentioned.

Hope this finds you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
