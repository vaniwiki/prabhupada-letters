Madras

My dear Sravanananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 16, 1975 with the enclosed clipping from the "Hindu." It is very nice, and it is very good that you got responses all over India. Madras is a good field, so do your work there very carefully, and you will be very successful. Do not waste any time, but work always to please Krishna within your heart. He is witnessing everything. He only wants us to constantly remember Him. Is it very difficult?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
