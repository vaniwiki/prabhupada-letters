====== Letter to: Vegavan ======

Stockholm

My dear Vegavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 14, 1976 with enclosed copy of affidavit and I have noted the contents with care.

Now you can try to introduce all my books into the Swedish Universities just as we are doing everywhere else. Approach them with all 54 volumes in English and also in all other languages.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
