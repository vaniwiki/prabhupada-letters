My dear Madhudvisa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated dated September 6, 1974 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following as my initiated disciples.

1. Mr. Ashok Jeram Patel---Astasiddhi dasa

2. Ian Saller---Yamalarjuna dasa

Please see to it that they follow strictly the four regulative principles and chant 16 rounds minimum daily on the beads.

I hope this meets you in good health. You may chant on their beads.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
