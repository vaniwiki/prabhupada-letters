Dear Kashinath Babu;

With reference to your letter dated 25 January 1977 and your personal interview, I beg to submit that without Krsna Consciousness the disturbances of the world will increase. The disturbances by some ruffians in the vicinity of Udharan Dutta Thakur's Samity is noted by me. This can be stopped immediately if we adopt the process of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's activities are known as delivering the sinful men: papi tapi yat chila hare name udarila. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu without any discrimination used to call from all orders of life and engage them in chanting Hare Krsna Mantra. Similarly, if we make such organization in the temple of Udharan Dutta Thakur, to call everyone to join the Hare Nama Sankirtan and then distribute sumptuous prasadam certainly they will advance in spiritual consciousness and become perfect human beings. For this purpose preachers are wanted. So far as prasadam is concerned, there will be no deficiency but devotees are needed to organize this system.

Engaging people in sankirtan, either in a musical way or by spiritual discussion, people will come to their senses and stop harmful activities; gradually they will become Vaishnavas, so they will be saved from sinful activities and the society will be saved from the harmful activities of rogues and thieves. While thinking of future improvements of Udharan Dutta Thakur's temple I wish that these points be taken into consideration. We are always ready to cooperate in this preaching work. That is our mission. Thank you very much for coming here.

Yours Sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
