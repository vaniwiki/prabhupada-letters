St. Louis

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your kind letter dated December 11th, 1970, and have noted the contents with great satisfaction. I am very much willing to see your center at St. Louis, but for the time being the installation ceremony of Radha Krsna may be postponed until my further advice.

I am so glad to learn that you have increased the distribution of BTG to the extent of 3,000 per month. The collections from BTG Department may be immediately sent because they are in debt.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife. Thanking you once more for your informative letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
