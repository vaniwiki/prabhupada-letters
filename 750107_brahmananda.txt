My dear Brahmananda Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I have received you telegram dated Jan. 3rd, 1975 which read as follows: TELEPHONED ALFRED FORD PROPERTY TRANSACTION REGULAR GOING LA MONDAY THEN LONDON GERMANY PER DEC 23 LETTER JAYATIRTHA SAYS RUMOR YOU COMING HERE PLEASE CONFIRM BRAHMANANDA SVAMI. See what is the actual situation there in London. Study it very carefully and let me know how things are going. Hansadutta was giving stress to selling records using all tricks, by any means. The incident in Germany has caused havoc all over the world. It is hampering our reputation everywhere. I do not want this record distribution to continue. It must be stopped immediately. I have already informed Hansadutta. Distributing books is our real business, not these records. Has anyone ever become convinced in Krishna Consciousness by listening to this record? No. He will simply think it is nice magical sounds, that's all. But, if he reads one book, he will be convinced about spiritual life. That is our success. So, stop this record distribution immediately everywhere. And stress book distribution more and more.

Enclosed is one letter from Ajita das who is the Stockholm temple president. He is expressing the typical type of anxiety and confusion which arises from this record selling business.

The Bombay business is not yet finished. I am thinking to go to Honolulu as soon as it is finished and then on to Mexico and South America.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
