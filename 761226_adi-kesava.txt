My dear Ādi Kesava,

please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 24, 1976. I have noted the contents carefully.

__Mare krsna rakhe ke rakhe krsna mare ke.__ If Krsna protects, who can kill? And, if krsna kill, who can protect? So, if we are sincere servants, then Krsna will give us protection. Who can kill us? This Bombay land, such a huge attempt was made to kill us. Now we are the owner of this huge property. We were going to be driven out, now we are the richest men. In Bombay nobody has got such property.

The society of friends in support of the Hare Krsna Movement is a very good proposal. So, induce them to do that. That will be great success. If such persons organize a movement that the Hare Krsna Movement is genuine it is a very, very good success. Try to do it. All the scholars who have given certification will join. That will be great success if that corporation is formed. So our scholars, students like Svarupa Damodara and others can join with them to form this corporation. This should be organized. This is a very good proposal. Somehow or other try for that.

That you are gathering good support from the Indian community is nice. This Candra Swami has said that "In America there is no one turning Christians into Hindus except for the Hare Krsna Movement." That means his support is genuine, he's appreciating. Yes, it is dangerous to associate with such men, you should always remember that. But to take our interest, if the help is coming from such persons, we should not lose it also. But you must be very careful. If it is by his arrangement that we shall be able to see Carter, then we shall take advantage. If we can explain our philosophy that will be nice.

That Krsna is on our side is our only hope. Still we shall endeavor to do the needful. We want that Krsna's name will become the most prominent in the Western world, directly or indirectly. Either they paise Krsna or criticize they are being purifies. this is very curious. They are helping to sell our books. They are curious: "What is this nonsense?" That's nice that Krsna is now appearing on the front page of the New York Times.

Yes, be assured Krsna will bless you to be strong against these demons.

Regarding the use of Ostrich feathers, we don't find such things mentioned in the sastras, only peacock feathers. But, there is no harm. It is for dressing the Deity.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
