====== Letter to: Arundhati ======

My dear Arundhati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated July 7, 1969, and I have noted the contents. I know you are a very sincere devotee girl, and Krishna will bless you more and more because your qualifications are quite on the standard line. It is ordained in the Vedas that a person who has got implicit faith in Krishna and the Spiritual Master, to such person the real import of the Vedas is revealed. I see that you are chanting very nicely, you have good service attitude; so continue this attitude. You have a very nice husband also, so I shall be very glad if I see both of you advancing in Krishna Consciousness as you are doing it nicely at present. Maya is sometimes strong enough to put impediments on our progressive march. But if you stick to the principles of rules and regulations and chanting, keeping faith in Krishna and Spiritual Master, then Maya cannot touch you.

At present your most important duty is to compose books with the help of your husband. I am very much anxious to see that you begin this work as soon as possible. You have written nothing about your training in working the composer machine. I hope this will meet you in good health. Please offer my blessings to your husband and the others.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
