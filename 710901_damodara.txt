My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28th August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. It is good news that Ocean City temple, started by Baltimore and Washington centers as a summer project, has succeeded and even one devotee has come from there also. And BTG distribution is solving all financial difficulties there in Washington. So go on selling them vigorously. Sankirtana and BTG distribution are our backbone for preaching and all other things are secondary. If you can distribute one BTG you go forward one step for our preaching advancement, what to speak of distributing our books also. So do it enthusiastically and Krishna will bless you more and more.

So far your film projects are concerned, the one consideration is that the management of Washington temple doesn't suffer, but rather is actually improving its position. If that is the case and you can somehow or other find the time, then I have no objection if you take up this film-making business. No doubt there could be some positive propaganda work done in this direction. But you are in charge of that center, so do not neglect your duty.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Mriganetri and child Gulab Dasi as well as Tosana Krishna and all the others there. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
