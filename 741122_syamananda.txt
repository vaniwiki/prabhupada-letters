My dear Syamananda Das,

Please accept my well wishes. I am in due reciept of your letter dated October 7th 1974 and have noted the contents. It is best that you remain in your place and chant Hare Krishna. That is the best thing for you to do. Caitanya Mahaprabhu's position is to induce everyone to chant Hare Krishna and read Srimad-Bhagavatam. So you should do that. That will be the best service for you. In your old age you cannot work actively in propaganda work, therefore you should take advantage of the chanting and krsnakatha of Srimad-Bhagavatam.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
