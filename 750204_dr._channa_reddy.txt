**Personal.**

My dear Dr. Channa Reddy,

Please accept the blessings of Lord Krishna. The copy of your letter dated Jan. 23rd, 1975 is forwarded to me by my secretaries in Bombay and I thank you very much for your kind letter. I left Bombay on Jan. 26th, 1975 and on my way to U.S.A. I visited Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Now I am staying at the above address, Hawaii. I shall leave this place on the 9th and go to Los Angeles. From there, I shall go to South America, Mexico, Caracas, etc. Then, Puerto Rico, New York and I shall reach London by the end of this month. From there, I shall go directly to Bombay.

From the letter of the Governor of Maharashtra to you dated 20th of January, 1975, it is understood that the Governor himself is examining the case, personally. I do not know if my secretaries in Bombay have seen the Chief Minister as directed by you, but I think that when the Governor is personally examining the case, it may not be necessary to see the Chief Minister. I am also enquiring from Bombay whether they have seen the Chief Minister.

I am very much thankful to your Excellency for taking so much trouble for this noble case. Krishna will bless you with good opportunity to serve him more and more in the near future. Thank you once more.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
