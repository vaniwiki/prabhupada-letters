To ALL ISKCON Presidents:

This is to introduce Sri and Smt. Kartikeya Mahadevia of Bombay who are my good friends and our Life Members. They are now making an extensive tour of American and European cities and will be especially visiting all our centers. I want that they should be well received and accommodated and also given prasadam, and they may be offered whatever assistance they may require on their journey. Sri Mahadevia has kindly hosted me in Bombay before we have gotten our own place, so I am eager to see that he and his wife are nicely received at all our temples.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
