My dear Mr. Ravel,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your postcard and have noted the contents carefully. Yes it is a fact that this material world is a place of tortures and only by taking shelter of the Spiritual Master and Lord Krishna can one obtain relief. So it is very good that you have come to this realization. Now you must show Krishna that you are sincere and determined by taking to the chanting of the Hare Krishna Mantra. When Krishna sees that you are sincere He will bestow all blessings upon you. You will then find that this material world is no more difficult to cross then the water in the hoof-print of a calf. So, if it is possible you can join us in this sankirtana movement. Lord Caitanya has predicted that this chanting of Hare Krishna would be spread to every town and village and it is the special duty of every Indian to see that it is done. I personally have taken it up and I would be very happy to have your help. You are already doing much to help me, for this I am grateful. All my disciples who know you speak that you are doing very nice service. So continue in this way and surely Krishna will bless you.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
