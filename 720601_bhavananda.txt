====== Letter to: Bhavananda ======

Calcutta

My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 23, 1972 and I have noted the contents with great encouragement. I am glad to see that everything is going very nicely there in Calcutta and Mayapur, and that you are gradually paying back the book fund debt more and more. Regarding Mayapur building work, try to finish as quickly as possible and our living accommodations problem will be solved and I shall be very happy to stay there if it is completed when I return there in the autumn. I have received the drawing of the completed building, and it is very nice. So if you all think, Jayapataka, Tamala Krishna, and the others, my approval is there. Whatever you all decide in future in these matters, that's all right, but the structure appears to be nice. So you do not have to bother yourself by sending too many details of your progressive Mayapur construction work, simply give me simple report from time to time how the things are going on, and how ever you do it, that is to be decided among yourselves.

Go on buying the necessary land. But I think it is better to buy the land of Rohin Shaik without crop for Rs. 1500/- a bigha.

Hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
