====== Letter to: Saurabha ======

Bombay

My dear Saurabha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 9-6-76 (June 9th), and I have noted the contents with care.

I do not think that it will be a good idea to construct my residence over the Gurukula as it will be very noisy with the children there so close. You can begin the "kutir" as you mentioned by the side of the present tank, but it may require some trees and flowers and plants, then it will be alright. It is alright to have the guest rooms as shown in the plan of 3-6-76. I like the idea of being near the west gate as I want to go to the Ganges daily and during the summer I can take bath there.

It may not be a good idea to start immediately as the monsoon will check the work. The monsoon rains have already begun so how you can work? Who will take the contract to construct my house?

It has been suggested that perhaps the kitchen should be separate from the house (like in my Vrindaban house) as there is sometimes much noise coming from the kitchen. You can think this over.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. the hand-looms should also be moved if my house is going to be constructed there by the tank.
