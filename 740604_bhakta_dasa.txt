San Francisco

My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of May 21st and I have noted the contents.

I am certainly making all plans to attend Rathayatra in San Francisco on July 7th and 8th. I will be going to Australia for their Rathayatra on June 29th and after that Jayatirtha is arranging my tickets for coming to U.S. I would like to attend the Rathayatra in Chicago on July 6th and, come to San Francisco on the evening of the sixth, so you may prepare to receive me then.

Regarding your looking for a more suitable building and location for the San Francisco temple, one thing is be very careful you don't again buy a place in a bad neighborhood or neighborhood that is about to become bad. And although you are at the same time looking for a farm community land outside the city, you must keep a temple in the city of San Francisco also. So we can discuss things further when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
