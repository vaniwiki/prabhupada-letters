====== Letter to: Yasodanandana ======

Tokyo

My dear Yasodananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have heard very wonderful reports of the sankirtana being conducted by Gurukrpa Maharaja and yourself in Tokyo, and I am directing Jayatirtha to credit the Mayapur-Vrindaban fund for whatever amounts you deposit in Japan with Dai Nippon.

In the meantime I have received a letter from Trivikrama Maharaja in Taiwan who reports that many Chinese boys are coming to the center and he is very encouraged. However, he had three unsteady men in his party such as Sri Ballavha, Lalita Krsna etc., and they have left him, so that there are only two of them in Taiwan. I have heard from Sudama Maharaja that Yasodananda Maharaja was planning to go to Hawaii, but I think it would be more useful for the time being if you joined with Trivikrama and helped him in Taiwan. I am often thinking if we can get a center in China, and Taiwan is a jumping off place for our entering China. Also, although the program in Tokyo is most important, Gurukrpa Maharaja may also come and go sometimes to Taiwan and help and encourage them there. I do not think it is so far away from Japan.

Again, thank you very much for conducting sankirtana so vigorously that you are outdistancing all other parties. Your special affection for my Indian project is very pleasing to me and shows you understand my intentions very well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
