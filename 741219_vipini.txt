====== Letter to: Vipini ======

Washington, D.C.

My dear Vipini das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 7, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully.

I have received your check for $200.00 and appreciate it very much. As far as your engagement is concerned I think it is most appropriate for you to consult with the GBC men. But one thing that everyone should understand is that I am not so interested in selling incense as I am in selling books. Distribution of my books is the most important thing. These other things such as selling incense, records etc., are not so much important as this. If Spiritual Sky is a separate concern then what is the need of our own men who are capable preachers to be engaged in that way. I want that my books be distributed in huge quantities, and thus we will be able to thoroughly convince the majority of the population especially there in America. But finances are also needed. Therefore for further direction you please contact the GBC men and they will give you consultation. The more one preaches the more he becomes expert and the more he is able to convince others.

Concerning your marriage ceremony that is to be sanctioned by the temple president or GBC.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
