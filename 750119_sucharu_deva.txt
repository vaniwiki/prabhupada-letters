My dear Sucharu deva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. Please try and work nicely with Mahamsa Svami. He is very nice devotee and he can help you to be engaged in Krishna's service with great enthusiasm. I will be coming there shortly---in April, for a large pandal program. You can see me then. For the time being, try to be very staunch in following all the rules and regulations. Chant 16 rounds daily, attend mangala arati and classes, etc. and you will be very happily engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord, Sri Krishna. Never let a moment go by without engaging in at least one of the nine devotional processes.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
