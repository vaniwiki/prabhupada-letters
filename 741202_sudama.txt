My dear Sudama das Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 21, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully. I had asked you not to open the restaurant. Do not open the restaurant. Stop this. It cannot be managed.

Regarding the complaints against yourself you have mentioned, I do not find any complaints. But even if there should be such complaints, you must remain pure, and automatically the complaints will vanish. And, if there is any truth in the complaints, you should rectify and be purified.

Regarding the other matters, these things you please consult amongst yourselves and do the needful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
