My dear Mr. Patel,

Please accept my greetings. I have duly received your check for 200.00 dollars forwarded to me at our Vrndavana branch. Thank you very much for this kind donation. I hope that you are finding the time to visit our Montreal temple frequently, and that you are finding our books interesting to read. By associating and rendering service to the Vaisnavas and hearing the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-bhagavatam as well as chanting Hare Krishna, your life will become perfect.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
