My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter dated Dec. 15 in hand. I am very glad to know that you are helping your God-brothers in Boston, just like the Queen of King Jadu. King Jadu was a very powerful King and Jadurani was his constant companion. Krishna selected to appear Himself on this earth planet, selecting the Jadu Dynasty as His Predecessors. So your help to your God-brothers just apt your nice name.

Regarding your coming to San Francisco, I have no objection, but because you are only three in Boston, your absence may be felt by your other God-brothers. So if Satsvarupa agrees to leave you, you can come to S.F., otherwise, wait for the proper time. Now by Krishna's Grace, we have got many fine art students like Govinda dasi, Indira dasi, and Malati and many others. So as director of the art dept., you should organize them in one place and overflood with pictures. We require these pictures in large quantities both for selling and for decoration. So I think you should immediately organize these potential artists in one place, either in S.F. or N.Y., or wherever you like, and give daily at least one dozen pictures.

You should think of this line and how we can help you and how your God-brothers can help you.

I have no objection to your sending to N.Y. for the print of Panca-tattva.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
