My dear Jivananda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 8, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your kind donation for 108 dollars (in check). I hope that you are being very careful to strictly observe all of our basic rules and regulations such as rising early (before 4:00 AM), attending mangala arati and classes, chanting 16 rounds without fail and of course the four regulative principles. Without accepting these things seriously, there is no question of spiritual life. So, I hope you understand the utmost necessity of these things and are remaining pure in your activities.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
