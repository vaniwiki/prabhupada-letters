My dear Murari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 6, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am so pleased to learn that you have obtained a permit for soliciting on Sankirtana Party, and now you are collecting $60 daily. It is very encouraging news. Regarding __BTG,__ you should purchase at least $350 worth of copies per month. This means you get 2,500 copies, and the price is 15 cents per copy. The price for selling is declared at 50 cents, so there is a 35 cents difference. So even if you make at least 20 cents profit per copy, that is $500 per month for your temple. Now you have got good opportunity for selling, so you help __BTG__ by contributing this amount monthly. I have heard that you have mentioned to Brahmananda that your temple will contribute $3,000 dollars for my book fund. This is very good news for me, and try to send it as soon as possible. I am so pleased that you are arranging for the Rathayatra Festival very nicely, and similarly in London, Buffalo, and what to speak of San Francisco, they are arranging. In San Francisco it is going to be unique thing in this world. Regarding a house, you look for a place. Krishna will provide for the funds. Now, because Los Angeles has got a nice church, the situation has improved very hopefully. They are getting all help. In Sankirtana they are collected sometimes $250 daily, and selling __BTG__ not less than 150 copies daily. Boston is not a small city, and it is better than Los Angeles because you have so many students there. So try to organize very nicely.

I have not heard anything from Lilavati for some time. How is your daughter, Subhadra? I received one check from Jadurani for $30 for my maintenance fund, and thank her very much for this. I have sent two tapes to Satsvarupa with a note to Jadurani. Please ask them to take care of them and do the needful.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
