My dear Vibhavati devi;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 29th, 1974 and have noted the contents. So whether you are alone or with your husband you must continue to follow the regulative principles. Why there should be any misunderstanding between a Krishna conscious husband and wife. This is not good. Anyway wherever you get place, you should go and always remember Krishna and never forget Him for a moment.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
