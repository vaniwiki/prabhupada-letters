My dear Pradyumna and Arundhati,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much anxious to hear from you. In my last letter I was informed by you that you were going to send me some specimens of the composed version of __Nectar of Devotion,__ but I have not received anything till now. Besides that, you have not called for the remaining portion of the manuscript. This means the major portion is not yet composed. In the meantime, the press is ready. The press has already begun to print, and without having any book ready, they are printing other materials. But the press is specifically meant for printing my books. So far as I can understand, 12 or 13 books are ready for going to the press. Simply they require to be composed. So please let me know what is the exact position why the work is going slowly. Here some respectable friend has promised to publish my book, __Krsna,__ in two parts. The manuscript is also ready. So after __Nectar of Devotion,__ I want to take up this work immediately. Formerly the plan was that Arundhati and Syama Dasi combinedly will compose at least 20 pages daily under the guidance of Hayagriva and Pradyumna; Pradyumna will be responsible for the diacritic marks and Hayagriva for correct English and grammatical composition. This was the arrangement. The press is ready, the manuscripts are ready, but I find from your department things are not up to the standard. So please let me know what is the position whether it is possible for you to take this responsibility. If you take the responsibility, what is the difficulty that things are going so slowly? I shall await your reply to this letter and shall thank you very much in anticipation.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
