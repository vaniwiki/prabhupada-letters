New Vrindaban

My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 8, 1976 and I have noted the contents carefully. Why should they complain about the way we are living there? We have our cottages and we take our own food. However, if it is necessary to make alterations, you can do. Concerning plumbing indoors, that is not difficult. This can be done very easily if you have a high water tank, and sufficient water there. Just like sometimes we see at big, big factories. If the water supply is sufficient, there is no question of insanitation. Disease comes when there are dirty conditions. Also, don't eat more than necessary. As soon as palatable food is offered, they eat. That is the disease. Concerning the outhouses, if they are not approved then you can have a septic tank, or pass stool in the open field. I was doing that. I never liked to go to the nonsense toilet so I was going in the field.

Your request to take out a loan in books can be arranged so it is good idea. I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
