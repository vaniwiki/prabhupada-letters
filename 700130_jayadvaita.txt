My dear Jayadvaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge reciept of your letter dated 28 January, 1970.

I am very glad to learn that __Nectar of Devotion__ is now completed. You have inquired about the quality number 63 of Krishna that He is surrounded by loving devotees can be explained as follows: When we speak of Krishna, Krishna is not alone. Krishna means His name, His qualities, His fame, His friends, His paraphernalia, His entourage---everything included. Just like when we speak of a king, it is to be understood that he is surrounded by ministers, secretaries, military commanders and many other people. Krishna is not impersonal, so in His Vrindaban Lila especially, He is always surrounded by the Gopis, cowherd boys, His father, His mother and all the inhabitants of Vrindaban.

Regarding your second question, Byabhaichary, you have got 31 only out of 33. I think some of the brackets are not counted. So if the parentheses are removed from "intoxication" and "impotency" and they are also counted, the total of symptoms will come to 33. Simply add commas after the preceeding symptoms namely "prestige" and "impudence" respectively.

Regarding the third point: all kinds of mellow includes servitude. Therefore a mixture of servitude and parenthood is not incompatible. So Ugrasena's mellow is correctly written as mixed with servitude and parental affection and the statement in part IV should be corrected to state that a mixture of parenthood and servitude is a compatible one.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
