My dear Jayadvaita:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 8, 1973 and have noted the contents. With regard to this problem I recommend that in your diet you take no spices. Furthermore you should see that the bowels are cleared daily.

I hope this meets you in best health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
