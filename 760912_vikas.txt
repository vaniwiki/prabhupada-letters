Calcutta

My dear Vikas,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8 September 1976. I am very very sorry to learn that your father has expired. Your father was my class friend and neighborhood friend. During the time of your grandfather your whole family was living at Varanasi Ghose St. Our residence was on the same street and because we went to the same college, Scottish Church College, and were in the same class, we were very intimately connected since 1916, more than 50 years.

Naturally I am very very sorry to learn the death news of your father, my beloved friend. So offer your mother my condolences for the bereavement, but there is nothing to be very sorry for. According to __Bhagavad-gita__ your father has not died, he has changed his body, __na hanyate hanyamane sarire__ [[books:bg:2:20|(Bg. 2.20)]].

Certainly I shall pray to Krishna for his better situation in the next life. Offer my blessings to your children and wife and I hope that this meets you in good health. I will most probably be in Calcutta in December next and I shall be glad to see you at that time.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
