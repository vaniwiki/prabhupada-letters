My dear Rsikumar,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 14, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I can understand that you are very interested in Sankirtana Party, so you may be in charge of this activity in the New York temple. Because Murari has gone to Boston, I think Brahmananda will feel very much if you also leave, so stay in New York to help in the organizing of New York Sankirtana Party. If you have some time, then help Gargamuni. Otherwise, if you do not like to do it, I do not press you in this matter.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
