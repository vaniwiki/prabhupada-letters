Karantaka

My dear Embar Sampath Kumarchar,

I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2/1/77 and have noted the contents.

Whether you will be able to teach our boys Sanskrit in the standard way? That is the first question. Have you ever worked as a Sanskrit teacher anywhere? To teach these young boys requires special technique. Whether you know it? We have reports from the U.S.A. about you just to the contrary. Kindly reply this point.

We don't pay any salary to anyone. You can bring your aged parents to Vrindaban. They shall also be provided and you can take personally care of them.

What for do you want to go to Atlanta? I have received a letter from Atlanta. They haven't mentioned that your presence is required there. So, why do you want to go there and waste money? If you have got money keep it with you. Don't spoil it unnecessarily. Concentrate on bhajan along with your father and mother. That is my advice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
