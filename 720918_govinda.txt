Honolulu

My dear Govinda dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I have received again today your shipment of mangoes from Hawaii, and I have received other mangoes in the last few days, and I thank you very much for thinking about me. And I am always thinking about you, along with your good husband Gaurasundara, because you have been of such good assistance to me for pushing on this Krsna Consciousness movement in your country and other places around the world. Without your kind assistance and thinking of me, I am one old man, what could I do alone? But fortunately Krsna has sent you to assist me and I can appreciate it very much, may Krsna give you his all blessings more and more.

Now I am preparing to go to India some time in middle of October month, and I want to stop in Honolulu for one night to rest, and Siddhasvarupananda can meet me there for coming with me to India and remaining with me for some time. I shall be very glad to see all of you, my good disciples, at that time. Meanwhile, hoping this meets you and your husband in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
