My dear Kurusrestha Das,

Please accept my blessings. . . I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 5, 1973 with enclosed pictures, and you have given me much pleasure. The altar is very nice and so are all the pictures. It appears to be very neat and clean. Please keep this standard. The tulsi also is very nice. It is a fact that the American people are the most fortunate in the world, and that this Krsna consciousness movement is the final touch of fortune. You are doing very nicely, and I thank you very much.

Your high school classes are very nice. Take care of the young people for a future Krsna conscious generation. The worship of Lord Jagannatha must go on nicely and cleanly. Regarding your Sankirtana, yes, if anyone chants, tries to follow the rules and regulations, and reads our books, he'll be successful in his life.

Regarding the initiations, I am pleased to accept the following as my disciples:

Pancanand das---Mike Price\\
Vamsidas---Tom Harovtunian\\
Srinivasa das---Hans Olson\\
Virachandra das---Dick Erdel\\
Bhaktapriya dasi---Christene Mossain

Also enclosed is the sacred thread for Makhana Taskara. Let Karandhara chant on the beads and hold a sacrifice. The gayatri mantra should be heard through the right ear from the tape. Please see that all the new disciples do nicely and always chant Hare Krsna.

Yes, when I go to Los Angeles next, I will surely come to your Denver temple. The pictures you have sent attracts me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
