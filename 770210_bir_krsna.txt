Caracas

Dear Bir Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your report of January 23, 1977, and examined the contents.

Your dedication to translating and distributing my books in Caracas is very pleasing to me. This will be the most effective method for carrying out Lord Caitanya's prediction that the chanting of Hare Krsna will be taken up in every town and village of the world.

The purpose of this Krsna Consciousness movement is stated by Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the Caitanya Caritamrta:

> Bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
> janma sarthaka kari kara para-upakara
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|(Cc. Ādi 9.41)]]

"One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people." It is for doing good to others. So you should understand that as I have taken up this mission with full faith in my guru maharaja, as you also preach earnestly in the countries of South America, you will do the highest good for others and for yourself as well.

Your statement that Guyana is a communistic county but still we are successful in getting people to chant Hare Krsna, is significant. The communist movement is artificial, but the chanting of Hare Krsna is the real and natural situation. Go on cooperating with Hrdayananda Maharaja and gradually spread the book distribution to every home in South America. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
