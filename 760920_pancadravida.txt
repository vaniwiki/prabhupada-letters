My dear Panca Dravida Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3, September, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. On your recommendation I am accepting the following as my duly initiated disciples.

__First Initiation__

Bhakta Gustavo---Gunesvara dasa

Bhakta Damian---Deva-srestha dasa

Bhakta Marceline---Mathura-mandala dasa

Bhakta Javier---Japananda dasa

Bhakta Kique---Kasi Misra dasa

Bhakta Osvaldo---Agnipati dasa

Bhakta Juan---Sacisuta dasa

__Second Initiation__

Caitanya Svarupa das brahmacari

Nitya Tripta das brahmacari

Hold a fire sacrifice and Hrdayananda Maharaja may chant on the beads. Give the bead, threads, and names at this time and the gayatri mantra may be heard by tape through the right ear. All initiated disciples must chant at least 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Maha-mantra daily on the beads and the brahmanas must remain clean outside by regularly bathing and clean inside by chanting the maha-mantra.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
