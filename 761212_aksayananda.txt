My dear Aksayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8th December, 1976.

You have sent me the balances recorded in the passbook, but I want the balance according to the bank. Please do this immediately. Find out from the bank manager what the balance of these two accounts are and send the information to me immediately. Also, what is the progress with the municipal affairs? Please send me a full report.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
