My dear Kadamba dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your note and gift of one ring. Just now I am wearing it. Because you have sincerely offered, I must accept on behalf of my Guru Maharaja although I am not worthy.

I have met your son. His lovely features are very nice and he appears to be a first class brahmacari. Always be an example to him by being steadfast in Krsna Consciousness and your motherhood will be perfected.

Hare Krsna. I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
