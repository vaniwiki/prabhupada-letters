My dear Jadurani devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated August 14 & 20, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding Picture #1, it was not enclosed, but yes Mother Yasoda feeding Krsna is parental love, or sometimes you can show Krsna with great difficulty placing the slipper of Nanda Maharaja on his head. Yes, sketch #2 is all right; it is supported in the Caitanya Caritamrta. #3 is also all right. #4 is also all right. Regarding #5 Visnu, Laksmi must always be with Mahavisnu. Yes there should be devotees around the garden or town. Yes, they would look like Visnu. Lord Visnu is never alone. Inside the building is proper. #6 of Krsna and Balarama fighting as bulls is completely rejected by me. It is not good. You have made it demoniac. Make Them as they are themselves, as boys fighting. Never show like this. Everything is there in the Krsna Book. Don't imagine.

Regarding question #7 why red background? You can show the full Visnu form. Regarding #8 the color is referred to in the text, so you have to see that portion of the book.

Regarding your letter of August 20, Narada can have yellow dhoti. Brahmacaris can be shown in both yellow or saffron, both are correct. Yes, you can make the flower ships as you have described. Why have you discontinued writing the mantras on the bottom of the portrait paintings?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
