My dear Sucandra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10th September, 1971 and have noted the contents. Your duty is to take charge of your wife. So you can stick to your job and maintain your wife and family and give as fast as possible to the Hamburg temple. You cannot be irresponsible to your wife and child. That is not allowed. If you can go with your wife to Munich to open a center there certainly I have no objection. That is a different thing. But you cannot leave your wife to go to Munich.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
