My dear Jayatirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram in which you inquire about making available $130,000 for use by the Spiritual Sky Touring program bringing life members on a tour around the world. This touring program has been postponed. So for now do not bother about this capital.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
