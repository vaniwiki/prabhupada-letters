My dear Jaya Tirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of May 25, 1974 with the list of names for initiation.

I appreciate that you say you have very carefully considered the names and the candidates have had several interviews and written statements before you would consider them, both for first and second initiation. I am especially concerned that the second initiation not be taken cheaply and devotees who do not even rise early be recommended for brahmana. Therefore I have accepted the devotees recommended by you and their new spiritual names are as follows:

John Maley---Caitanya Simha dasa

Rhonda Maley---Racitambara-devi

Eugene Edwards---Urjasvat dasa

Mark Molinero---Mahesvasa dasa

Kathryn Ruesnik---Kusala devi

Joe Masters---Jitamrtyu dasa

Sharamine Bruce---Sailodgata devi

Alfredo Ruiz---Abhipraya dasa

Michael Pickup---Manya dasa\\
You may hold a fire yajna and chant on their beads and impress on them they are taking vows before Radha-Krsna, the spiritual master and the Vaisnavas. They must always chant at least 16 rounds daily and avoid the four sinful activities.

The brahmanas threads and gayatri are enclosed for brahmacaris Hasyapriya, Bopadeva, Dharmaksetra and Anila and the girls Meena Arcana, Pancali, Mulaprakrti, and Mahati devi.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
