My dear Ananga Mahan dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 31-5-75 and have noted the contents. I am returning to Vrndavana by October. At that time, you please see me, and we shall talk about your program.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
