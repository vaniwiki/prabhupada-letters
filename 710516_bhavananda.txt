====== Letter to: Bhavananda ======

Brooklyn

My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5th April, 1971 and just received by me yesterday. I am so glad to hear how rapidly our New York center is expanding and how enthusiastic the devotees have become. That is first class qualification for making advancement in Krishna Consciousness.

Yes, Mr. Faramarz Attar will certainly be a great asset to our society and I am glad to accept him as my initiated disciple. His spiritual name is Atreya Rsi. Of the seven great Rsis, one of them is Atreya Rsi. And Concetta Bologna has also been accepted. Her name is Bhadra Devi Dasi. Bhadra means gentle and is another name for Durga, like Subhadra. I have received their money orders for beads and they will be arriving by separate post.

It is so much encouraging to hear how eagerly the high school boys and girls are taking to your preaching, so continue this program. All glories to Lord Krishna! And the devotees there are also so much eager. Very good. I shall be returning very soon. And thank you very much for your good feelings. Krishna will surely bless you.

Yes, Svarupa Prabhu has my permission to get himself married to Suzy O'Neil.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there in New York center. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. The Calcutta function is going very superbly.\\
