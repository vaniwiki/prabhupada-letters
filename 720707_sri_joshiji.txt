Dear Sri Joshiji,

Please accept my greetings, and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 27, 1972, and I thank you for your proposal for cooperating. I did not reply your letter earlier as I was preparing to come here to London.

Your proposal to cooperate with this movement is very magnanimous, and I thank you for your suggestion. But before doing anything tangible, I wish to discuss with you in detail. I wanted to see you in Los Angeles, but I could not get up to San Francisco, neither you could come to L.A. Now I shall be away from California for about one month, but when I shall return we shall discuss further this matter. I welcome your suggestions for voluntary service. Thank you very much.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
