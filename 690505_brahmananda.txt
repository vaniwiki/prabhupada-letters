====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated April 28th, 29th and 30th, 1969, along with the credit note of the Bank, #2880. Regarding the United States Customs, we had been importing books from India, and I do not know what is wrong there if we import books from Japan. So far as publication is concerned, our Society has got branches all over the world. It is written in the book "published by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, branches throughout the world, Headquarters USA". So if we have got branches in Japan and get our books printed there, what is wrong there? I think this complaint has no meaning.

Regarding Dai Nippon's change of policy, I know the Japanese people are very cunning in the matter of business. They can produce things very cheaply and attract customers, but when the customer is in his grip, he does not behave very well. Under the circumstances, I do not know whether it will be nice to select another Japanese printer. The best thing will be if we get them printed in New York as I suggested to Rayarama and also Uddhava. Uddhava and Vaikuntha are very much hopeful for collecting for the book fund, and they have promised that at least $20.00 can be collected daily. Regarding the musical instruments, I do not think there need be any discount on them. So far as sending the book to Gaurasundara, you can send him one copy of __Caitanya Caritamrta,__ and explain to him that out of his $100.00 there is no balance, so he can send the price of that book.

Now immediately you have to send some papers to Syamasundara in London as follows: the picture of Vaikuntha Loka on one side, and an advertisement of __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ on the other side. Send a few copies of this cover as well as the picture of the Prime Minister meeting me with the __Bhagavatam,__ the recent dust cover of __Teachings of Lord Caitanya__ and __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ Syamasundara requires to prove our bonafideness, and from here I am sending the copies of our certificate. He is expecting something big, so let us hope for his success, although up till now we have been satisfied simply by promises. His address is as follows: 11 Walham Park Road, London S.W. 12, England. As I have mentioned to Uddhava, Murari may stay in New York to help Gargamuni at least till I go to New Vrindaban.

Please convey my blessings to all others there. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
