Dear Shri Giriji,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated.

As I am planning to go out of Bombay in ten days time, I have sent a copy of your letter to my old friend and associate, Dr. G. Ghosh. Kindly see him. I have requested him to engage some lawyer for this purpose.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
