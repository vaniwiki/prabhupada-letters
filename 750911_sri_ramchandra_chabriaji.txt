Sri Ramchandra Chabriaji\\
Soa Palaco Road\\
26, Strand Road\\
Bombay-1

My dear Sri Ramchandra Chabriaji:

Please accept my blessings. Here in Vrindaban we have constructed one Guest House by our Krishna Balarama Mandir. The Guest House contains 44 Guest Rooms not including the rooms for our own men.

I wish that you may kindly come here to Vrindaban to train up my men how to organize and run the Guest House nicely. I think one week will be sufficient. We shall pay all your expenses in coming and going from Bombay.

I am here in Vrindaban, and shall look forward to seeing you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
