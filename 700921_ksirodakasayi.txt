My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 30th August.

Regarding arranging your tour, you should make your plans as you think best. This I will leave up to you. There are now ten devotees with me here and I expect 20 more men and women from the U.S. and Europe to come within a month. So I cannot say now definitely what will be our program. You make a nice program and when you arrive we can then make further arrangements as necessary.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
