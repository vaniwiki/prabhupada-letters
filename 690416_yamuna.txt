My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I am replying to your nice letter dated April 10th, 1969. The description of your dream is very fascinating. It appears that you are constantly thinking of me and Lord Nrsimha has given you the chance to see Him because of your constant devotion. It is very encouraging. I understand that all of you are not living together. Just today I received one letter from Syamasundara and his return address is again a new address on Balham Park Road. In his letter he says that he is leaving for Leicester (80 miles from London) for preparing an altar for Mataji's new temple. So if you are living at Mataji's, then does it mean that you are 80 miles off from London? I do not think so, but please clarify the situation. I am receiving letters from different sources, and I do not know where to reply home.

Regarding your questions about Deity worship, please refer these to Himavati in Montreal or else Harsarani in Los Angeles. Yes, on the certificates you may correct it as __Srimatee.__ I hope this will meet you in very nice health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
