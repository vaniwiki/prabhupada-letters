====== Letter to: Tosana Krsna, Bhurijana ======

My dear Tosana Krishna and Bhurijana,

Please accept my blessings. I am very happy to be in receipt of your nice letter of March 6, 1969, and thank you very much for it. Yes, you are two ideal ones for preaching there, and I can understand that things are going very nicely. This is very much encouraging to me. Hold kirtana and serve Prasadam, and gradually people will come, more and more. That is the program. And you are both sincere students, and very intelligent boys, and Krishna will supply you all facility for your preaching work if you try sincerely.

Please keep me informed how things are progressing as I shall be very much anxious to hear from you. And I hope you are both feeling well and happy,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am sending today the letter to your draft board, and I am enclosing the copy of it herewith, for your reference, and I hope this will serve the purpose nicely.
