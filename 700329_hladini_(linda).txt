====== Letter to: Hladini (Linda) ======

Detroit

My dear Daughter Hladini Dasi (Linda),

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter dated 26th March, 1970, asking to become my initiated disciple in Krsna Consciousness and also your beads for chanting. I am very glad to know that your are strictly observing the rules and regulations of Krsna Consciousness faithfully and now I am very glad to accept you as my initiated student. I am returning your beads herewith duly chanted by me.

Your initiated name is Hladini devi Dasi. Lord Krsna's Pleasure Potency is called Hladini, so this spiritual energy of Krsna's pleasure potency, Hladini, is Srimati Radharani Who is always increasing the transcendental pleasure of Krsna by Her super-excellent loving devotional service. Radharani is the most confidential servant of the Lord and Hladini Dasi means the servant of Radharani. So please always be engaged in chanting Hare Krsna mantra at least sixteen rounds daily and work sincerely and eagerly in the service of the Lord observing the regulative principles and thus be happy.

I am also pleased to know that you will be married with Sriman Mahananda in Krsna Consciousness and that you offer your children to Krsna is very, very nice. May Krsna bless you both to work combinedly for mutually advancing in Krsna Consciousness more and more.

I have written to Mahananda that my suggestion is that after some time training in Detroit with Bhagavan das you can try to expand our activities by opening a branch in some suitable place. That will be very nice. So please chant Hare Krsna and be happy, that is my desire.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
