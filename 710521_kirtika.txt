My dear Kirtika (Judith Cornell),

Please accept my blessings. Rupanuga Prabhu has recommended you for initiation and I am so glad to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. I have given you the spiritual name Kirtika Devi Dasi. Kirtika is the name of one of the gopis. Also your beads have been duly chanted on by me and are enclosed herewith.

The gopis are so much engaged in the transcendental loving service of Radha and Krishna that they are condemning the creator, Lord Brahma for not knowing how to make perfect eyes. They were disturbed that when blinking their eyes, they could not see Krishna. So that is perfection in Krishna Consciousness; to be so much engaged in Krishna's loving service that you cannot bear separation from that service, not even for a moment. So somehow or other always be engaged. And if there is nothing else, you can always sit down and chant Hare Krishna Mantra. 16 rounds daily is the minimal requirement, but you should chant Hare Krishna as much as possible. And follow all the regulative principles strictly. Read all our books, attend classes and go for street Sankirtana. In this way be engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be happy and in the end you will go back home, back to Godhead.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
