My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter October 31, 1968, and I am so pleased to know that you are now quite able to work. May Krishna bless you with good health and continue your prescribed duties very nicely.

Regarding the picture, Panca-tattva, I do not think there is necessity of putting them in perspective. Actually they are standing on the same line. Just like a group photo is taken and nobody looks smaller or greater. That is the system. But the thing is that if you make Lord Caitanya smaller, that would not be nice. He should be larger, and actually he was very large and broad shouldered. So better to paint as you have been doing, and with Lord Caitanya a little larger.

Murti means a worshipable statue.

Hoping you are in good health always,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
