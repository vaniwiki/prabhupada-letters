My dear Prabhas das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your Bengali letter dated 6 February 1976.

In reply I have sent you one telegram as follows: Prabhas immediately come to Mayapur. Signed: Bhaktivedanta Swami.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
