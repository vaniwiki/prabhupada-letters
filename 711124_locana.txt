My dear Locana das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of November 3, 1971, along with the six letters requesting initiation and the daksine sum. By your recommendation, I am happy to accept the six as my disciples and their names shall be as follows: 1) Joan Cerando/Ratnesvari Dasi; 2) Larry Batcheldor/Lokanatha Das; 3) Barbara Batcheldor/Vrajasundari Dasi; 4) John Warren/Yogescandra Das; 5) Beverly Warren/Varahadeva Dasi; 6) Tom Hopke/Nalinikanta Das. I am replying all of them separately also.

I am very pleased that you have accepted the responsibility of managing such an important center as Berkeley. I know that there are many students in that city, so just attract them to our Krishna Consciousness Movement by giving them prasadam and our Krishna philosophy. We can challenge any nonsense philosophy. Socrates, Plato, Kant, Darwin---all of them---so many mental speculators and word jugglers who have misled so many people. Now it is your task to find them out and expose them, so that the people may appreciate the real philosophy. We must become now very serious to save the people of the world from this very dangerous situation. So become very convinced yourself of our philosophy and then your preaching will act. And try to sell as many books as possible at all the schools and colleges. This is scholarly information, flawless science. Kindly assist me in this great work, and know it for certain, that by your sincerely working in this way you shall very soon go back to Home, back to Godhead.

I hope this meets you in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
