My dear Brahmananda,

Accept my blessings. I am always thinking of your separation feelings. Please do your duty nicely and Krishna will help you in all respects. We are delayed here for 16 hours. Starting this morning at nine for Delhi. The attention of Mr. B.K. Nehru the Ambassador of India was drawn to me the other day. I have told him about my permanent Visa and he has promised to help me when I come back. Please make an appointment with him informing that I wish to present him our set of Bhagavatam and our other literatures. Then go to him and personally present the books etc. at Washington D.C. It may be that I shall be coming back very soon as soon as I feel some strength. Up to now there was no disturbance about my health and I hope to reach Delhi this night. I shall write you again after reaching Vrindaban. Convey my ardent affection and blessings for all the boys and girls. I am very much hopeful of my movement. Please keep steady, follow all my instructions scrupulously, chant Hare Krishna and Krishna will give you all strength. Hope you are all doing well. I am

Yours ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
