My dear Hansadutta das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 10, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the house in Almora, yes it is a good proposal. I shall like to stay there. Almora is a good place. You may go see the house personally.

Regarding the closing of Zurich center, that's all right. Don't make competition.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
