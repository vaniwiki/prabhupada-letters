My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. It is my desire that you may not change your present program for going to Washington. I have advised Brahmananda to send Purusottama to Buffalo. In the meantime, I am also writing one letter to Mr. Goel; the copy of my recent speech on Krishna Consciousness I will send to him. Also, I am sending you one copy of said speech, and it may be published in Back to Godhead. I have also sent this speech to West Germany. Find herewith enclosed copy of letter to Mr. Goel, and speech. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
