====== Letter to: Syama ======

San Francisco

My dear Syama dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I understand from Hayagriva that now you are living in San Francisco along with your youngest son. I hope that you are doing well, but I shall be glad to see you in Los Angeles by the 2nd of June, 1976, when I shall be arriving there.

I hope that this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
