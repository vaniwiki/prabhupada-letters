My dear Pusta Krsna Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I have been informed of the situation of the South African program by Brahmananda Swami who is here with me now as personal secretary, and I want to send you there. There is one boy there Ksudhi Dasa who is very young boy, so I want you to go there to take charge of the preaching program there in Durban.

One Mr. Parekh of the Hindu Mandal has written me inviting me to go there and they will pay all the tickets. q 750615 750615 So I want to go there from London on my return to India, and I can stop there. So you go there and make all the arrangements and inform me accordingly and I can come.

You can correspond with Ksudhi Dasa Brahmacari at the following address: c/o Popatlal Kara, 201 Gray St., Durban, South Africa, for getting the visas. It will be easier for you to go from London.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
