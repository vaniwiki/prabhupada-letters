My dear Meenakatan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge reciept of your letter dated 12/7/72, and I have noted the contents. Thank you very much for the sincere sentiments expressed therein, and I am very much pleased that you are happy in Krishna Consciousness. For the time being, you may assist Subala Maharaja by working there in Delhi for collecting and making Life Members for the Vrindaban project. At present there is shortage of men to help there, so kindly give your full co-operation. For now, I am not making any more sannyasis, but we shall see later on.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
