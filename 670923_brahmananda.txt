My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept blessings. I have not heard from you since a long time. I hope everything is going on nicely. I think the MacMillan transaction is not successful. Please therefore send one copy of the Gitopanisad MSS as instructed above. Let me begin the printing immediately as we have waited so much time. I am now fit to return back but I shall be glad to return with permanent Visa. I am going to Calcutta to visit Lord Caitanya's birthplace and next letter may be addressed

C/o __Madan Dutta, 76 Durgacharan Doctor Road, Calcutta-14__

If you have collected the contribution from different centers, you can pay Acyutananda's mother $88.00. This amount was taken from him on a/c of Kirtanananda's ticket. Kirtanananda should return to you $20.00 which he took from me on the plea of stopping at London. I am feeling too much for his disobedience. ACB
