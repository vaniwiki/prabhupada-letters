My dear Revatinandana Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 17, 1975 and have noted the contents. You are happy because you are chanting, dancing, reading Srimad-Bhagavatam and all the books. If you do these things regularly, then your life is a success. I am glad that things are going on better there. For lecturing, any one of our members can speak. Simply one has to memorize the purports and then speak in one's own language. Anyone who chants and follows the rules and regulations, where is there room for anxiety for him? You are an old, experienced devotee; so you behave like this and teach others to do so wherever you may stay.

You can preach independently as you have suggested, but do not deviate from our principles. You can start out small and then increase it if is successful. I want our men to go town to town village to village to preach Krishna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
