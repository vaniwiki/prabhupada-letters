My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated June 23, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. You idea of going to Columbus for the weekdays and to New Vrindaban for the weekends is very nice, so you may do this. I have just left New Vrindaban on June 23rd, and I think you will be a great asset to the construction projects that will be going on there. Similarly, in Columbus there is much interest in our movement, and as they also are in need of more brahmacaris, your presence there will be very encouraging. So you may execute this plan as soon as possible. I thank you very much for the nice sentiments you have expressed in your letter, and if continue to develop such feelings and engage all of your energy in the service of the Lord, then surely you will come out successful in perfecting your life in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
