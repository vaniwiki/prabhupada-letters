My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 20th, 1971.

The reports of your activities are most encouraging. From all over the Society, I am getting similar reports. People are very eager for Krishna consciousness. Especially the youth of the world are taking very serious interest, because they are not at all satisfied with the standards of happiness their parents have accepted. Neither their teachers, parents, nor anyone can offer them the solution to what this human form of life is meant for. So we have got a great responsibility to distribute this knowledge of Bhagavata Dharma to the whole world. If we remain very sincere and pure in following the line laid down by the previous great acaryas, this Krishna Consciousness Movement will undoubtedly be accepted throughout the world as the only religion. This has already been foretold in one newspaper here by a Japanese philosopher who has predicted that our Krishna Consciousness Movement will become the world religion by 1981.

You should always think of new outlets for distributing my books. The book distribution totals you have shown for Toronto Temple are very encouraging, so continue to improve and increase on the distribution.

Krishna Consciousness has got scope to be preached everywhere. Just now two boys are leaving to go to Red China and three other students are leaving for New Zealand to open a center there. Brahmananda is doing very well in Africa and most likely Rsi Kumar will join him and be deputed to open a center in South Africa. So we have got a great mission, we should be very vigilant that the strong foundation remain solid. Encourage all the boys and girls to adhere to the regulative principles and chant daily at least sixteen rounds. And as much as possible all of my students should become very well versed in all the philosophy presented in our books.

Please offer my blessings to all of my beloved disciples at ISKCON Toronto. I hope this finds you all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
