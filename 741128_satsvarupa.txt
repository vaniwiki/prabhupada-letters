My dear Satsvarupa das Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 20, 1974 from New York. I am very glad to hear of the continued success of the Library distribution program. You know it that I also was selling my books in this way to the schools and colleges and libraries. I would write, then publish, and then distribute without any help. So how much pleased I am with you that you are helping me in this mission. So you go on with your work. Krishna will help you. You are sincere in your purpose. This is very important engagement of visiting the professors, and the colleges and libraries, and getting the standing orders. This is the most important engagement. Do not doubt this.

It is also good that you are trying for the teaching course. What do the others know. Yes, simply they have written nonsense books. There in America is very good field. Regarding Franklin and Marshall College that was a misunderstanding. I am prepared to take the class. So you write the professor. You had told me it was very cold there, otherwise I was ready.

It is very good that the New York temple life is now much improved. What is very pleasing to me is that they have confronted the nonsense. They are sound devotees, otherwise they would have been carried away by this wrong propaganda.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
