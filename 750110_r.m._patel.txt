My dear Sri R. M. Patel

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your check for the amount of 200 dollars. Thank you very much for this kind offering. I hope by now you have been to our center in Montreal. If not, you are cordially invited at any time to visit there and take prasadam and associate with devotees. The address is: ISKCON, 1626 PIE IX Blvd., H1V 2C5.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
