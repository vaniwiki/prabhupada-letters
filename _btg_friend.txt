My dear friend,

Please accept my hearty greetings. I beg to inform you that a few copies of the "BACK TO GODHEAD" papers including the current and latest one are dispatched herewith to your address, and I shall request you to go through them with attention.

This paper is devoted to the cause of saving the human being from becoming an animal again. The unrest of the world is not created by God, but it is so done by the misgiven mind of the sensuous man. __You cannot bring in peace and prosperity simply by material activities__. You have to attain to the standard position of real life. The reality of life does not depend on the temporary body and the flickering mind, but it is transcendental to all such material conceptions.

You have to realize, therefore, the message of perfect life through your submissive aural reception and get it fixed up in your spiritual identity. __By doing so you shall be happy both in this as well as in the next life__. Please do not be carried away by the misgiven mind to conclude that the present life is all in all. You are eternal, and the present form of human life is a chance of realizing your eternal life. Do not spoil your life simply by serving the misgiven mind and the uncontrolled senses. __Please do not become your own enemy by your own self.__

"__Back to Godhead__" is a guaranteed literature to awaken your spiritual identity. It is essential and authorized. If you feel any doubt, please inquire from me, and I shall clear it up.,

Please therefore be a regular subscriber to this valuable magazine published fortnightly. The nominal subscription for one year is Rs. 2/4/- only including Indian postage.

And if you become a life subscriber by paying Rs. 51/- (fifty-one) at a time, you shall not only get the paper throughout the life without further payment __but also you will help me to attempt for a wider circulation of the paper throughout the world__. It is a mission of human welfare work, and I shall request you to extend your full co-operation. Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours in the service of the Lord,\\
Sd/- A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
