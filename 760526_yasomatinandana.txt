My dear Yasomatinandana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 23, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

I remember how so many people were coming to visit the temple. The Deities should be very beautifully decorated so that people will be able to see the gorgeous worship in the temple. Now you have also received shipment of books so distribute my books profusely. This distribution is the greatest welfare work for humanity. What will be the benefit of so many skyscraper buildings if in their next life they have to take birth as a cat or a dog? Where will be the advancement in such an arrangement? Actual progress is to become fit for going back to home, back to Godhead.

Concerning the incident where the two boys were killed in what appeared to be a bomb blast, it is unfortunate that the newspapers have made it appear that these boys are Hare Krishna devotees. Of course, anyone can chant Hare Krishna, just like we go on the streets chanting, and others will imitate us. However, in our aims you will not find that our organization is dedicated to such methods or goals. Our aim is to awaken people throughout the world to Krishna Consciousness, God consciousness, by chanting the Holy Names of God. We have published so many books to explain our viewpoint, and why we should sit idly by and allow the press to unfairly take advantage of such a situation to misrepresent the Hare Krishna Movement. In any case, the movement cannot be judged simply by the activities of some individuals, but these men were not in our camp and still the press took unfair notice of all the facts. We should demand at least equal time from the press to explain the entire situation clearly, and when necessary we should file suit against such newspapers in order that things are not distorted. It is not in our aims anywhere to build bombs for any purpose. The same mentality is involved in trying to blow-up a slaughterhouse as is there in meat-eating. Such things will not stop people from unnecessary animal slaughter. It is only by educating people in the science of Krishna Consciousness that they will automatically develop all good qualities. __Yasyatma bhaktir bhagavati akincana, sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah.__ And the nondevotee will not have any good qualities even they may be vegetarians. __Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad guna manorathenasati dhavato bahih__ [[books:sb:5:18:12|(SB 5.18.12)]]. So we should clearly establish our aims in such situations and sit by idly. We must preach very boldly whenever the situation is favorable.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
