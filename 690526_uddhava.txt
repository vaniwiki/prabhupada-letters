====== Letter to: Uddhava ======

My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated May 14, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. You have asked about where you will get the money for bookbinding equipment, and I think you may take it from the money you are saving. In Boston you told me the cost will be around $3,300, but why is it now $4,000? Anyway, the printing must be done first class, and with first class paper. Never mind it is $4,000. The important thing is it is done very nicely. The example will be our __TLC.__ For composing I think Rayarama has not given you the right time. It must be ready within one and a half months after the machine is there. By rough calculation, one can compose at least 10 pages per day, so for 400 pages it takes utmost 40-45 days. Anyway, I shall very soon give you the composed pages, so you may become serious for printing work. And you shall be in charge of these printing matters.

So far as binding is concerned, if we have to make the binding work outside, then we will have to pay more charges, so you can take quotation what will be the cost of binding __10,000__ books exactly on the same pattern as __TLC.__ If you think instead of binding yourself you may earn the money for it being done outside, that is also nice proposal.

Regarding your marriage, if Lilasukha is ready, then any day you can come here with her, and I shall perform the function immediately. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
