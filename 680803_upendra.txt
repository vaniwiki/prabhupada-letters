My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to receive your letter suggesting a branch in Vancouver, and it is very encouraging. Please negotiate with your friends as soon as this postal strike is over, and if there is a suitable place to open a center, I am agreed to this proposal. In the meantime, Hansadutta is coming and I shall consult with him also, and if possible we will go to Vancouver. Regarding Gargamuni's proposal: I am writing him separately and you will know the result from him. If Gargamuni's business is going in San Francisco nicely, he should not for the time being divert his attention. There are two friends also known to me, in Vancouver, and I have written them letters but I have not received any reply from them, probably due to the postal strike. Anyway, I am anxious to open a branch in Vancouver, and as soon as there is favorable circumstances, either through you or through any other friend, it will be a great pleasure for me to open a branch there. I hope all is well in San Francisco, and you are feeling in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Please locate and send to New York, the following medicines: Triphala-(brownish powder, appears like earth, and with faint sweet odor.) Baraillaich-(ground up nuts, very pungent odor---you ground up such nuts in S.F., after they were sent from Acyutananda in India.)*
