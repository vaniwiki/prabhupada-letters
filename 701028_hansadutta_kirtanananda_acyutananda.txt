Calcutta

My dear Hansadutta, Kirtanananda and Acyutananda Maharajas,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much sorry that since I have come to Bombay leaving Calcutta I did not receive any letter from you. I hope everything is going nicely there. I do not know also how many life members have been created since my departure for Bombay.

I was informed by Tamala from Bombay that the Hamilton House at Dalhousie Square is available for purchase. If it is so, immediately all of you see the house how far it is suitable for our purposes.

So far the terms of purchase is concerned, we shall accept any reasonable price provide the place is better suitable than Mr. Jaju's place.

Enclosed herewith please find the copy of the letter addressed to Mr. Jaju and immediately see him and do the needful. I am very much anxious to have a center in Calcutta, so both those places are very suitable for our purpose. Now you have to decide which one we shall take and work for it immediately.

I am returning to Bombay from Amritsar on the 30th October 1970, and the reply may be sent to the same address c/o Kailash Seksaria.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
