My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated August 31st, 1970, and I have duly noted the contents.

Regarding your opening a branch in Hong Kong, I have got all my blessings upon you. Do it immediately. So far your remaining on the Governing Body Commission, I do not think that is a great burden. Do your best to serve in the Commission by correspondence, but I prefer to see you a great preacher and if possible you may be relieved from the responsibility of remaining a member of the Governing Body Commission.

You have already opened up several branches like Tokyo and Sydney, so please continue this opening of centers as many as possible in Fiji, Melbourne, etc. While we were coming through the Philippines on the way to Calcutta from Tokyo we learned that in Manila they are also interested in our Movement for Krsna Consciousness, so that is another open field.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
