Delhi

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have safely reached Bombay and there was a nice reception. I am now staying at Chembur at the above address. I hope everything is progressing well with you in Delhi. Please let me know how things are going on there.

I am enclosing herewith one letter from Atma Ram and Sons, Booksellers; please take it with you to see them and show them our books and literatures and make some arrangement for their taking some of them for distribution.

When you inform me what is your estimation of Delhi and how people are reacting to our Movement, I shall instruct you how to proceed.

Hope this will meet you in good health. Please offer my blessings to Srimati Yamuna Devi and all the other devotees. Enclosed also please find one letter for Sriman Bruce.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
