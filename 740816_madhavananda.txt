My dear Madhavananda Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram dated August 14, 1974 and am very glad to learn that you had a very successful Janmastami celebration. This is Krishna's special mercy upon you. I think our next big upcoming project will be in London. You are a fortunate boy, both you and your wife. Wherever you go, you are successful in your devotional service. So I am looking forward to ever-growing success there in London. The Indians there are now coming to realize that they have been simply cheated by all the rascal swamis and yogis. So you must be sincere, always strictly following the principles and work with determination and patience. The secret of success in spiritual life is to please your spiritual master. Then, and only then can you be sure that Krsna is pleased.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
