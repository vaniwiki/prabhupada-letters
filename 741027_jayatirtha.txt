My dear Jayatirtha das:

Please accept my blessings. I understand from Bhavananda and Jayapataka that you have agreed to give Dollars 8,000.00 from BBT funds for construction of the second story of the Kitchen here. So, you can do this. The money may be sent to Gargamuni Swami in Calcutta, and he will forward here.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
