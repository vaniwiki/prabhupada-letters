Dear Sir:

Re: My S/B Account No. 29/12802 with you Through M. M. De

Kindly refer to my letter dated 3 March, 1970.

It is understood that the transfer of Rs. 5000 to the savings account No. 8/16578 with the United Bank of India Ltd., 157/B Dharmatalla Street, Calcutta-13, in favor of M. M. De, is under process of being sanctioned by the Reserve Bank.

Please transfer at least Rs. 1000 to the above account without delay, pending the Reserve Bank's sanction. And after being sanctioned, you can transfer the balance of Rs. 4000.

Thanking you in anticipation, and oblige.

Yours sincerely,\\

My dear Buro,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14 March, 1970, and noted the contents. I have not received any of your letter dated 13 March, 1970. When I receive that letter also, then I shall reply in detail. In the meantime, you can take this letter to the banks, and do the needful.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
