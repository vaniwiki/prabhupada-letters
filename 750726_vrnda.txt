Dear Vrnda devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter, undated. Regarding the booklet, "A Guide to the Care of Srimate Tulasi devi," yes, the book is very nice. It is approved. But one thing is that no sprays can be used, not at all. Tulasi is a worshipable plant so there is no question of using any sprays. The best thing is to simply daily water tulasi devi and keep her clean. Nothing else is required.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
