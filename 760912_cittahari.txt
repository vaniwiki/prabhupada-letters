====== Letter to: Cittahari ======

Auckland, New Zealand

My dear Cittahari das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 23, 1976 and have noted the contents.

On your recommendation I am accepting Usapati das for brahminical initiation and Kedara dasa shall be the spiritual name for Bhakta Kevin. Please hold a fire sacrifice and present the name at that time. Your local GBC man may chant on the beads. The tape of the gayatri mantra may be played and heard through the right ear. To be a brahmana means that one is clean inside and out by chanting the maha mantra and bathing regularly. All our initiates must chant at least 16 rounds a day and follow very strictly the regulative principles. This will give one spiritual strength.

Regarding the $30,000.00 which you will receive, you may deposit it in the Bank of America, Main Office, Los Angeles California, in the ISKCON Mayapur Vrndavana Fund. If you forward the amount to Ramesvara Maharaja there he will be able to deposit it for you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
