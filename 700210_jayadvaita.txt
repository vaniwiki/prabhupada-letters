My dear Jayadvaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 5 February, 1970. It is very much encouraging to see you are a good and scrutinizing editor. May Krishna bless you.

So far the vyabhicary symptoms are concerned, just now it is not possible to give you the two points missing because the reference books are left in London. So without waiting further for these minor discrepancies, you can finish the subject adding "etc." or do it at your best discretion as Krsna will dictate from within you. I can rely on you.

Another point is I want to prepare a small pamphlet for __Krsna__ book, giving the description in nutshell with some important pictures. Can you prepare it in consultation with Satsvarupa, immediately? This is required very urgently. Add on the cover page the following words:

Krsna The Supreme rich, powerful, famous, and beautiful Personality of Godhead without any material attachment is now available in book form (400 pages reading matter and 52 colorful illustrations) in first-class hardbound and woodfree paper printed. Those who have heard the "Hare Krishna Mantra" record as well as "Govindam" will do well by procuring this deluxe book and keep at home as a great treasure.

Try to understand the basic principles of the great movement "Krishna Consciousness"

I have already advised Gargamuni to talk with Brahmananda and again I am giving you in writing that the __Krsna__ book, manuscript and pictures, may be submitted to Dai Nippon positively on 15 February.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Handwritten note: Yaduvaraparisat. Thank you for your devoted work. Continue your prescribed duty and train others.
