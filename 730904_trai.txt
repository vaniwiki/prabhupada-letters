My dear Trai,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 30, 1973.

The two boys are gladly accepted by me on your recommendation, their names are as follows.\\
Ronald- Kamalasana Das and Peter - Prthusrava Das. Please give them good instructions regarding our Krishna consciousness philosophy and hold a fire ceremony and distribute nice Prasadm\\
to all the devotees.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
