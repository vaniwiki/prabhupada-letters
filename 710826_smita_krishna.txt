26th August, 1971

My dear Smita Krishna Das (Filip Asteman),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter dated 24th August*, 1971 and have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. Your spiritual name is Smita Krishna Das Brahmachary. Smita Krishna means Krsna who is smiling. Your beads are also duly chanted on by me and they are enclosed herewith.

I can understand from your letter that you are a very sincere boy and are hankering to make advancement in Krishna Consciousness. These are first class qualifications and if you will continue in this way with enthusiasm and determination your rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness will be certain. Follow the regulative principles strictly, chant your 16 rounds of beads faithfully, read and study our literatures and go for street San Kirtan as far as possible. In this way engage yourself in Krishna’s business 24 hours and your life will become perfect.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
