Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Mr. Punja:

Please accept my best wishes. I wish to inform you that I am sending one of my elder sannyasi disciples to Fiji for preaching and opening a Krishna consciousness temple there. Three other men will also go there to assist him. His name is His Holiness Subaladas Swami. Please see that he is taken care of there. He will be arriving within one months time.

I hope this meets you well.

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
