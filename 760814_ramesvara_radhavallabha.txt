My dear Ramesvara Maharaja and Radhavallabha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the package from Los Angeles containing the Vyasa Puja and the latest BBT newsletter and I have found both to be extremely pleasing.

The report of the book printing is both encouraging and surprising. Every time I see this I remember the words of my Guru Maharaja when he told me that wherever there was money it should be used to print books, not that we shall have big big temples and then fight in the court. He asked me to do this and I am trying my little bit, that's all. It is all by his blessings for without his blessings this wonderful thing would not have happened. He said personally to me, "If I could sell this Gaudiya Matha building, that would have been better." He predicted that there would be fire within these walls. So I took it, "O, His Divine Grace wants some books." So I accepted it, "Yes, I shall do it." It is all by his blessings. __Mukam karoti vacalam pangum langhayate girim,__ by his mercy a dumb man can speak and a lame man can cross a mountain.

Regarding the return of Indrapramada to the press, thank him for coming back. Krsna is so kind that anyone who does some service for Him, Krsna immediately captures him. __Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat,__ a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear. There are many instances. __Tyaktva sva-dharman caranambujam harer bhajan na pakvo'tha patet tato yadi...__ [[books:sb:1:5:17|(SB 1.5.17)]] "If someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in Krsna consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And if one performs his material activities perfectly, what gain is there?" So let us try to render service to Krsna very sincerely. Even a drop will never go in vain, __nitya.__ In this connection Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's prayer, __ayi nanda tanuja kinkarama patitam mam__ . . . is very instructive. Let us remain in that attitude and Krsna will give us protection.

I have received the photocopy of the August transfer to Bank of America, Bombay. I think that the reprinted books should have a list of the numbers on the first page. The totals listed will be very good publicity.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
