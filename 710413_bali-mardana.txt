My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3rd March, 1971 and have noted the contents. I have received one letter from Air India and they are prepared to give the tickets for going to Sydney. But your assistant in Sydney writes that he cannot spare the money for other passengers. So I am prepared to go alone. But you are not in Sydney, so how can I go there at this time? Also, what is the position of the temple to be donated in Kuala Lumpur? If you so desire I am prepared to go to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur, stay for one week and come back. The summary is that because you are not in Sydney, I am hesitant to go there. So please give me your instructions what to do.

I am so glad to note how nicely you are distributing KRSNA book. Thank you very much. We have got now 10,000 KRSNA book, Vol. one, third edition, already printed in Japan and sent to L.A. and they should be reaching there within the week.

Hoping to hear from you soon.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
