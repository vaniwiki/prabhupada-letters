My dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th November, 1970 along with very nice newspaper clippings.

Wherever we may be, if we are engaged in Krishna's service, that is our success. Bhaktivinode Thakura sung, praying to the Lord, that he would prefer to take His birth as an ant in the house of a devotee than to take birth as powerful as Brahma without any devotional service. The conclusion is that in any condition of life we can become happy if we are engaged in devotional service. Srila Rupa Goswami has said that a person whose desire is to always serve the Lord is always liberated, in any circumstance of life. So I am very glad that you are trying to organize a center in Florida which was our long-standing ambition and I understand also that you are gradually getting good response because they are gathering to an extent of 100 persons every weekend. So the future appears to be very hopeful.

Maya is very strong and she can victimize anyone of us at any moment. We shall therefore always keep ourselves vigilant and this is only possible by rigid engagement in Krishna's service. Certainly maya attacked you a few months ago and now again you are determined to serve Krishna; that will keep you secure. I shall always pray to Krishna for your protection. Side by side you also remain always engaged in Krishna's service and thus there will be no chance of falldown. I think your program is going on nicely. You also follow the regulative principles, chant 16 rounds, and keep yourself engaged in the service of the Lord. Also keep me informed occasionally about your activities.

Here in Bombay we are getting good response. Our expenditure is very heavy because Bombay is like a European or American city. But Krishna is providing us with all facilities. It requires a little intelligence how to keep pace with Krishna and the world simultaneously.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
