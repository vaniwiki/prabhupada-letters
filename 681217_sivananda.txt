My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received your letter dated December 14, 1968 and I have noted the contents with some surprise.

You have written that you will soon be leaving Hamburg and this news has caused me some distress. I have always been glad that you were in Germany to take care of the temple and you have written that Krishna Das is also disturbed at this sudden turn. From your letter it is unclear as to where you are going, to Montreal, to New Vrindaban, to work for your mother, it is all unclear as to your plan. I think that you must stay in our Hamburg center until you write to me why you are leaving Germany, and where you are expecting to stay. It could be that you are experiencing some difficulty in Germany, in which case please inform me of the same so we may solve the problem. You mentioned that leaving is the best thing for your devotional service, but you should know that without the instructions of the Spiritual Master that there is no question of devotional service. So I think that you must remain in the Hamburg center until I advise you further. I am anxiously awaiting to hear your reply. I hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
