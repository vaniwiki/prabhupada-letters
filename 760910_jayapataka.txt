My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. This is to introduce Sri Radha Pada das Adhikari. He is a family man and an electrician. He wants to join with us wholeheartedly with all family members. Please talk with him personally and do the needful.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
