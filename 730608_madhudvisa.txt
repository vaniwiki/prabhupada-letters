My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 23, 1973 and have noted the contents.

So you may drop the matter of the house in Malaysia.

Regarding Hrsikesa das, he is coming here to Mayapur on the 12th of this month and I shall discuss with him at that time what shall be his engagement.

I am very pleased with the book distribution that you are doing there, and I was especially glad to know that 160 Srimad-Bhagavatams were distributed in Melbourne alone last Friday. There is good potency, please try further.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
