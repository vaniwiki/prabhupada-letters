My dear Paramananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of November 2, 1971, and I am pleased that you have returned to New Vrindaban to develop it nicely. I wanted from the beginning that schoolhouse for teaching our children Krishna Consciousness. Now it seems that Krishna has fulfilled our desire and that Mr. Coffield may now sell it to us. Purchase it immediately and we shall construct there a model school for molding children in the perfect way of life. I know that you are the fit person for carrying out his plan, so I am entrusting you to see that everything is done very nicely and up to standard. This project of opening a school for young children may be expanded to include inviting children of respectable families for some tuition fee to come there for an ideal education including the basic requirements of reading and writing, but giving them also real spiritual knowledge of how to live perfectly---what other school of learning can offer such wonderful educational opportunity? There has also been suggestion of a kind of summer camp for children from crowded cities. What do you think?

I am pleased to note the birth of your second son. Now kindly deliver him to Krishna and your life will be perfect. Actually, you are an ideal householder couple, and I want that such grhastha couples should manage things as they have a tendency to organize and manage, and so I am confident that you will help me deliver these children back to Home, back to Godhead. Yes, you may call your son Madhavendra das.

I hope this meets you and your good wife Satyabhama in strong health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
