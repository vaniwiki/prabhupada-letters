====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

Dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received the names of the devotees recommended by you for first initiation, and upon your word I have accepted them as my disciples. There new spiritual names are as follows.

Francine Steinberg---Rangini devi

Jenny Gilbert---Jagatkirti devi

Danielle Mary---Dandakesa devi

Maureene Remila---Mandahasa devi

You may chant on their beads and hold a fire yajna in the temple. As GBC you must see that they and all the devotees in the temples are first of all chanting at least 16 rounds on beads. Be sure they are aware of the ten offenses to chanting, and that they remain enthusiastic about improving their devotional service in that way.

I have accepted for second initiation Sakirta das and Dayamrgya das and have enclosed sacred threads and gayatri mantra. Have them hear the tape of me saying the mantra through the right ear.

I will be eager to hear regular reporting from you on activities in your zone, which you may send to me at my Bombay address.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
