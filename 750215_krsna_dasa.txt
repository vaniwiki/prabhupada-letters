My dear Krsna dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. You are very fortunate to be attending the Gurukula school. You please take advantage of it and become a pure devotee of Lord Krishna. I would like to come there very much and see all of my sons and daughters there. I will be coming sometime soon, maybe next time I come back to USA after the Mayapur and Vrndavana festivals. Be very careful to follow all of the regulative principles nicely and chant 16 rounds and study my books very deeply. This will make you able to go back to Godhead at the end of your life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
