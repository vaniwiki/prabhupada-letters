San Francisco

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of the 9th May as well as Srimati Janaki's letter of the same date. Please convey my blessings for her and all the boys and girls in San Francisco. Since I have come to New York I have not heard anything from Jayananda Das Brahmacari (Jim). Is he regularly attending meetings. I shall be glad to hear from him. The gentleman who wrote on Meditation is Dr. Haridasa Chowdhury. You can find his name from the telephone directory.

The devotees of the temple must keep themselves engaged otherwise they cannot make progress in Krishna consciousness. The __maya__ is very strong and as soon as there is opportunity the Maya will come and attack. Therefore every one should be very careful against the attack of Maya. And the only effective defense is remain Krishna consciousness always.

If you can prepare cymbals surely there will be good demand for it. There are many customers here already demanding it. Gargamuni is supplying them small finger cymbals and they are accepting it.

So far questions on spiritual realization and doubts in the study of the Bhagavad-gita or Srimad-Bhagavatam may be placed before me and I shall try to solve them to my best knowledge.

Regarding publication of the Bhagavad-gita the quotations so far received are 11000 to 13000 thousand dollars. I have got about 6000 thousand dollars and I am eager to have the balance from any other source. The profit derived from record selling may be given to this fund. Gargamuni is paying me in that way. I wish that you may also follow the same principle.

Any sitar player or tabla player or any other musician invited in the temple cannot play anything except Hare Krishna. Neither any one can utilize the temple for some musical demonstration. Such things are items for sense gratification. If somebody comes in the temple to chant Hare Krishna by his musical talents he is welcome otherwise not. Please follow this principle.

Here also new youngsters are coming more and more to take interest Krishna consciousness. We require a bigger place but I do not know how Krishna will help us. There is a very nice building in this area and we are negotiating but do not know what is Krishna's plan. Hope you are all well.

Yours ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Nandarani has sent a letter to Brahmananda asking back her Typewriter. Did you not ask her when I wanted to exchange with mine?\\
N.B. I have received Balabhadra & expecting Subhadra. In Montreal they are preparing there order so you may not prepare for Montreal but if possible make for Los Angeles.
