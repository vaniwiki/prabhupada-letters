My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 24, 1973 with enclosed daksina check for $200.00, for which I thank you very much. Yes, I will come for the ground breaking ceremony because it is special event. So you please send tickets for four of us to come.

Regarding the initiations, enclosed are four mantra sheets and one sacred thread chanted on by me for the four brahmanas, and I am pleased to accept the following as my initiated disciples: Sarvesvari dasi (Shelly); Gunyarupini Dasi (Ginny); Gomata Dasi (Gale); Vajresvari Dasi (Elly); Lajjavati Dasi (Lynn); Isvara Das (Mark). So you perform the fire yajna for the brahmanas and let them hear the Gayatri Mantra from the tape which I have recorded into their right ear, and you may chant upon the beads for the first initiates.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher;\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
