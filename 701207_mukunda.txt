My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your detailed letters (2) dated November 28th, 1970, with regard to the Regent Park land.

We sent you a telegram to send the certified copy of our constitution and you also confirmed by telegram, but it is not received yet.

So far the Regent Park land scheme is concerned, I have read over all your points and further talks on these may be discussed on receipt of the above mentioned documents. It is not practical proposal to request Sri Rirlaji to write to the High Commissioner. Another thing, you do not rely on Proful Patel---you find out your own place. When I was in London, this Proful Patel promised to see me many times, but he did not come.

Regarding telephone at Seksaria House or anywhere else, don't try to use telephone unnecessarily.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Srimati Janaki devi. I hope you are both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P. S. Please arrange to send all my book-sales proceeds directly to Dai Nippon Printing Co. Tokyo and let me know.\\
