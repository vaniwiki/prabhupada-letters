My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th September, 1973, I am very glad that within the month of September you have dispatched over $10,000. to the Book Fund. So London Temple is debtor about $50,000. So if you continue with enthusiasm like this within three or four months you can liquidate the amount. This will be a great credit for you.

Syamasundara came here on his way to Hyderabad. I have not heard anything from him since he left over one week ago. I do not know what is actually happening about his business. But my rough calculation is that he still owes about $20,000 to the Society's funds. Unless he pays it back as soon as possible, I cannot expect his business to be very profitable. Therefore I have always asked him to stop this business. He says he will stop he does not do so. So many proposed contracts failed, so how he is still hoping to make some profit for this business I do not know.

Anyway, now you have taken charge of the management as President. So do it nicely and send me reports regularly. So far I am very pleased with how things are going.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
