My dear Aksayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 1-4-77 and I have noted the contents.

I have received the advices from both the Punjab National Bank and Syndicate Bank.

As you have requested for the time being Vishambarji may stay for helping with the Gurukula construction. I know he is very much expert.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
