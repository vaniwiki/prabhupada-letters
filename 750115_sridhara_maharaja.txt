Navadvipa

My dear Sripada Sridhara Maharaja,

Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet. I beg to inform you that I have arranged for the opening of the temple in Vrndavana on Sri Ram Navami day by the 20th of April 1975. Perhaps you know it that the ceremony was to take place on last Janmastami, but as the temple was not finished at that time, it could not be. Therefore, it was postponed. I wish to know whether your Holiness will kindly participate in this ceremony during that time to install the deity properly according to the Hari-bhakti-Vilasa regulations.

His Excellency, the Governor of Uttar Pradesh has kindly consented to join us during the ceremony.

So, I shall be very glad to hear from you in this respect by return post.

I am obliging.

I hope this meets you in good health and thanking you in anticipation for an early reply.

Yours obediently,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami\\
