ISKCON – New Delhi

Sri Mayapur Chandradoya Mandir,\\
P.O. Sreedham Mayapur,\\
Dist. Nadia, West Bengal.

Dear Bhagavat Ashraya Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7th February, 1977 and have noted the contents.

I am very glad to learn of the improvements you are making in our Delhi center. It is very good that local Indian residents are coming to the evening program. Regarding the man who wants initiation, your idea to recommend him is nice when he increases his chanting to sixteen rounds and regularly attends the morning and evening programs.

Regarding the two boys who are attempting to develop book distribution program, that is very nice. Distribute books as many as possible. Now we have new Hindi books – Easy Journey to Other Planets, Perfection of Yoga, Srimad Bhagavatam, etc. For your temple programs you should read from Bhagavatam and explain, and then someone should explain in Hindi. Prasadam must also be given. Whatever you can give, but something must be there. On the whole I am very much pleased by your program. Kindly continue.

I am very glad that Tejyas is there. His cooperation will be very much helpful for the collection, He knows this thing.

Yes, that will be very nice if we introduce Rathayatra in Delhi. People will automatically take part. I thank you for your invitation to visit you and yes, certainly I will come.

Regarding renting the other part of the house, yes, refer to Tejyas and do the needful. If by rent or purchase we can take that place, that will be very nice. You appear to be intelligent boy, so if you can negotiate with the landlord and make some bargain then we can accept. The landlord is little devotee. I know that. So if we take both parts of the house he can reduce. I think you are paying rent Rs. 2500/- per month. So total rent would be Rs. 5000/- per month and per year total rent is Rs. 60,000/-. So to get this amount we would have to invest Rs. 6 Lacs in fixed deposit at 10% interest which would amount to Rs. 60,000/- a year. For purchasing he wants between Rs. 8 and 10 lacs, so from business point of view it would be better to rent and there will be no botheration. But if we rent there must be agreement that we cannot get kicked out. We need some permanent arrangement in Delhi, people are coming both local and foreigners. The situation is nice and it is important to take this house. It is disturbing to have another tenant. They were playing the radio and disturbing me in my room.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
