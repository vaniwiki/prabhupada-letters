My dear Bhavananda:

Please accept my blessings. Since leaving India more than one month I have not received any report of the Mayapur project, how it is going on. So I may request you to write me in this regard. I want that the building must be completely finished before my next return. So please tell me what is the position there.

I have requested men to come there to Mayapur. They will bring paintings for decorating the building especially the temple hall. Please see also that they get trained up nicely in making the dolls and the mrdangas. I want to solve these two problems. We will want these dolls in London and other places, so please do the needful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please be kind enough to send me a report at least fortnightly\\
