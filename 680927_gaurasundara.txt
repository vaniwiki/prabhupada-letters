My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I was very much anxious to hear from you, and I am so glad to receive your letter dated Sept. 24, 1968, and it is very encouraging. It is by Krishna's Grace that you have gotten a job as desk clerk. This is another good news. Please continue in that job and try to organize a center in Hawaii, whose description appears to be very attractive like India. The description you have given is exactly corresponding to the eastern and western coast of India. I think Mahapurusa will join you very soon. And Murari is also arranging to go there, so you will get the cooperation and help of your God-brothers, and you are also situated in a job, and when Govinda dasi goes there, I think she can also have a nice job. So, combined together, you will be able to develop a very nice center, perhaps our own temple of Radha Krishna in that good spot, which is very attractive for me at least.

Regarding the mrdanga: You should make a statement to the authority that they did not allow you to take it with you, and forced you to keep it with the baggage, although it was known that there was every chance of it being broken. And at last they have broken it---so they must pay $200.00 damages. Claim it, and we shall fight with these nonsense people. I do not know in future how we can take mrdanga there. Is there any marine shipping service from San Francisco or from India to there?

Please keep me informed of your activities there, and I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am feeling your separation but that does not matter we must do our duty in Krishna Consciousness.
