My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 2nd, 1970 and accordingly I have issued one letter to Mr. Allen Klein, the copy of which is enclosed herewith, please find. I have advised Brahmananda to see him. I am so glad to learn that Sriman George is making good advancement in Krishna consciousness. He is a good soul and I am praying for him to Krishna, so surely he will make advancement. His book, __Krishna,__ is already ready for being sent to the press. Please let me know if I shall send the manuscript to the press or I shall await further instruction from you. Now I am in Los Angeles and you can contact me here after consulting George. I am very glad to learn that London Temple as well as the householder devotees are all doing well. I have received letter from you and Mukunda also, but I have received no letter from Tamala. Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls and devotees in London Temple.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
