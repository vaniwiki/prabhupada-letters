My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22nd October, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far BGAII is concerned, if the price for Morocco binding is the same as that of hardcover, then we shall prefer hardback only along with the paper back. I suggested Morocco binding before because I thought it to be cheaper. But if it is not cheaper then we don't want Morocco binding.

So far Brahmananda Maharaja making direct payments to Dai Nippon, you should open correspondence with him in this connection. When I left Africa I advised him to send 15,000 shillings. Whether he has sent or not? So far KRISHNA books, paperback, certainly 25,000 can go there for distribution in Europe and U.S.A. Another point is that we can have our own records pressed; there are so many records to choose from.

The real purpose of these stamps is to make Radha-Krishna picture seen by so many people. Other pictures for other stamps can also be used. The cover picture for KRSNA book is nice for one. Some may even say "KRSNA book" as advertisement. So use your discretion. We want to advance our propaganda is all.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
