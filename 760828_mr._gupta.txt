Dear Mr. Gupta,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 24 August 1976 and have noted the contents.

You may come and see me after September 3rd in Vrndavana where we can discuss all these affairs. There is also a nice guest house there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
