Dear Atreya Rsi,

Please accept my blessings. Very suddenly Tamala Krsna Goswami underwent treatment for a surgical operation for a hernia. Now he is completely invalid and cannot move. It will take about two weeks more to recover, and then he desires to go to the U.S.A. for preaching work, and retire from the GBC.

We have discussed about you because immediately you have no portfolio. I am now in India, so in my presence another GBC may not be required, but if required in my absence, my question is whether it will be possible for you to take charge? Kindly guide me how it will be possible, while keeping you occupation intact.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
