My dear Pusta Krsna Maharaja;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 18, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. I am very pleased that you are preaching for preaching is our main line. Harikesa Swami was also doing preaching work and now you are also. Preaching is the most important business. Although my personal service is also important, the preaching work comes first. I want everyone of our men to become first class preachers. So you want to preach that is best. Don't be worried, but go on with your preaching and you will be happy.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
