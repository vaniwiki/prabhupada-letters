My Dear Girish,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for the beautiful ornaments that you have so kindly sent for my Deities. Immediately upon receipt of them I have placed these ornaments upon Sri Sri Radha Krishna, and they are looking very gorgeous. So your gift has been very successful, and surely Krishna will bless you for it. I understand from Kirtanananda Maharaj and Hayagriva that both Birbhadra and yourself are doing very well, and it engladdens me to hear this. Both of you are highly intelligent boys, and I expect that in the future you will both be great preachers of this Krishna Consciousness Movement.

Please offer my blessings to your teacher, Satyabhama Dasi, and to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I shall inform your mother about your gift and she will be happy.
