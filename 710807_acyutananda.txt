Mayapur

My dear Acyutananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 8th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am very glad that at least one cottage is set up in Mayapur in our own land so that when I go back again I shall be able to stay there at your care. Mayapur construction will be of grand scale and Tamala wishes that the 1 matter be given to a big contractor, but I think we should do the construction ourselves. Just like my Godbrothers have also constructed big big temples but did not appoint big contractors so far I know. If required I can send somebody expert in construction work to supervise the work there nicely. You are now acquainted with the local market. So I think that if we supervise the building construction work that will save great amount of money. You consider on these points and let me know your views by return mail.

Regarding your proposal of a Rathayatra festival as Bhaktivinode Thakura suggested, you may kindly send me a note telling in which book the above statement is there. I shall be very glad to see the article you have written in this connection and if it is ready please send it to me immediately.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
