My dear Subaladas Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 7, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am glad that you have arrived there on my order and have already begun the preaching. Krishna will supply everything to you, according to your capacity for preaching purely the message of Lord Caitanya. There I have found the Indians very cooperative for our movement, and you have had good experience in India preaching, so you are the right man to go there. You are sannyasi and the people will automatically respect you. So be ideal in behavior following strictly the rules and regulations. Now you are getting more men, so organize everything carefully, and inform me what is the progress.

Brahmananda Swami says that because of his experience in Africa, you should be careful in registering the Society. Yes, it must be in the name of ISKCON, with my name as Founder-Acarya. Check to see that only Fiji citizens can register the Society there, and if necessary you can have others as the officers.

I have already written you that I would like to come there when I return to USA in April, so please arrange for it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
