My dear Mr. DDD,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received your nice letter together with pictures drawn by you. Thank you very much. I am so happy to see how you are drawing the activities of Krsna and His devotees the Pandavas and Jagannatha das Babaji. And I am glad to see that your letters are drawn nicely also.

It is very encouraging to me that you are regularly chanting your twenty rounds of beads daily. Be careful never to decrease but increase the number and you will become more strong in Krsna Consciousness. So continue to tend your Deities first-class and be happy in Krsna's service.

I am very glad to know that you are learning your arithmetic in school, but I do not know if you are staying at New Vrindaban for study because your letter is sent from Montreal, Canada.

You have written that you are sending seventy dollars for my book fund, but I have not received the seventy dollars enclosed with your letter. Has it been sent by separate mail? Please let me know what has happened to it as soon as possible.

Always remember Krsna Who is your dearmost friend and always serve Him just to please Him, and He will give you all intelligence how to be a first-class devotee. Just try to learn all about Krsna, chant Hare Krsna, and you will be a great preacher of our Krsna Consciousness movement.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
