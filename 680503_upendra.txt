My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated April 27, 1968, and noted the contents. Your feelings of separation are very strong, and I thank you for your kind sentiments expressed therein.

So far the date of the Rathayatra festival, it is to be on the 28th of June, and will continue for 8 days. There are two festivals; one going, and one returning. So you can make plans like that.

Yes, if it is necessary then you can make a nice bed for Lord Jagannatha and Lord Balarama, and keep them nicely until I return. It is your responsibility to see to keeping all the things which I left there very nicely, so please see to it.

Among the medicines I left there you will find some small phials, with the name on them "Bhasker Bajra Jog". Please send me immediately by 1st day mail 4 phials entitled as above. Please see to it.

Please keep me with information so far the church is concerned, and try for it. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
