====== Letter to: Gurudasa ======

Stockholm

My dear Gurudasa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 24, 1976 and have noted the contents with pleasure. As far as your danda goes if it is too troublesome to carry there is no need for it. Lord Caitanya's danda was broken by Nityananda Prabhu and He never carried it again. But if you want you can make another although for preaching purposes it may be dropped.

I am very very pleased with your preaching in Poland and you should continue this program with full enthusiasm. Your coming to Vrndavana is not so important and it may wait. Please expand this program more and more for there is a very good and favorable field there. Try and start a center there, it seems possible. Continue this program of kirtana and prasadam for this will conquer their hearts as they have never experienced anything like it before. I know you are a sincere preacher and they will appreciate your good Vaisnava qualities. Please send me reports of your future successes. Thank you very much.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
