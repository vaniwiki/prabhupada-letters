My dear Vrikodara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram as follows, "Dearest Srila Prabhupada please accept my fallen obeisances I am requesting permission for second initiation for following boys RasaVilasa das brahmacari Janananatha das brahmacari they have both been chanting 16 rds daily without fail for 10 months and have taken their service very seriously your fallen servant Vrikodara das adhikary".

Upon your recommendation I will accept these boys for second initiation. Now, hold a fire ceremony for devotees only. Let them hear the tape of me chanting Gayatri mantra in their right ears. Teach them how to chant on their finger divisions.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
