My dear Meenakatan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 14, 1973 and I have noted the contents carefully.

Yes you may return to India I have no objection. We very much need workers in India, so if you go there that will be nice.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Regarding your Problem; you should know by now that if you break one of the four regulative principles then you cannot advance. Advancement is possible only by sincere chanting of the Holy Name. So what can I say, you chant and be determined not to engage in this sinful activity again. But there is no use in writing to me that you are doing something sinful and then you continue to do it on some plea. Stop sinful life and be Krishna Conscious, that's all.
