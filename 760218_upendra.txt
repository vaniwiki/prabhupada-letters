My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5 February, 1976.

It is nice to hear that your ministers visa is being processed. In the meantime you can just wait. You will be the right person to be in charge of the temple. Krishna is giving you time for being perfectly trained up.

If others are not listening, then better not cause disturbance, but inform the GBC. On any serious matter you should inform me directly.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
