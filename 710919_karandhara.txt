My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 12th September, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the $33,000.00 loan, I expect you should pay at least $5,000 per month. On this understanding the loan was made. Anyway try and pay at this rate so that in seven months the whole debt will be closed. I have kept this money for such emergency payment so kindly return it as soon as possible.

Regarding the MacMillan agreement, Brahmananda says that he left everything with Rupanuga when he left N.Y. So kindly inquire from him. So far I know the agreement was made that my royalty would be paid directly to the society. In the beginning they paid me $1,000. and later on I think I got another $600. Besides this I have never received any money from them. If they paid anything it may have been paid directly to N.Y. ISKCON. So you can inquire and do the needful.

Yes you should duly collect for Mayapur and I shall advise you when the time comes for utilizing the money. In the mean time go on collecting. I thank you very much for proposing to collect $100,000 for the Mayapur project.

What has happened to the Bhagavad-gita quotation? Mr. Ogata told me to wait due to the fluctuating monetary standard, but for how long? Without the quotation we cannot send the manuscript. So please inquire.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
