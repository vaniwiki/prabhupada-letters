My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 19, 1972. One thing is, I have just received on July 25, 1972, the following telegram from Mohanananda; "Obeisances I am not offended mismanaging book fund Madhudvisa Swami is responsible why must I receive blame against my wishes." I do not know what is the meaning of this telegram, therefore kindly send me the full explanation. It does not sound well that there is quarreling.

I am very glad to hear that there has been a very nice Rathayatra Festival in Melbourne, and that despite all obstacles many people joined and it was very successful. Similarly, in London we have already celebrated a very successful Rathayatra procession, and many thousands of persons joined in marching from Marble Arch to Trafalgar Square, and in Trafalgar Square I initiated nearly 30 new disciples and we had fire yajna and many, many thousands of persons observed it, mostly Englishmen.

Regarding the dramas, my point is not to deviate from gravity and compromise or distract from the situation. Keep this point in vision and continue. That is a very good proposal to stage one play based upon Lord Caitanya. Read TLC on the stage, just like Caitanya Mahaprabhu is giving instruction to Sanatana Goswami, and the actors may speak little philosophy, without need for special costumes or other things. Then kirtana. There must be always kirtana. Dialogue, kirtana; then again dialogue, again kirtana; again repeat; like that. No humor should be there, just philosophy and kirtana. If it is successful, then the same dialogue-kirtana may be followed by other sankirtana parties in Europe and America.

All blessings of Krishna upon you. You have done so nicely. Keep always in your vision that our movement is so great and keep gravity. You are experienced devotee. I can see things are going nicely.\\
Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
