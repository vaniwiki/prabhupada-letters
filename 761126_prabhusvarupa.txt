My dear Prabhusvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 23/11/76.

I am advising Jayapataka to advance Rs. 10,000 to be added to your balance of Rs. 5,000. The Rs. 15,000 may be deposited in the bank in ISKCON's name. Jayapataka, Bhavananda and yourself can be the signers. Any two may sign on the cheques.

Where is the site plan? Give me the length and breadth of the site. I can give it to Saurabha. He'll make a nice building plan.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
