====== Letter to: Sukadeva 1 ======

Dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 4, 1974 and I have examined the contents.

It is good news for me that our Seattle, Washington temple is growing under your able guidance, and I am much obliged to you. It would not be possible for me to preach all over the world except for your cooperation, you and your Godbrothers and sisters who are maintaining centers all over the world.

Your plan, therefore, to leave and take Vanaprastha is not advisable now. Better you remain there and go on with the preaching work, maintaining the devotees and approaching innocent persons. I think you have already a good preaching field there. After you are fifty years of age you can consider this move. Please consult with Karandhar who is GBC for your zone, in this matter.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
