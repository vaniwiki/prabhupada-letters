====== Letter to: Turyadas  ======

My dear Turyadas Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt your letter dated Feb.16, 1977.

Please continue to increase the deity worship and teach others to become a very good pujari like you. When I see my disciples doing deity worship nicely that engladdens me. 'Sevonmukhe hi jivadau/ svayam eva sphuraty adah', God realization is possible only by service. That is the only way. He is adhoksaja. 'Tesam satata-yuktanam bhajantam priti purvakam/ dadami\\
buddhi-yogam tam yena mam upayanti te', When one engages in devotional service, Krishna gives intelligence from within. Otherwise, how the unlimited can be served by the limited? So please continue to make the worship more and more beautiful.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
