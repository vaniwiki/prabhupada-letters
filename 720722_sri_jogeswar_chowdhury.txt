Sri Jogeswar Chowdhury\\
Chittagong, Bangladesh

My dear Sri Jogeswar Chowdhury,

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter addressed to the Secretary of our London branch, and I am very much pleased to note that you have somehow or other seen one copy of our "Back to Godhead" magazine and that you wish a copy of our __Teachings of Lord Caitanya.__ I have instructed the secretary here in London to forward you one copy immediately by ordinary mail, gratis. I am glad to inform you that a party of my disciples will be coming to Bangladesh soon for spreading the message of Lord Caitanya there. They will be stationed at Jessore, but will travel wherever they are invited and hold Sankirtana. So if you are very much eager to receive them, about six or eight of my foreign American and European disciples, you can invite them to Chittagong and they shall be happy to stay with you there and hold programs of kirtana and preaching.

Kindly do the needful and make all arrangements among the prominent Vaisnava citizens in Chittagong for programs and for the board and keep for the Hare Krishna party, and meanwhile I am forwarding a copy of your letter to the leader, Sriman Tamala Krishna das Goswami, and you may write to him also, c/o ISKCON World Headquarters, P.O. Sridhama Mayapur, Nadia district, West Bengal, India.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
