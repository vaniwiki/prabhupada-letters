Dear Sir:

Replying your kind letter dated 9th March, 1976, I am sending herewith the specimen of signature for the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust account for your records. I will be sending the document of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust through Sridhar Swami of which you can make a copy and keep the copy with you. This is the original document, the copy may be attested by you as “seen the original document.” That will serve the purpose.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enc: 1 specimen of signature.
