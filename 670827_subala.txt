My dear Subala das,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated 8/15, and pleased to read the contents. By Krishna's Grace you have gotten a nice old castle, and converted into a K.C. temple. I am also pleased to learn that people are taking an interest in the temple, and that you are getting some publicity started. K.C. is so that it will bring more and more, If you but go on chanting with heart and soul. It is Lord Caitanya's desire that you have opened this branch in such a distant place, and surely it will be a successful attempt. I have nothing to instruct you newly, but the same: simply chant in the beginning for 30-45 minutes then read something from the Gita or S. Bhagavatam, and then chant again in the usual way.

Please offer my blessings to Krishna devi dasi, Harsarani, Aniruddha das, Rasikananda das, and Jananivasa, and any others who may be with you. I am so pleased you have started this branch, as Kirtanananda did in Montreal. Please always keep the temple nicely cleansed, and put as many flowers as possible, burn candles and incense, offer fruits and nice food stuffs, chant and dance! If you would like some paintings, you can ask Jadurani in N.Y., and she will send you some.

I have already sent 3 mrdangas, and very soon will send more; and when they reach N.Y. you will get a mrdanga and a few pairs of kartel. Please keep in touch with you by your weekly reports.

So far my health is concerned, I am improving slowly, and I expect to return to you by the end of October next, as I too am missing you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
