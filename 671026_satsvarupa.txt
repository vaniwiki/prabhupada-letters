My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I have already duly received the invitation from Harvard University. It is understood that they are scheduling me for 20 Nov. between 6 and 10 PM. I can start immediately on the strength of my visitors visa, but I am waiting for Mukunda's reply who is trying for my permanent visa. Yesterday we have all come to Navadvipa. This place is another establishment of one of my Godbrothers. It is very nice and extensive place and my God-brother, B.R. Sridhara Maharaja has spared one entire nice house for my stay. He has also agreed to cooperate with our society. We shall observe his birthday ceremony tomorrow and the brahmacaris shall learn how to celebrate spiritual master's birthday. I hope to reach your state by the 20 of November. Hope you are well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
