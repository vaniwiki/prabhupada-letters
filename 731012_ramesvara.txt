My dear Ramesvara:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 19, 1973 forwarded to me from Japan. I am glad to hear of the book distribution success of Tripurari in Chicago. It is reported that he did it dressed in dhoti, but Karandhara says that dhoti is an impediment. So if he can distribute 105 Gitas and 105 Sri Isopanisad in one day in dhoti in Chicago, why not try for this in other places as well.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I also thank you for sending the copies of the letters of the people expressing their appreciation of our books. I am glad that these letters are being answered promptly by you. This is important.
