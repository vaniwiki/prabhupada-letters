My dear daughter,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 8, 1976, with enclosed guru-daksina and I thank you very much.

Simply follow the regular program of chanting 16 rounds of Hare Krishna Maha-mantra daily and abstain from illicit sex-life, meat-eating, gambling, and intoxication. In this way you will surely make rapid progress in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
