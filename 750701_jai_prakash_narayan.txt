Dear Sri Jai Prakash Narayanji,

Please accept my greetings. I am hearing from the newspapers that in India there is some upheaval on the ground of political activities. I have also heard that you are observing "fast" and it has given me some concern. I think that your goodness and Srimati Indira Gandhi are equally well wishers of India, but there is a difference of opinion only. Under the circumstances I would request you to give up this fasting. If you and Indira Gandhi sit down together, I can give you some suggestions on the basis of Sri Srimad Bhagavad Gita, and this will solve all of the problems of India.

Perhaps it is known to you that I am leading the Hare Krishna Movement all over the world. I am glad to inform you that the movement is appreciated by the thoughtful educated circles in the western countries. They are seriously reading my English translations of the Vedic instructions, and I think that if this movement is pushed forward, the whole world will be happy and it will glorify the prestige of India, which is considered to be the most holy place in the universe.

I am forwarding a copy of this letter to Srimati Indira Gandhi to take necessary action in this connection. I am always prepared to meet you both in this connection, and I hope that such a meeting will be a great epoch in the human society for changing the chaotic condition.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
