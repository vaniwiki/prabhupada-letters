My dear Jagannatham Prabhu,

Please accept my humble dandabats. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letter dated 1 February 1969. I have received one pamphlet of the Golden Jubilee, organized by Sripada Tirtha Maharaja, and a covering letter dated 29, January 1969. This letter was not even signed by Tirtha Maharaja, but appears to be a general circular letter with his rubber stamp only, without any signature. Besides that, there is not a single line inviting me to attend the ceremony either officially or personally. Aside from this, I have not received any invitation from him, and I do not know if the other Tridandi Sannyasis and disciples of Prabhupada have been specially invited or not. The copy of his letter along with the copy of my letter is enclosed herewith for your purusal. I have also sent to him one copy of my __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__

You have written to say that Tirtha Maharaja will give me all facilities to present before the audience during the Golden Jubilee function a picture of my "marvelous work that is being done in the USA and East European countries," but I do not think he has any intention to give me such facility because he has in his pamphlet presented one picture of Bon Maharaja's preaching work which is defunct for the last 40 years, but he has purposefully not mentioned even a single line about the preaching work now going on in Europe, Canada, and America under my direction. You will read a copy of my reply which will speak for itself.

Regarding your books, the editorial assistants and myself do agree there is no difference of our Sampradaya Siddhanta. Now we have only to see how these books will be sellable in this country. The best thing will be if you can kindly send more copies of each book, and we can try to sell them in our different centers. If there is good response, we can think of republishing them. Certainly to send the books by air mail is prohibitive, but you can send them by surface mail in different batches to our different centers of which a list of addresses is found in the copy of the letter addressed to Tirtha Maharaja. The next alternative is to pack up all of the books and send them to Calcutta to our shipping agents, namely; United Shipping Corporation, 14/2 Old China Bazar Street (Room #18), Calcutta-1, INDIA. Upon hearing from you I will advise them to take care of the packages to New York by sea-way. We shall try to sell the books in our different centers, and the sales proceeds will be kept separately. If the books are to be published, from here the sales proceeds will be utilized for this purpose. Or else, the proceeds shall be sent to you after a deduction of 40% discount as we get from others. We are selling books of many of our godbrothers, just like Bon Maharaja, Nitai dasa Brahmacari, Prof. Sannyal, Bhakti Pradip Tirtha, Raga Caitanya Prabhu, etc. I think this arrangement will be practical. If you will give us your permission then we can immediately arrange to publish some of the best portions as articles in __Back To Godhead__ with your good name therein.

My next book, __Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ shall be out by the end of March 1969. I have advised the printer to send you two dozen title covers to your Bombay address, and I wish that these covers may be kindly distributed by you to respectable guests who may participate in the Jubilee celebration.

You will read the letter addressed to Tirtha Maharaja, and you will meet him also by the 25th instant. If he agrees to give me a plot of land as requested in my letter than it will be a practical gesture of our full cooperation. If you can kindly help in this matter it will be a great service to Srila Prabhupada.

I thank you very much for your kind blessing, and I beg to remain

Yours ever affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
