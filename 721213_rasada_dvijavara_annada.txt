My dear Sons and Daughter,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated November 22, 1972, and upon the recommendation of Bhagavan I have gladly consented to accept you all as my duly initiated disciples. I have chanted on your beads and they are enclosed herewith. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Rick Joaquim/RASADA DAS

David/DVIJAVARA DAS

Anita/ANNADA DASI

Now please continue to strictly follow the regulative principles and rigidly observe the four principles restrictions as Bhagavan has taught you, and without fail always chant at least 16 rounds daily on your beads, and be happy.

If you stick to these principles with determination, you will be freed from all attachment to maya, by Krishna's grace. The example is that when the sun is in the sky then where is the question of darkness? Similarly, when Hare Krishna mantra is vibrating on your tongue, and you are hearing attentively, then your consciousness become clear or Krishna Consciousness, and there is no question of maya or hazy consciousness. Just as when the darkness and the light come together the darkness cannot stand before the light, so maya cannot remain in the presence of Krishna. Always remember therefore to chant Hare Krishna, and that will save you in all circumstances without any doubt.

Now I am enclosing also one sacred thread, duly chanted by me, along with copy of gayatri mantra. Bhagavandas will hold the fire yagna and give sacred thread to Sri Gopala. He may play the tape of me reciting gayatri mantra into his right ear and teach him to count on the finger divisions. The fire yagna can be held for all the four devotees.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
