My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two letters dated 24th June, 1971 and undated respectively, and have noted the contents.

I'm very sorry that you are separated from the temple for the time being. But don't worry. Krishna will save you, you can be sure. There is no doubt about it. So go on chanting Hare Krishna at all costs and never mind these tribulations of maya. Go on chanting Hare Krishna. Krishna is in your heart. Pray to Him for your protection and soon all things will be adjusted and you will again be in the association of devotees. Of that you can be sure.

Hoping this will meet you in rapidly recovering health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
