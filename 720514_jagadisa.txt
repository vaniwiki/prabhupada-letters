My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 8, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I am very much encouraged by your increase in literature distribution for Canada zone, and I can understand that you are very methodical and careful to keep proper accounts. That is very good qualification for manager. Now one thing, as you know we are thinking to re-distribute our GBC secretaries around the world, so I am wondering, if you shall be willing to go to some other part of the world for managing things there? Another question, whether or not you are speaking French language nicely? Kindly inform me at Los Angeles Temple, where I am going on May 18th from Honolulu.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
