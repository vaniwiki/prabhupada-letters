My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 2, 1977.

Yes, Dr. Omkar Sharma is the proper man. Regarding Dr. Brojendra Nandan Goswami he is a little flickering and can not be given such heavy responsibility. If he wants to serve there can be no conditions. He has to live under our conditions.

Our students should be taught English and Sanskrit so in the future they can read our books. That will make them MA, PHD. That much I want. Other things are external. And their behavior and character must also be most upstanding. Now you are all senior intelligent men so yourself, Yasodanandana Maharaja and Aksayananda Maharaja cooperatively do everything.

So far a letter authorizing the collecting program which you propose, Tamala Krishna Maharaja has already written as GBC so it is not necessary for me to write.

Adopt whatever means are necessary for raising funds for the loan repayment and permanent maintenance of the Gurukula.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
