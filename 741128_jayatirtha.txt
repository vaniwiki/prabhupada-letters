My dear Jayatirtha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated October 25 and November 9, 1974 with enclosed receipts from the bank. The business card of Mr. Thomas Orr was not enclosed however. I have also received your cable reading as follows: 13,000 DOLLARS GIVEN BY GURU-KRPA TO ME IN JAPAN LAST MONTH DEPOSITED IN BANK OF AMERICA SAVINGS ACCOUNT NOT TRANSFERRED TO INDIA REFER MY LETTER OCTOBER 25 -JAYATIRTHA.

Now enclosed please find one letter to Bank of America. Please see that this letter is executed properly. The Punjab National Bank is taking too long to credit the transfers. You have sent on November 7th and they have credited on November 20th, so we have lost interest for 13 days. So the Bank of America account is now opened. We have also opened an account with First National City Bank in Bombay, and Brahmananda has cabled the account number to Ramesvara, as it is understood he was to transfer Dollars 60,000.00 given by Gurukrpa.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. From your description of the Hawaii estate, it sounds very attractive. The tickets are received here, and I shall inform you when we plan to go.
