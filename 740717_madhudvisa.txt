My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I may request you to send three men to go with Subaladas Swami to Fiji for preaching and opening a temple. There is one Indian man there who wants to give $50,000 for construction of a temple there.

Please do this as soon as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
