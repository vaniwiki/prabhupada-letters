Vrindaban

My dear Dhananjaya das:

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find a copy of my letter dated July 23, 1975 to Syndicate Bank, Vrindaban. Please take the copy and go there and take information whether they have received the amount and done it according to my instructions, and reply to me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
