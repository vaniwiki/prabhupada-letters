My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your encouraging letter dated April 14, 1969, and I am very glad to learn that Mr. George Harrison has given a letter of guarantorship to the Camden Council. One other thing is that Mr. Harrison is purchasing 172 acres of land near London, and it is expected that he will construct a temple of Radha-Krishna there. This is also very encouraging news. If you think that he is serious about it, then I shall send you a nice plan for a Radha-Krishna temple, a facsimile of Govindaji's temple in Vrindaban. It is very expensive, with stone work, and if Mr. George Harrison at all constructs a Radha-Krishna temple, it should be unique in this part of the world. He has got the money, and he can do it. So when he is serious about it, I shall give a nice plan for the temple.

Enclosed is one draft scheme circular letter so please read it and do the needful. I hope this will find you well and in cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
