My dear Devendranath,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 15, 1974.

I have considered your proposal to go to California and start a farm if you can acquire some land. I have been giving instruction to Sudama Maharaja for development of Hawaii center, of which you are presently a member, and our plans include acquiring land here and farming flowers and vegetables. I find hawaii a very suitable place for Krsna Consciousness, and want that a very strong center be established here. Therefore I think the best thing, if you are inclined to farming is to remain and cooperate with Sudama Maharaja and Bali Mardan and Balabhadra and develop Krsna Conscious farming and cow protection here. The tendency for always changing is not good. So I hope these proposals will be agreeable to you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
