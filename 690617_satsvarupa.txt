My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for you letter dated June 14, 1969, sent along with __Krishna__ tapes #11 and #12. The tapes are done very nicely as always. The first thing is that I have written to Jadurani today that she may immediately return to you in Boston. There is some inconvenience in Hawaii for accommodating so many people because the landlady has said there are too many living there. So Jadurani will be returning very soon. I have advised her that she may go on Sankirtana Party in Boston. Regarding your present difficulty with the police, things are going by Krishna's desire, and it will be all right. Try to get recognition from the police that we are a non-profit religious organization. In Los Angeles they have got a permit for begging, so you inquire from Tamala Krishna, and get a copy from him of this permit. We are non-profit religious organization and we have so much expenditure, so try to get this permit. Please keep me posted as to how this is progressing.

Offer my blessings to the others. I am pleased to note that Murari is such a tremendous boon to your activities there, and you "do not know how you managed without him before." I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
