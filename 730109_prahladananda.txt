My dear Prahladananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 31, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, that will be the best idea, to move your Austin temple closer to the University where there are so many potential devotees. Of course, we may set up our camp below any tree and preach anywhere, but because they will expect some comfortable place just to their standard of comfort, therefore we provide, but only so they will be more receptive to our preaching. So whatever must be done, must be done. Now in consultation with Satsvarupa, just do the needful and think always in your mind how much what you are doing will be pleasing to Krsna. That standard for pleasing Krsna is simply to spread this Krsna Consciousness message far and wide all over the globe. So if you are engaged in that activity, somehow or other, for preaching Krsna's name and fame, then that is the proper use of your energy and time, and you have nothing to worry further. So go on in this way, serving your spiritual master to best of your capacity, and remaining always fixed and steady in your determination to fulfill the goal of your life, namely, to go back to home, back to Godhead, without further delay.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
