My dear Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated August 2nd, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. From these letters it appears that things are not yet settled up, and under the circumstances, there is no use of rushing the matter. Settle things up nicely, and when you get the money from Mukunda and the apartment, then arrange for the tickets, and we shall start. So far as I am concerned, I am free to start at any moment on your arrangement. But if you are financially pressed, there is no need to arrange things haphazardly. From your two letters it appears you may be a little bit confused. Do everything coolheadedly. When you send the tickets I shall go.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. It is very much interesting about Professor Bernhard. We want the help of such interested persons for our Krishna Consciousness Movement in Germany. If you meet again Professor Bernhard, you can talk with him that this Krishna Consciousness Movement is for understanding one God, one scripture, one mantra, and one engagement for all living entities, not only within this world, but throughout the whole universe. So far as sacred thread ceremony is concerned, __Bhagavad-gita__ accepts that anyone, from any place, if he is a pure devotee of Lord Krishna, he is above the position of brahmana. When we meet together we shall discuss all these points very nicely. I am also very much anxious to see Professor Bernhard.

You have asked me about my plans: My plan is for preaching with your help. You arrange for everything, and I shall talk about Krishna Consciousness for any length of time, anywhere. That is my mission. You propose to send a wire when everything is arranged. Better send the wire here in Los Angeles; that will be nice. ACB
