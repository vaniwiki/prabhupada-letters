My dear Mr. Ogata:

Please accept my greetings. It is understood that the __Back To Godhead__ department is in debt by $52,000.00. I am very sorry that this has increased so much. Therefore I am sending check no 16-320 for $20,000.00. So please continue to print __Back To Godhead__ magazine without hesitation. Your money is always safe.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
