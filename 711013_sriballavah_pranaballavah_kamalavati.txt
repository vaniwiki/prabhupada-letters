====== Letter to: Sriballavah (Vin Fiocco), Pranaballavah (Bruce Webster), Kamalavati (Elicia Heller) ======

My dear Sons and Daughter,

Please accept my blessings. I have just recently received one letter from Sriman Tulsidas Prabhu and at his recommendation I have gladly consented to accept you all as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads are all chanted and they are enclosed herewith. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

__Sriballavah__ Das Brahmacari (Vin Fiocco). Sriballavah is another name for Narayana.

__Pranaballavah__ Das Brahmacari (Bruce Webster). Pranaballavah means Krishna. Vallabha means beloved and prana means life.

__Kamalavati__ Dasi (Elicia Heller). Kamalavati means the goddess of fortune.

I can understand that you are all very sincere and very much qualified devotees and now by Krishna's grace you are engaged whole-heartedly in His service. So take full advantage of this opportunity and perfect your lives; that is my request. Our process is simple. Follow the regulative principles strictly, chant at least 16 rounds of Hare Krishna mantra daily, read all our books, go for street Sankirtana and in this way be engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours. Then you will be always thinking of Krishna and in the end go back to Krishna, back to home, back to Godhead.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
