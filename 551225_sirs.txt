Dear Sirs,

With reference to the inaugural meeting of the Delhi section of the League on 22/12/55 the gentlemen named above have been selected to be the executive members. The immediate program of work is to find out some suitable place for the central office as also to provide the place of residence for the workers.

When I was at Jhansi, I was provided with a big palatial building to live in associated with 40 workers who are being trained up for intinerary preaching work. The expenses were about Rs 1000/- per month. I approached the Govt for help but even after one year no definite decision could be arrived at by the Govt and the matter is still pending. Jhansi was a poor place & I shifted to Delhi.

My associates were therefore disbursed & I came to Delhi to give it a new life. Delhi is the only centre where from this cultural movement could immediately be given effect because it is the centre of international political, social educational & cultural movements. What I want to do immediately are as follows:---\\
(1) To hold consecutive meetings at different Mohallus & houses of Delhi for impressing the ideas of the mission.\\
(2) To give training to at least 7 to 10 educated young men in the "__parampara lessons of Bhagavad-gita__" and then to "__Brahma Sutra,__" __Bhagavata__ & __Caitanya Caritamrta__\\
(3) To publish an English monthly paper to sell specially to the English knowing heads of the society and to get printed some relative literatures %%__%%.

A meeting of the executives has to be called for discussing the above subjects but before doing so I wish that you all gentlemen may kindly fill up the typed membership forms enclosed herewith---so that following your foot prints other members of the public may %%__%% members of this institution in large numbers.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours faithfully,\\
For the League of Devotees (Reg. J.S.)
