Bhaktivedanta Manor

Dear Pusta Krsna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 18, 1974.

Your report is very encouraging to me, that you distributed 110 Gitas in two days in Capetown, South Africa. You also find that there is good preaching to be done there among intelligent Indians and Europeans. And for the people in general you can hold kirtana and distribute prasadam sumptuously.

So I understand you are now at the Bhaktivedanta Manor assisting Mukunda in strictly following the parampara and encouraging all the devotees in that direction. When your work is done there, you may return to South Africa, and I have asked Mukunda to help you with some men for South Africa. I am also very pleased with the reports I am getting from Brahmananda Swami, so please cooperate with him in Africa.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
