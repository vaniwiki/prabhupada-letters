My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. Below is the second part of the list of life and donor members from India. The first part was enclosed in my letter to you dated 21st April, 1971. This list may also be distributed to all the centers so that any newsletters may be dispatched.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
