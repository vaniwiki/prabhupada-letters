My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18 February, 1970, along with one sheet enclosure, and I am very much pleased with your work. The minor mistake which you committed on the first verse of Isopanisad I marked, but I ignore it as very insignificant. I am very glad to know that you are so much repentant even for this insignificant mistake, and that will push you forward further in Krsna Consciousness. Please be happy and work on with steady and firm determination.

I have read the transliteration of Bhagavad-gita verses, but I think you have to do it very carefully because there are some mistakes in some of the verses. But I am sure in your next reading they will be all corrected.

So your next compositions shall be Bhagavad-gita __As It Is,__ revised and enlarged edition. Please do it nicely.

Your attempt to work on Brahma Samhita is very nice, do it carefully. Regarding the first chapter, eighth verse: the manuscript is correct "Saumadattis tathaiva ca." I have compared the text with Gita Press edition as well as Baladeva. Vidyavhusan's edition.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Arundhati, and be happy in Krsna Consciousness. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Please inform Satsvarupa that I have received his letter. I have consulted with Brahmananda, and I think things are going on nicely.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
