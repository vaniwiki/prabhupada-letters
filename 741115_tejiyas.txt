My dear Tejiyas dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 8, 1974 with enclosure of emigration application. I shall keep it aside and inform you. Regarding your question about collecting, whatever money sent it is all the hand of Krishna. When Krishna gives, you get. Don't be disappointed if you do not get any collection after working. Always depend on Krishna, and everything will be all right. Fight and depend on the results on Krishna. __yudhyasva vigata-jvarah,__ fight without being lethargic, Krishna says in the Bhagavad-gita.

Pushing on this movement, I had to face so many difficulties throughout since I left my home. I lived in Delhi at Sakur Basti because the rent was cheaper there, and I could not even take an apartment in Delhi. Then I was provided with a room at Chippi Walla, Radha Krishna temple, wherein I was able to keep my publication office.

But, by Krishna's grace we are situated on a standard footing. Let us maintain this position cooperatively, and always pray to Krishna that we may not spoil what Krishna has already given us. Try to make improvement more and more.

Regarding you question about keeping open the Deity doors in the early morning, yes you can do it. That is done in Vrindaban also. Regarding the collections, the books are increasing, so 50% should go to BBT and 50% to construction, but if needed, then that money can be spent in other ways.

Now both CBI and State Bank approached us to open a branch bank, so this should now be done, so we can get the foreign exchange transfers. We will be receiving minimum Dollars 10,000.00 per month. Bali Mardan has promised this. Besides this we are getting interest from investments in USA, and also from other sources. So please arrange for either one to open their office on our premises.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
