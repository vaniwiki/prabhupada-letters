Dear Sir:

RE: ACCOUNT #0400688633

I beg to thank you for returning the new passbook, but you have not sent me any deposit slips. I am sending herewith as follows: one cashiers check (#6-6652) from FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF WASHINGTON for forty dollars ($40.00), and one check (#18) from BANK OF MC MECHAN for fifteen dollars ($15.00) for depositing in my account. Please acknowledge receipt and send some deposit slips by return mail.

Yours truly,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
