My dear Yasomatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7/12/76.

The publishing you are doing is very good. That is very enthusiastic propaganda work.

I'm going to Bombay by the end of the third week of December. If possible, try to see me there.

Regarding the artist you have written about, if he can paint improved paintings, we shall publish. Yes, you can bring him to Bombay when you come.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
