My dear Rayarama,

I have not heard from you since a long time. I hope you are doing well with your new job. Now as I am going to send the Gitopanisad to India for printing, please see the 1st and 2nd chapters finally if there are any grammatical or spelling mistakes. Also mark the __verses with diacritic signs__ as they are in Dr. Radhakrishnan's book. Mark the words in synonyms also. When you let me know that you have done it then I shall ask you to send it to India. With my blessings I hope everything is well there.
