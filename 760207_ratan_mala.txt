My dear Ratan Mala devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your invitation letter and I am very glad that your daughter Kum Kum is going to be married. Please convey all my blessings to the bride and bridegroom.

I shall remain in Mayapur up to the Gaura Purnima festival in April. Then I shall go to Delhi for our festival there. It will be a great pleasure for me to see you, your daughter and your new son in law at that time.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
