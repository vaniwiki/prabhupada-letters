My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Sudama Goswami I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads are chanted by me and are enclosed herewith. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Andy Wiernsz/ATENDRIYA DAS

Bill Oliverson/BAHUSIRA DAS

Judy Jones/JITAMITRA DASI

Mary St. John/MAHARHA DASI

Oksana Olenczuk/OMKARA DASI

Vicky Burt/VAJASANA DASI

Now my request to you all is that you very seriously stick to the principles of devotional service, observing strictly the four basic restrictions, and without fail always chant at least 16 rounds on your beads daily, and be happy.

If you practice these basic principles successfully, not forgetting your duty even for a moment, automatically your love for Krishna will come out and you will keep yourselves always enthusiastic to serve Krishna. So you have now got the golden opportunity of this human form of life, and it is not by chance that you have met your spiritual master, so if you are intelligent you will conclude that, whatever else I may do, I must accomplish the supreme goal of my life in this very lifetime and go back to home, back to Godhead. Otherwise, maya is always looking for an opportunity to drag us down, and especially she may attack those devotees who are trying to go away from here. But if you keep yourselves always engaged 24 hours in Krishna's business, and help me spread this Krishna Consciousness movement all over the world, however you are best able to do it in your own way, then you will be freed from all attachment to maya, by Krishna's grace. Just as when the darkness and the light come together, the darkness cannot stand before the light, so maya cannot remain in the presence of Krishna. Always remember therefore to chant Hare Krishna, and that will save you in all circumstances, without any doubt.

Hoping this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
