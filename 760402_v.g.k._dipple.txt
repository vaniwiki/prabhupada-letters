My dear Dipple-Kularatnam,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15-3-76 and I have noted the contents with care. I have forwarded your letter to one of my disciples who is presently in South India, and I have advised him that the two of you can conjointly work together to open a centre in Colombo. That will be very nice, so if by mutual cooperation the two of you can begin a centre there it will very much please me. You can correspond with Pradyumna das Adhikari at the follow address:

Pradyumna das Adhikari,

c/o Raghurama Acarya,

Sri Pejavara Math,

Car Street,

Udipi, S.K.

Karnataka, India

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
