My dear Kurusrestha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 23, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. Your scheme to purchase that building with BBT loan is fully approved by me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
