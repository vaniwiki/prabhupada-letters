Dear Sir:

I thank you very much for your kindly visiting our land the other day. Along with your secretary, Mr. Ramanbhai B. Tolat. The thing is that we are in a little difficulty on account of our entrance road being very narrow. Therefore, I request you to give up your strip of land in front of our Hare Krishna Land for opening the road which will facilitate the traffic congestions. Our Hare Krishna Land is an international institution for preaching Krishna Consciousness all over the world. So, I am seeking your sympathy for these world-wide activities. The other day, your secretary informed me that you will construct a community hall on the road-side, but I know that the strip of land in front of our land will not be required by you. Neither it can be used for any other purpose. So, if you will kindly recommend your committee to give for this great cause, Krishna will be very much pleased upon you without any doubt.

Thanking you,

In anticipation, I am awaiting your reply.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
