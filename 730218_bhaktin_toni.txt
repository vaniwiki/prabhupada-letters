My dear Bhaktin Toni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 1st. with the nice pictures of the Sri Sri Radha-Kalacandji Deities in ISKCON Gurukula. I am very much pleased that the Deities are worshiped so nicely and as this continues, the children there will become more and more purified. These children in Gurukula are the most fortunate children in the world, because right from the beginning they are having the association of Radha and Krishna. This was the case in my childhood also. My father was pure Vaisnava and he gave me and my sister the Radha Krishna Deities to worship and in this way we were trained. And still to this very day my sister is worshiping these very same Deities in Calcutta. So like this the children must be trained.

I can understand from your letter that you are beginning to appreciate the Krishna Consciousness Movement and I encourage you to join wholeheartedly and fully in the service of Lord Sri Krishna for this will be the most glorious thing in your life. You may consult with Karandhara das and he will give you more guidance as to how you can engage yourself fully in the service of the Lord. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
