Hyderabad

My dear Syamasundara das:

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed find a copy of a letter received from Swiss Credit Bank which will speak for itself, but it is not at all desirable. Similar many letters are being received in London. So I shall be glad to hear from you how you are going to adjust things. I do not know where you are now, but I am supposing you are in Hyderabad. I am forwarding this letter there. I hope you will reply this letter with a proper explanation.

It is understood from London that you are a debtor there for many, many pounds, and you are also a debtor to the Society for so many pounds. But, we can wait for repayment, but do not lose your credit of the bank, and immediately write them a letter to keep your credit, as well as our prestige.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
