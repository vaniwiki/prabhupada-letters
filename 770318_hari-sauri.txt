My dear Hari Sauri,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated March 13rd, 1977. Your letter is very nice. You have expressed transcendental sentiments.

As far as knowing Krsna, I am not so fortunate that I claim like that. But still, as a child, I claim the Person Krsna is reality. My estimation may be childish. Just like our Syamasundara's daughter Sarasvati, she believed: "You know who Krsna is? He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead!" Like a child.

Yes, I prayed like that in Sydney: "I can't do anything good to them. But somehow or other I have brought them to You Sir. Now You make them Krsna conscious. Otherwise, how can I do anything? It is beyond my power." When I left Krsna in that condition and when again came back I saw Krsna was doing everything. He is so kind. Krsna can do wonderful things. In Bombay He has done the most wonderful things. Everyone, the whole Bombay appreciates how wonderful. If Krsna likes He can do anything. Now in our New York court case the judge has declared that Krsna consciousness is a genuine religion and has dismissed the case. Is it not Krsna's great blessing?

Be blessed by Krsna. Your sentiments are all very nice. Krsna will help you. Keep in that position, and whenever convenient you can come and serve me, but now your main business is there.

I hope this finds you very well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
