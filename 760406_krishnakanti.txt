My dear Krishna Kanti das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 27, 1976 with enclosed cassette tape and I thank you very much. I very much liked the chanting on this tape. It is very excellent and should be popularized and it will be a great success. Introduce this into every home and that will help them, and if they read our books then finished, no more material life. Yes, when I come also I can make a tape of chanting Hare Krishna but the chanting of Hare Krishna by the other boys on this tape is very nice. Thank you.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
