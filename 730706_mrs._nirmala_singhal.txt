Dear Mrs. Nirmala Singhal,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 29/6/73 and I have carefully noted the contents.

Thank you for appreciating my humble efforts on behalf of my spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja and Lord Caitanya. Whatever I have done it is due to their potency in Krishna Consciousness. My only achievement is that I have not changed what they have taught.

I am glad to hear of victory in the matter of Bombay property. Now it is rebuilt and people are supporting our cause and finding out more about our great movement. You please help and tell everyone how nice chanting Hare Krsna is.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

ACBS/sdg.
