My dear Gopala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 5th July, 1970, along with the new blueprint of French BTG. It is very, very nicely done.

The back cover pictures "1510-1970" has impressed me very much. I do now know who is making these layouts, but the things are being done nicely. Except for the face of the type everything else is done perfectly. So until a nicer edition from Paris is published your practical service to Krsna Consciousness Movement is very much appreciated by me.

I have met your wife in San Francisco. She looks very bright after marriage. Actually she is the choicest girl for you, as you desired. Be happy with your wife and enhance your knowledge in Krsna Consciousness. I am sure she will be a great help in all respects.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
