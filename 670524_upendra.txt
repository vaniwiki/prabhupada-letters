My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your air mail special delivery letter. Thank you very much for the same. I heard that you are not working there in the U.S. Mail dept. And here we want some assistants for the Press Department. But later on it is understood that you are going to work from the 1st June 1967. __If you are working there, you need not come here.__ I am going to San Francisco by the 15th of June 1967. And when I go there I shall talk in details.

Please inform Hayagriva that Gargamuni has sent him the whole set of English Caitanya Caritamrta which he may read carefully and then return it back.

Please convey my blessings to all devotees boys and girls. I am always thinking about you all.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
