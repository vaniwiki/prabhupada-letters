====== Letter to: Jagannatha-suta ======

Los Angeles

My dear Jagannatha-suta dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 10, 1975 and have noted the contents. I have received the new BTG magazine. It is very nice issue. Having the Indian Rathayatra on the cover and the American one on the inside makes a good contrast.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
