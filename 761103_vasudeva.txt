====== Letter to: Vasudeva ======

Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Vasudeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 30/10/76.

I have replied to Ramesvara as follows:

Regarding the Fiji situation, your solution to amend the constitution is nice. Let Vasudeva become president. Your idea to sell BTGs, collect donations, hold kirtanas and distribute prasada profusely, yes, do that. I was given the impression that this temple was to be controlled by the Punja family and our devotees would not have any hand. This was the impression given. We want that a very nice relationship be kept with Vasudeva. It was wanted that he follows our instructions including following the GBC, so that everything can go on nicely. Let one brother be president and one treasurer, and give one good man who can act as secretary. I have not lost confidence in Vasudeva. Now the matter is clear; I'm very much pleased with him so let him remain president and that will please him more, and his brother, treasurer, with one secretary. If the temple remains permanently in Iskcon Fiji's name and cannot be sold, that is very nice; it is not for selling, it is for improving more and more.

Local men must understand our philosophy, then it will be very successful. We cannot import men from outside. We sincerely want that local men, either from Vasudeva's family or any family which will take on the work. We have to work on that line. Just like some of my Godbrothers wanted to take men from India to London but the attempt was a failure; but when I trained up local men then it was successful. I have no objection if Vasudeva's whole family is trained up to take charge of the temple. Local men should not simply become a visitor but they should be trained up to take charge of the temple. That is what I want. As soon as one is a devotee of Krsna, there is no personal ambition. Life is dedicated for Him.

Whatever Ramesvara and yourself will do, that is alright. Now you order huge quantity of Hindi and Gujarati books from our BBT office in Bombay. Distribute as much literature as possible, English, Hindi, and Gujarati. That is real preaching. Thank you very much.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
