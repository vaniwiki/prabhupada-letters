My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find a copy of a letter sent to the Manager, Central Bank of India, Camac Street Branch. Henceforward, you can send all book fund a/c collections to Bombay for credit in International Society for Krishna Consciousness Book Fund Account no. 14876, Gowalia Tank Branch, Bombay-26.

Also I have received one letter from Gurudasa Prabhu dated 21st July, 1971 and have noted the contents. I have received report from Bombay that things are going on very nicely there, so there is no need for him to go there at the present time.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
