My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21st January, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear that you are making a determined effort to increase the life membership program. The program has become so successful here in India and I am sure that it will become even more successful in U.S.A. So do it enthusiastically and with perseverance and Krishna will help you.

Also your college program sounds very nice. Preaching in schools, colleges and universities, along with distribution of our books and prasadam will flourish the propaganda of our mission.

It is good that you GBC members are meeting and conjointly discussing such things as life membership, book distribution, etc. The future hope of solid standing of our mission is on the proper management of our governing body. Now we are increasing in volume. The area of our activity is expanding. Under the circumstances, if our management goes on nicely to maintain our prestige and good name, that will be our success. Such status quo can be maintained only on our being freed from any kind of sense gratifying attitude, because pure devotional service means: __anya avhilasita sunya__ or without any other desire than to satisfy Krishna.

You have written one note to Hansadutta that you have received a very nice offset press and you are contemplating printing a daily newspaper. About this I've already written to you in my last letter, that to start a daily newspaper involves a proficient staff to manage this affair as well as a good source of regular news. So the governing body may consider these points and do the needful. But if it is done, it will be a great achievement.

So far as the three packages of slides sent here by you, so far we have not received them. Maybe they are lying somewhere because we are travelling from one place to another. So if you want to send duplicate copy, send to the Bombay address given above, because I am reaching there by the 1st of March, 1971.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
