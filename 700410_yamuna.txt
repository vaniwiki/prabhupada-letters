====== Letter to: Yamuna ======

My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your burfi. It is so nicely made. Lest it go out of stock, I am eating only a very little quantity daily. But how you have made it, if you send the formula, maybe Nanda Kumar or Devananda may be able to prepare it.

I hope you are taking care of the Deities with greater attention, and teaching your younger God brothers and sisters to follow the Arcana bidhi. As we open many branches, we shall require many devotees like you to take care of the Deities very nicely.

So be happy in Krsna Consciousness and I shall pray to Lord Krsna for your greater achievement in devotional service. Thank you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
