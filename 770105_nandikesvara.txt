My dear Nandikesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil requesting initiations.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept these devotees: for first initiation: John---Jamahara-dasa, Don---Danapti-dasa, Andre---Aprakrtadasa, Cindy---Sindura-dasi, Sylvy---Siddhidasi, Clemence---Klesaghni-bhakti-dasi, and for second initiation: Jaya Govinda dasa, Sadapusta dasa, Paranagara dasa. Instruct the devotees to always chant a minimum of sixteen rounds and to follow the four regulative principles very strictly. One of the GBC or sannyasis may chant on the beads. Hold a fire sacrifice. Teach the second initiates how to count on their finger divisions and let them hear the tape of me chanting Gayatri mantra.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Gururaj's name is Guru-prasada dasa\\
