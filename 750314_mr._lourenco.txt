My dear Mr. Lourenco,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18-9-74 and have noted the contents. Thank you for reading my books and appreciating them. Please continue to do so. That will help you advance nicely in spiritual life. By reading my books and chanting Hare Krishna, your life will become perfect. The reason for the Japa beads is so that you can keep track of how many times you are chanting Hare Krishna mantra daily. It should be chanted a steady amount of times regularly. We chant at least 16 times around the string of 108 beads daily (one full mantra on each bead). This keeps us strong in spiritual consciousness. Try to visit our temples in London, Paris, Rome, etc. as much as you can. The association of the devotees there will help you to become fixed in Krishna Consciousness. If this is not possible then you can correspond with the devotees at those temples.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
