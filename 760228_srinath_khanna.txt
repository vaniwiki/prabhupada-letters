My dear Srinath Das Khanna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15th January, 1976.

It is too bad that you are suffering too much. However this may be taken as the mercy of the Lord. If the Lord gives us some inconvenience then we may take it that He has reduced our actual punishment and just given us a token punishment. So you remain fixed up at the Lotus Feet of the Supreme Personality Sri Krishna and by always thinking of Him and trying to render some little service to Him, everything will come out all right.

It is nice that you are chanting the Hare Krishna maha-mantra and reading the __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ Continue that and Krishna will surely give you protection as He states: __kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhakta pranasyati__ [[books:bg:9:31|(Bg. 9.31)]].

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
