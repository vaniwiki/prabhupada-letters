Calcutta

My dear Vrindaban:

Please accept my blessings. I am just now in Calcutta and have received your letter dated 16/9/74 addressed to Vrindaban. I am going to Mayapur tomorrow morning, so you can come there and see me to explain about your business situation.

So far I know, you have not sold any books of ours. More when we meet.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
