My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 4th May, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far as the donated offset press is concerned, if it is being used locally, then there is no need of sending it to India. Go on with your work there.

Regarding distribution of Spiritual Sky Incense profits to aleviate financial difficulties, you GBC members decide amongst yourselves as to the proper course of action and whatever you decide amongst yourselves, I have no objection.

You will be glad to know that I have ordered 50,000 paperback KRSNA books. Rupanuga has expressed his opinion that we should get $1.95, but that is too much. I will make it $.95 instead of the $.75 originally proposed.

We have just now concluded our "Hare Krishna Festival" here in Calcutta and it was very successful, even more so that in Bombay; daily 35,000 people were attending. Now we are wanting to make twelve such programs in the greater Calcutta area; one each month. In that way we will win over the city. From here I shall be going to London via Bombay or else to Russia. Then I shall return to U.S.A.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
