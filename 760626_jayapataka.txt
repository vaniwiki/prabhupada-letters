Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 11, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning the doubts of the commission: 1). Christians also convert. It is not conversion from Christian to Hindu. We convert atheist class of men to take God-consciousness. God is one. It is not the question of Christianity, Hindu, Muslim; any religion that teaches to love God is genuine. It has nothing to do with Hinduism, Mohammedanism, etc. 2). Sources (of funds) means we get contributions from all over the world. All of our branches will gladly contribute. Practically this institution is the real U.N. We have the co-operation from all nations, all religions, all communities, etc. It will be an international institute. To see the planetarium and how things are universally situated has nothing to do with sectarian ideas. It is a scientific presentation of spiritual life. 3). The local Mohammedans have already agreed.

Concerning the food relief funds, I am not holding them. The food relief funds go directly from Los Angeles to Calcutta. I have already informed Ramesvara Maharaja to transfer the funds to Calcutta that are available. He has agreed to send Rs. 25,000 already and you should be receiving that soon.

Enclosed are some copies of important book reviews and letters which may be helpful in dealing with the commission. The letter by Subrahmanyam is especially very nice.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Why Prabhu Svarupa das from Haridasapur is now living with us? He was supposed to arrange for the transfer of the land to us, but now no further word? I understand that he is a disciple of Bon Maharaja and he may have ulterior motives; inquire and inform me
