My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters of the 15 and 16th inst., as well as the Janmastami day circular. I am so much pleased that everything is going on so nicely in Montreal, and that you are ever more actively engaged for Krishna, even in the absence of myself and Kirtanananda, It is a great credit to you, and I thank you for it. You should know that it is all due to your sincerity of heart; when we are sincere, Krishna will always help us, either in external direction by the Spiritual Master, or internally by His Paramatma expansion. The program you have decided on for the Lord's Advent Day is nice. I also very much appreciate the work you are doing in trying to promote my books and record, and I am very glad to know that the new BTG is selling well. These publication are the backbone of our movement, and if we can distribute them successfully. then everything will be all right.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
