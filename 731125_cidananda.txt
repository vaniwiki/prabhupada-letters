My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings.

I am in due receipt of your letter and your kind words to me. Thank you very much.

I should be returning to Los Angeles the last week of November and I should be more than happy to see you there. Please always try to remember me by my teachings and we shall always be together. Just like I have written in the first publications of Srimad-Bhagavatam, "The spiritual Master lives forever by His divine instruction and the disciple lives with him.", because I have always served my Guru Maharaja and followed His teachings I am now even never separated from Him. Sometimes Maya may come and try to interfere but we must not falter, we must always follow the chalked out path layed down by the great acharya's and in the end you will see.

I hope this letter finds you healthy and in blissful serving mood.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
