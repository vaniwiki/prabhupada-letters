St. Louis

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 19, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I am especially glad to see how nicely your St. Louis Temple is distributing Back To Godhead Magazine. Only three years ago I asked Dai Nippon to print 20,000 copies and barely we could distribute them. But now in your temple alone you are distributing so many, so this is very, very encouraging to me. It is the perfect form of preaching. Follow the line laid down by Prahlada Maharaja and try to take every one back to home, back to godhead. And this is done by distributing our literature. I am so much pleased upon each and every one of you for helping me this way to push on this great movement.

Please find enclosed one sacred thread duly chanted by me. Now, hold the fire yajna ceremony and give Gayatri mantra to Socillia Dasa. Let him hear with earphones into his right ear the tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra and teach him to count on the finger divisions. The yajna should be held only in the presence of devotees. The world requires this Krishna consciousness movement, and for this purpose there must be a class of brahmanas for giving spiritual guidance by example. So you are one of the big leaders and you are nice, intelligent boy, so may such brahmanas, more and more.

Yes, why not once again start the St. Louis Newsletter, and send me a copy.

I hope this finds you and your all the temple inmates in the best health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
