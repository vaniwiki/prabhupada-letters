Rome

My dear Haihaya das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 7, 1974 and was glad to hear from you. So I want you to organize Rome temple for the time being. When you train up someone and produce sufficient literatures in the Italian language, then you go to the Spanish speaking countries. We have got a few books in Spanish language, and they are selling them in south America.

I look forward to seeing the Italian Sri Isopanisad. In France they have now published. There is very good scope in Europe for this Sankirtana movement. If you just spread this chanting in Europe, then it becomes Vaikuntha. Side by side push on the literature distribution as far as possible. This should be done very vigorously, and you will have great success there. My guru maharaj was always very pleased when even a small pamphlet was distributed. So I thank you for your assisting me in this mission to fulfill the order of my guru maharaj.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
