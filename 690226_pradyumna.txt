My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 19, 1969, and I am pleased that you are doing very nicely in your center. The pictures which you have sent are also very nice. I am going to New York by the first of April or by the end of March. From there I shall go to your side, Columbus and New Vrindaban.

By no means should you stop kirtana and chanting. Of course I know that you cannot stop kirtana or chanting but it must be done regularly because that is our strength. We are always in the whirlpool of maya, and only this chanting of Mantra can save us from all pitfalls.

Regarding your need for records, Mr. Kallman has cheated us in so many ways, so I am therefore thinking of making a new record of Hare Krishna vibration. But if you now have a tape recording machine then you can have the kirtana record in tapes. The cost of such tapes can be found out from Dinesh in Los Angeles.

Now we have to sell __Back To Godheads__ in large quantities. We are arranging to print 20,000 copies so you should seriously consider how to step up this program in Columbus. I am very pleased that Mr. Cline is helping you in looking for a suitable temple there. Please keep me informed of your progress in this matter.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
