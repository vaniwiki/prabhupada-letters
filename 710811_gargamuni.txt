Kathmandu

My dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very kind letter dated 31st July, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so much encouraged to learn that you have come to Kathmandu, Nepal. Please try and organize a center there nicely. It will be a great credit for you. Nepalese are mostly Hindus and they will take to this Krishna Consciousness movement very easily. Simply you have to organize it nicely. Since I went to India I have had some correspondence with one Shekhar Prasad Shrestha (1/111 Dharam Bazar; Koshi Anchal; Nepal). He is very much wanting that we go there and open a center. So you can contact him and do the needful. Perhaps he will be able to help you in Kathmandu also.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
