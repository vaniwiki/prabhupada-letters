My dear Nayana Bhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14th January, 1971. Also I have received the two American express money orders one for $65.00 and one for $1.00 enclosed therein as well as a $15.00 maintenance fund check sent by your good self some weeks before and received by me on 29th December, 1970.

I am pleased to note that Karen Anderson has been endorsed by you for initiation and certainly I will accept her as my disciple. Presently I am inquiring into purchasing a quantity of tulasi beads here. When I secure them, then I shall duly chant on one set for Karen and dispatch them forthwith. The $50.00 initiation donation was duly received and you can thank Karen very much for her contribution to my book fund. Actually that is the parampara system. The newly initiated disciple is immediately supposed to beg alms and make a presentation to the spiritual master. If such presentation is not made, if they do not follow the system, how the effect will be there? So far as Bhaktijana getting himself married, I have already written him about this.

Also I have received the newspaper clippings enclosed by you. The program there in Philadelphia is always so much encouraging. Continue in this way and distribute our books nicely and Krishna will be pleased upon you to give you more and more facility for service.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
