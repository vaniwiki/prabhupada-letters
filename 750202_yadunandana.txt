====== Letter to: Yadunandana ======

Dallas

My dear Yadunandana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 22, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your child, the vedic philosophy is that the miseries of the material body must be tolerated. When material body is there, we must expect so many problems. Considering these things, it is up to you to decide what to do.

It seems to be the best thing to continue our Gurukula program in Dallas, at least for now. However, the GBC is considering building another school at New Vrndavana since one very wealthy man has offered to do so. You can contact Kirtanananda Svami in this connection.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
