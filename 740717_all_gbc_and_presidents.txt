MEMO TO ALL CENTERS

To all GBC and Presidents:

Please accept my humble obeisances at your feet. Srila Prabhupada has especially requested that henceforth there should be no approaches made to Alfred Ford or his family members for donations for temples. Prabhupada will personally handle these types of communications between Alfred Ford and our Society.

Also all devotees when writing a letter to Srila Prabhupada should include the return address on the letter and not only the envelope. Sometimes the envelope gets lost, and if there is no return address on the letter it is difficult to address the reply. All temples should be sure to print their full temple address on their letterhead, and not just have the name of the society with a blank space for the camp address which is sometimes omitted by the writer of the letter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your servant,\\
Brahmananda Swami\\
