My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th March, 1970. I have initiated Denise Clapper as you have advised, and her spiritual name is Dvijapatni. I am sending her beads enclosed herewith. So now train her up nicely in Krsna Consciousness and when you find a nice brahmacari she may be married. That will be very nice. Then after some time she may go with her husband for starting a new center when they are ready. My idea is to train up many devotees and as soon as they are ready send them for starting new branches.

In the meantime, I am very glad to learn of your ten hours daily Sankirtana schedule, and that you have found a very good house for a new Temple. The building and location are very well suited to our needs, so why not acquire it as soon as possible? If you can purchase this house immediately, because Krsna is offering such a nice opportunity, that will be very encouraging. Please offer my blessings to all the Prabhus there. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
