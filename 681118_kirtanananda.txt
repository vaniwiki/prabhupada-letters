My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your short note along with Hayagriva's letter. I am so glad to receive your note because I was a little restless for not receiving your letters since a few days. I have written already to Hayagriva about New Vrndavana how I am thinking of this place. And let us jointly endeavor for fulfilling this purpose. Yes, this climate of California, especially Los Angeles is very nice. I am always anxious to go and see the Govardhana hills in New Vrindaban and I hope Krishna will fulfill my desire as soon as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
