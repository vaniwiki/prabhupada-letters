Hamburg

My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. Please don't be worried at all. I shall never give your husband sannyasa order. There is no special meaning for giving your husband sannyasa order because I know that both of you are more than sannyasi. So don't be worried at all. Live peacefully, husband and wife and develop our Hamburg center very nicely.

Always be engaged in serving the Deity; nice dress, nice jewelry, nice prasadam. Let Hansadutta go for Sankirtana and take care of him. Your husband is one of my most foremost disciples. His life is very important, so take care of him nicely; that is your duty. He should live healthfully and peacefully, so see to it. That is my request. And together you should develop Hamburg center very nicely. There is certainly enough work there now.

For your hair you can try a little castor oil. So far the milk fast, if possible you can observe it. But these things are not so important. For preaching work we have to make so many adjustments.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
