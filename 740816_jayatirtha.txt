My dear Jayatirtha das:

Please accept my blessings. With regard to the collections of Gurukrpa Swami that he pays to DNP henceforth, the equivalent amount should be transferred to India as follows: 50% to Mayapur Project in care of American Express Calcutta ISKCON a/c # 090031; and 50% to Vrindaban Project direct.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
