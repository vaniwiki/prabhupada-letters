Vrindaban

My dear Prabhavisnu dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 20, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care. Concerning the set of Srimad-Bhagavatams that Dr. Tripati gave us in Aligarh, I happen to know that the complete set should not cost more than Rs. 700, like that. And besides that, the paper may be so brittle that it may be useless. That I can examine when I see the set of books personally in Vrindaban. But, I know that the set of books could not cost so much, Rs. 3,000/-. So wait until I see the books in Vrindaban on my return and then we shall do the needful. At this point there is no need to immediately give Dr. Tripati honorary patron membership. I thought that he was giving the books as an offering.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
