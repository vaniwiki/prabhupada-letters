Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Vijaya das,

Please accept my blessings. I hope that everything is going nicely there in Fiji. I have heard that Mr. Punja is now enlivened to work with us again. This is very good. He can help us in many ways, and he is a devoted man. You are a devotee, so this is the process, yasya prasadad bhagavata prasadao . . . So, kindly follow my instructions very carefully and work co-operatively with Asta Siddhi das. That will be good for you and the people in general. Do not deviate in any way.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
