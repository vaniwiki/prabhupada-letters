====== Letter to: Harikesa ======

Frankfurt

My dear Harikesa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 19/10/76.

Thank you for making payment on my loan to you at 12% interest. I'm very glad. It's alright that you have sent it to Los Angeles.

I am very pleased to learn of our success in Yugoslavia. When there is a little hope of success in these countries, it encourages me 100 times more than in other places. If they take up this Krishna Consciousness, they'll take it very seriously. This is the perfection of Communist ideology. Everything belongs to God. No private proprietorship. They have gone on the radio, that means they have purified the whole atmosphere. That is the way to introduce, the transcendental sound vibration will act. Utilize this approach. Gradually try to convince them that this movement is the perfection of Communism. Go on singing Krsna kirtana. That is our program. Caitanya Mahaprabhu used to go out chanting. He never spoke philosophy in public, only among higher circles. The chanting is very effective. Along with tampura and mrdanga played very rhythmically let them chant. Perform this musical demonstration and sell books as far as possible, and feasting. Then everything will be successful. It is good that they do not like these bogus yogis and they like Hare Krsna mantra. Give them the chance to chant the Hare Krsna maha mantra somehow or other, then very soon good results will be visible.

I am not very much in favor of Gurudasa coming here. Let him know that his former wife, Yamuna, is here, therefore he should not come. Why is he so adamant to come here. He can come later during the Mayapur festival. Why doesn't he join with you until Mayapur at least?

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
