My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. Just recently I have received one letter from Pavanadeva Prabhu requesting second initiation at the recommendation of both yourself and Karandhara. So I am enclosing herewith one sacred thread, properly made and duly chanted by me and also one paper with Gayatri mantra. The procedure should be as follows for presenting Pavanadeva with sacred thread: First you must secure a tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra from Karandhara in L.A. or Jayananda in Berkeley. Let Pavanadeva hear the tape privately and through the right ear. He should recite, after me, the words aloud. Beforehand you can show him how to chant (count) on the fingers. Then you must hold a fire yajna before you get this thread on his body.

Please offer Pavanadeva my blessings and acknowledge receipt of his letter. The proper spelling of his name is shown herewith. So far my health is concerned, I am quite all right now. Only there was a slight indication of heart attack but Krishna saved me. It was not very acute. So long Krishna will keep me fit I will go on working, so you devotees should pray to Krishna that I might go on serving Him up to the last point of my death.

Hoping this will meet you all in good heath.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
