====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 12, 1973. Regarding the entry certificate from the Home Office of Great Britain, what is the value of such a certificate if it remains at the discretion of the local immigration officer whether or not the certificate can be expeditious in passing through immigration? If you are able to get such an entry certificate for me in London then go ahead, otherwise I do not think it is worth the botheration for me to apply personally.

Regarding Bhadra Krsna das, so it turns out that he is a rascal. So forget about him and go on with your business. I have read your sample excerpt from the brochure and it is very nice. Kindly keep me informed of the progress there.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
