====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

Bombay

Dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 28, and read the contents.

Yes, train the others in responsibilities in Bombay, and go on as you are doing.

In five days at Kumbhamela we were able to distribute 30,000 pieces of literature. Therefore we can expect to receive 1 lakh collections per month from all the centers.

It is good news hearing good preachers like Jagat Guru and Sridhara Swami Maharajas, and Madhavananda are arriving to Bombay to push on the membership, other preaching and collecting.

As for your plan to invite university students to spend the weekend, it is very good; do it.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have received a letter from the Bombay secretary, Aditya dasi, requesting me to sign a number of legal forms for the bank. Neither you or Gopala Krsna have even signed or initialled an approval, so how can I sign these forms? If you actually want me to sign them please write me your approval with regular signature.\\
