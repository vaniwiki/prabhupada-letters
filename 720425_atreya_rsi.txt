My dear Atreya Rsi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 17, 1972. I am returning back to Los Angeles by the 20th May. At that time it will be a great pleasure to have your association there.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
