My dear Karandhara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter dated August 13, 1976. So you are already engaged in the service of Krsna. Stick to it and that will make you perfect. You are following the regulative principles. This is our spiritual strength and you are most fortunate that you have got a very good wife. Your wife met me in NY and New Vrndavana and she is a very great devotee.

I know that you are competent to manage any department, whichever department you like you can render your service and keep yourself peaceful with your good wife. There is no impediment for grhasthas to become fully Krsna conscious. All of Caitanya Mahaprabhu's associates were grhasthas and all of them helped Caitanya Mahaprabhu in His missionary activities. Later on He took sannyasa and specifically He was assisted by Svarupa Damodara, but still He had intimate relations with grhasthas like Advaita Acarya, Nityananda, Gadadhara, and Srivas Thakura.

So, in whichever status of life you may remain, if you stick to the principles, then you are alright. I am going to Vrndavana. If it is convenient you can stay for some time in Vrndavana with your family.

I always think of you as I do think of my other disciples, and surely Krsna will help you to become a very strong devotee of the Lord. Please offer my blessings to your wife and children.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
