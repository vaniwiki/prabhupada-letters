====== Letter to: Eugene L. Baum ======

St. Louis

My dear Eugene L. Baum,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kindly presentation of $20.00 for my book fund. We require such funds so that we can print our books and over-flood all of the world with Krishna Conscious literature. That is the goal.

I am so glad to hear that you have been staying at our St. Louis center under the expert guidance of Sriman Vamanadeva Prabhu and have been chanting 16 rounds of beads daily. Continue to do so faithfully and follow all the regulative principles of devotional life. If there are any questions, refer them to your god-brothers and sisters. And just as soon as you are recommended for initiation by Vamanadeva, I will be glad to accept you as my duly initiated disciple.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
