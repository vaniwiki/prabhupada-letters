My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th December, 1970.

You write to say that on last Monday morning you were to see Mr. G. R. Jolly, but you talked with Hansadutta by trunk call this morning and you did not mention anything about your meeting with Mr. Jolly. If Jolly accepts our terms of Rs. 50,000 down immediately and the balance to be paid by Rs. 2,000 every month as I have advised you previously, then why not settle up the thing that way? If these terms are settled up, then I can pay him immediately Rs. 50,000 down payment on my arrival in Bombay.

I am very glad that you are working in Bombay with great enthusiasm. As you say that Bombay is like a dream for Krsna Consciousness, you may take the Bombay Center very seriously and do it nicely. The program of work of two parties working canvassing Life Members is very nice. The only thing is we require immediately a nice place to keep your assistants. If the Jolly business is not settled up, then you immediately try to have some place on rental basis.

We are all leaving Surat on Sunday the 4th January, 1971, by the Flying Ranee, reaching Bombay Central at 10.30 AM the same morning. I hope by the time I reach Bombay the registration of the Society and other things might have been finalized. Please keep the Tandberg tape* recorder ready.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*as well as my Bank Pass book made up to date.\\
P.S. Enclosed herewith, please find one letter to be signed by you and sent to the editor of the Times replying the several letters which you have sent me cut from the recent editions of the Times.

This letter is very important and you may personally hand over the same to the Editor so that it may be published immediately. We invite all kinds of men to discuss on this high philosophy of life. ACB.\\
