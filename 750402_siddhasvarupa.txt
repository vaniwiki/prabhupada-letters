My dear Siddhasvarupa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12th of March, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your kind donation of 1,000 U.S. Dollars. Your small booklet seems very nice. I am very glad that you have taken my request to heart and that you are now preaching in so many nice ways. This is very satisfying to me. You are executing the duty of a sannyasi very well by this preaching. Now continue it and you will simply become more and more expert in your preaching ability.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
