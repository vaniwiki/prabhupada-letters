My dear Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 22, 1969, and I am very encouraged to learn of your nice activities in Hamburg. I am so pleased to know that Uttama Sloka and yourself are now working in the printer trade, and Sivananda is busily engaged in decorating the temple. Similarly, it is very good that you are holding outside engagements for organizations outside of the temple and you are meeting with interested people. But perhaps the best news of all is that soon we shall have our own press for printing Krishna Consciousness literature in the German language. Our life and soul is kirtana and presenting literature to the public at large, and I can understand that Krishna is dictating to you from within how to carry this out successfully. I think that translation work should be done on such articles that may be included in a German edition of __Back To Godhead,__ as well as my __Introduction to Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ I am wondering if there are people there who can speak English with you. Please inform me on this matter.

Regarding Jaya Govinda, if he is willing to go there, you can deposit the fare money to the American Express Company in Hamburg, and the American Express Company in Delhi should deliver to Jaya Govinda the ticket. But he should not be sent cash money. Make arrangements so that, if upon receipt of the ticket he still does not come, the money shall be returned back only to you in Hamburg. In this way make the arrangements.

Please convey my blessings to Sivananda and Uttama Sloka. I hope you are all very well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: You may have the ticket for Jaya Govinda sent to the New Delhi branch of American Express Company at the following address: American Express, Hamilton House, block "A", Connaught Place (tel. 43553). Three hundred and fifty dollars is about 2625 Rupees. I am writing to Jaya Govinda today to give him this address also.
