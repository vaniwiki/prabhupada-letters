My dear Balabhadra das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 10, 1974 and have noted the contents. I understand that all the others from Scotland have gone to Bhaktivedanta Manor, so why do you not go there also and get recommended by the temple President for Brahminical initiation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
