My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 4th August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. So far your engagement is concerned, you should concentrate on the Australian side. If possible try and develop Kuala Lampur also. That is your jurisdiction, so develop it nicely. And there you should try and distribute our books and literatures as far as possible.

Regarding Kamala Devi, the clear idea should be that if she is interested in us being there, then she should construct the temple according to our design and we shall keep at least ½ dozen men there for keeping the Deity nicely and eventually to organize an ashram there also. She should give us proper facility. How else we will work?

I have also received one letter from Lalit Prasad Thakur and have replied it.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
