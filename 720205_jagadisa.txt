My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your report of January 28, 1972, and I am very pleased to hear that you are putting your full energy into distributing books and magazines very widely all over Canada. It is not so much the numbers of books sold, it is the sincerity which Krishna appreciates, and I am encouraged by your determined enthusiasm to increase in every respect. The travelling SKP and teaching in the schools and colleges which you are organizing is excellent proposal, and I think that this is the best program for pushing on this Lord Caitanya's Movement: simply travelling and preaching, and infiltrating the schools where young boys and girls are interested to learn something which will satisfy them. In both activities you may distribute many of our literatures, and that will please me very much.

Our so-called religion is unique in the world, simply because we stand solidly on philosophy, and because we are strong in that way, no one can refute or defeat us, so we are wiping out sentimental religion wherever we penetrate and it appears the people everywhere are accepting us more and more. I am glad that it is your opinion that KC will be the National Religion in ten years. I have heard from some devotees in Vancouver that new branches are opening in other cities of Canada. That is very, very nice.

Hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
