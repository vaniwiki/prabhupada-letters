My dear Sahadeva das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 10, 1974 and have noted the contents. I have also seen the photos. Regarding the Life Members, you cannot impose rules on the guests. They can remain two or three days as guests, so there should be no difficulty.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
