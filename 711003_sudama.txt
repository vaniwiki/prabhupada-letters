====== Letter to: Sudama ======

Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your pictures and note and it has so much engladdened me that I must admit that there is a little fraction of Caitanya Mahaprabhu's merciful glance upon you. You are alone doing such marvelous work and it is impossible for a person without being blessed by Krishna. So you should always be conscious of this special favor upon you and continue to work more vigorously to get more and more blessings of Lord Caitanya and his disciplic succession. Remain fixed up in your spiritual regulative principles. Chant not less than 16 rounds regularly and preach this cult of Krishna Consciousness to the Japanese people to the best of your knowledge and you will get more and more strength in the matter of preaching work.

What happened to your wife and to Bhanu? So far registration is concerned, we have got our society registered in Kenya in three days. The procedure followed was: If you want to base the registration on the London constitution, you should write to London to get an original certified copy of the articles of association and articles of memorandum. You can write Dayananda in this regards. The thing is that the International Society for Krishna Consciousness was registered under the companies act with limited liability. The above mentioned articles of association and memorandum were presented here and were immediately accepted and the certificate of registration was given.

So get our society immediately registered. Call men from U.S.A. or anywhere else and go on, vigorously preaching in the university campuses as you have sent me the photos. I think that place is the best for pushing on our Krishna Consciousness movement. We are doing very well here also and a big meeting in the university of Nairobi will be held on the 6th instant.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
