My dear Gopijanavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 1, 1974 and have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the abhiseka ceremony, actually it is to be done. There were mlecchas activities. But it does not required to be done because hari nama is going on, but if it is done for the general satisfaction, it will be better. It is Krsna's mercy how easily they were purged out, otherwise it was reported that they were creating a very dangerous situation.

Regarding the discounts from BBT, that may be stopped. You should receive books at the regular temple price. Then when there is the necessity of money the BBT will supply for purchasing the house. No further discount is required.

I am simply surprised how Bali Mardan became so influenced.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
