My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17 March, 1970, and noted the contents. In the meantime, I have also received your note dated 18 March, 1970, along with the new set of beads for Nityananda Das. I do not know how they have been lost from the packet in the mail. But I have duly chanted this new set, and they will be sent securely wrapped.

Regarding printing of KRSNA on the cover and Title, it should not be "KRSNA Book," but it should be "KRSNA" in large type on the first line, that is the Title, and on the second line, by way of adjective, "The Supreme Personality of Godhead" should be printed in smaller type.

Regarding the salesman's statement that the printing would take 8 months, so we cannot wait for 8 months. They have given reference in their letter No. ODCUMIS-L/70-115, dated 5 February, 1970, as follows; "we would like to show you our rough schedule of typesetting, Printing and binding.

Typesetting---45 days

Printing---20 days

Binding---20 days"\\
So that is a total of 85 days or in other words about 3 months. Now why are they asking so much time?

Therefore do not accept a new schedule, which may be 8 months, because we have already received the schedule from Mr. Haru Kugimoto, who is head of their Overseas Division, and his word should not be overruled by that of a salesman.

Regarding picture pages, sections of 8 pages together is not nice. The pictures should be just at the appropriate place of description in the text. There are many modern glues which will not loosen for a very long time, so glueing is not a problem. I think that this method of insetting the picture pages is best, and even better if they can be each protected by a leaf of waxed paper also. That will be best. So do what ever you think is best for getting the book ready (printed) as soon as possible.

Regarding the almanac, all your subjects included are approved by me. So there is nothing to add, just see that it is finished printing before Lord Caitanya's Appearance day.

I have received the new issues of __Easy Journey,__ and I have very much appreciated the color picture on the cover. It is very much improved. Please offer my thanks to Advaita and his assistants.

I think all our books can be printed in such small booklets, part by part, and they will be easily saleable. Take for example TLC. If we issue part by part like that, it will be about 5 books. So people will easily buy, and our purpose will be served. Discuss the idea with your colleagues.

Somehow or other, we shall overflood the market with Krishna Conscious literature. That will create our prestige, and being cheap distribution, many people will learn our philosophy. Another point is that while BTG is delayed, you can sell these.

I am very glad to learn about New York's situation. New York must have a nice Temple as Los Angeles as soon as possible. That will be prestige for New York City. __Next__ weekend, you can transfer my bank money, as addressed by you personally.

Regarding color pictures in __Nectar of Devotion,__ this will be nice because Advaita has improved. Even the quality of __Easy Journey__ will do, but I hope he will improve more. Please offer my thanks to Advaita and all the others for taking so much trouble for Krishna Consciousness literature.

The address which you have received from Readers Digest is not the same address as I gave you, but whatever it may be, they are a large agent, and you can open correspondence as our distributer in India and settle terms. Send them some selected copies of BTG.

Thank you for the enclosure of the picture printed in "Horizon" Magazine, it is very nice. Was there any description printed along with the picture?

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
