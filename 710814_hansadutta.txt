My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. For the time being this measure of taking outside work may be taken up but the principle is that everyone should engage full time for various propaganda work of the Krishna Consciousness Movement and maintain themselves by the little profit made by book selling and literature distribution. Now we have got Isopanisad in German language. The devotees can better be engaged in distributing these books.

Where is Mandali Bhadra? I have not heard from him. What he is doing now? What has happened to ISKCON Press Europa? Since I have come to London, why I have not heard anything from him?

So far Krishna das is concerned, first let Krishna das go there to Moscow. You are in Hamburg already. There is no need of you both being there. You should stay there and develop that center. There is no question of your travelling just now. So let Krishna das go to Russia. He is very much enthusiastic for it.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health. My blessings for Himavati.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
