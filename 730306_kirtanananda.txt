My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for for your letter dated the 3rd of March 1973 along with your kind daksina $200 check. Thank you very much, I have received your pamphlet inviting to participate in New Vrndavana activities. It is an excellent pamphlet nicely set up, but I am sorry to inform you that your co-founder Hayagriva Prabhu is little disturbed. Sometimes before you told about him participating in intoxication. Then I did not take it seriously, but the same thing is again revived and I am little perturbed. So is it possible to save him from this dangerous position? His is important man in our Society and we cannot allow him to deviate from our principles. Please try to save him.

I heard before that Birbadra is under your control, is that a fact? Hayagriva told me is under your control.

I shall secure gold Sesa and carry with me for the foundation and most propably while returning to L.A. through New York at that time if the ceremony is being held I shall attend. It will be a pleasure for me. Your vision of 7 Temples on 7 hills is very encouraging. May Krsna fulfill your transcendental desires. The graphic drawings of the Temples are very satisfactory and the devotees working together is very encouraging. May Krsna help you in your noble endeavor to come out successful in the project of New Vrndavana. Your Krsna is most beautiful, just like an attractive boy. I hope this meets you in good health.
