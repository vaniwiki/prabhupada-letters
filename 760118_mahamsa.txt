My dear Mahamsa,

Please accept my blessings. I have already informed you what is our purpose in the matter of the Nellore establishment. The ladies must be clearly informed that we are not at all interested to be dictated by them. We cannot construct a meditation hall with Sarasvati and Ganesa or create a library with hodgepodge books. We can simply have our Radha Krishna Temple with facilities for the people in general to study our philosophy joining us in our Krishna Consciousness Movement and as we are doing in our other centres we shall act accordingly.

If they refuse to give us in so-called charity the whole land then we can purchase the vacant land at the price mentioned in the document and because we have already installed the foundation stone, we do not wish to go back. We shall construct the Temple and Residential Quarters as we see fit. But we cannot follow their dictation. The idea is that the land, both vacant and occupied, must be given in a real charitable mentality, not to take advantage of our ability and get a temple and then create some trouble. This is not at all possible. We are also prepared to purchase the main land with garden and building by paying the the fixed price. If they are not interested in selling, we can accept charity. But in either case we can allow the two sisters to live in one portion of the building as devotees.

On these grounds you should make a document and do the needful.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
