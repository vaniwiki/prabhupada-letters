My dear Niranjana:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 12th of March and I have examined the contents with care. I think because I am travelling so much there is some problem in your letters reaching me. But now I want to leave so much travelling up to my able disciples and finish my translating work. So in a few days I am going to Bombay and then to London by the 1st, and then to L.A. via New York stopover.

Yes, I am sorry that I could not see you this year at the Mayapur celebration, it was very successful. But anyway because you are in college please take this opportunity to convince some of your fellow students about this Krsna consciousness. All over the world there are college students who are joining our movement, why not in India? Actually there is no need to give up studies to be a devotee. In America, a number of our students joined with us before they graduated but still they went on to graduate with honors, namely Bhagavan dasa, Trivikrama Maharaja, and others. So just try to convince them in some way.

Incidentally, I did not receive any contribution from Prabhas on your behalf at Mayapur.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
