My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter dated 17, Dec. duly in hand. I am preparing the text in dictaphone for sending you as usual, but you must have a dictaphone there, otherwise how you can hear the tapes? So arrange for this, either one to hire or on purchase system. And as soon as you let me know that you have one dictaphone there, I will send you the tapes regularly.

I have already written to Rayarama about Lord Caitanya's Teachings, that there is no need of editing the final manuscripts. Better let us prepare for its printing. He had some correspondence with Dai Nippon Printing Company of Tokyo, and our Dvarakadhisa did all the negotiation. Please contact him immediately, and ask him to send me the correspondence he had with the printing company.

I also do not like too much editorial work. This too much editorial work on Gitopanisad has created some misunderstanding between the editorial staffs. Anyway, in future, one man should edit it and be sufficient for our printing. And I do not want that Lord Caitanya's Teachings should be edited again and typed again and waste time in that way. I have also informed Rayarama of this, and you can also inform him like this. The book should be printed immediately without any waste of time. That is my desire.

Regarding Boston and Harvard University Kirtana, I quite appreciate your noble activities. Our Kirtana movement is genuine, and if the unsophisticated students take it seriously, it will be a great achievement. I know that all these Bogus Yogis they are cheating the public, but at the same time your countrymen also want to be cheated. They are cheating the public by words of extravagancy, saying that anyone can meditate even he is a drunkard. These cheap words attract people and these rascals become popular. So we don't want cheap popularity; I was very glad to learn from Gargamuni that Brahmananda refused to place my identification with so many cheater Swamis. We shall always remain distinct from all these cheaters. If we can convert one person in Krishna consciousness, that is our success of life. We don't want too many rascal followers. Let us perform this movement sincerely with faith in Krishna and people will gradually appreciate our service.

I thank you very much once more for your ardent desire to cooperate with my missionary work. Krishna will make you happy.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
