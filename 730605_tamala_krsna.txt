My dear Tamala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6-1-73, and have noted the contents carefully.

Yes, Mrs. Gandhi should be informed of all these incidents, how our temple has been dismantled by the municipality.

So, what is the meaning of the recommendation of the standing committee that we should immediately be able to reconstruct at the cost of the municipality. Is it useless? I thought that the standing committee's resolution was final but from your letter it appears there is no meaning. What has happened to the new act of February 1973 declaring the tenant of the land to be considered proprietor or owner. Anyway, I have already written to Giriraja my opinion of what should be done.

Had it been the case of some Mohammedan, there would have been great riot. But Hindus are such cowards, therefore no action has been done.

Regarding Hrsikesa das, he may come here to Mayapur and I will discuss with him what his engagement shall be. He speaks fluent Bengali, so he may teach the local boys here at our school.

My health is improving slowly. Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
