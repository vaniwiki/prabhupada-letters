====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

Brooklyn

My dear Gargamuni Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated from El Paso, Texas and I have noted the contents. So I am glad to see that you are doing well. Similarly, now we are getting literature published all over the world. I just received very nice books in Swedish and also Italian __Isopanisad__ and similarly our __Bhagavad-gita__ is being prepared in Dutch language. And also our literatures are being received very nicely. Bhagavan das in Paris has reported that they are collecting $20,000 per week in literature distribution. Our __Bhagavad-gita__ in French language is being received very enthusiastically by the people, libraries and schools.

All other reports are also very good. Tamala Krsna is also distributing many big books and also magazines and having many college engagements. Here in India the government is beginning to give us facility for our men to remain here. I am here in Bombay and I am supervising the construction of our temple here. It is a very large project. The temple is larger than our Vrndavana temple. We are trying to get it done as quickly as possible.

I have just received a report from Mukunda in London that the Encyclopedia Brittanica wants to carry my biography article in their publication. So this is all welcome news. So I am very pleased by all of the progress, how you boys and girls are working very sincerely to push on this movement of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. The only difficulty is the fighting that is going on. Why there should be fighting in our society? This is not a good sign.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
