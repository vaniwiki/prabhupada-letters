Mayapur

My dear Bhavananda Goswami Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Since I posted my last letter to you and Jayapataka Maharaja, jointly it has been decided that I'm returning to India by the 22nd or 23rd of this month. I think you have already been informed by Karandhara Prabhu. The reason is my health is broken down.

Last time when I was in Calcutta, the great ayurvedic physician Bimalananda Tarkatirtha felt my pulse and he said there is something very wrong within me but I left the next day. Unfortunately since I have come to the Western countries beginning from Zurich (Switzerland) then to New York then Los Angeles, but everywhere the climate is not at all suitable for me. I have received one letter from Madhavananda who was instructed by the physician that I should come back to India immediately. So I am coming back, and I will stay at Mayapur. Last time when I was there I left with you some instruction namely fixing the closet doors, iron bars on the windows and I hope you have these all finished by this time as well as the toilet facilities. I was pleased to learn from Madhavananda that he collected Rs. 42,000/. in one month for Mayapur construction. I hope things are going on nicely without any scarcity of money.

Hoping this meets you in good health. More when we meet.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
