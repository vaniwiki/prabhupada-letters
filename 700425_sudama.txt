====== Letter to: Sudama ======

Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. Regarding Tosho Printing Company, what has happened?---it is very urgent.

I have not as yet received any reply whether these people are agreeable. I want to settle up this thing, so let me know definitely about their decision taken from them in writing. If our regular printing is done there, whether you will be able to supervise it? Either yourself or Bhurijana Prabhu, if you take this responsibility, it will be a great help. If you so desire, Brahmananda can also go there for some time to train you how to do this press management.

So kindly reply this letter. I am very much anxious to hear from you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Try to introduce Japanese BTG as soon as possible.
