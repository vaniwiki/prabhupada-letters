My dear Madhudvisa Swami

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 3rd, 1974 and have noted the contents. I have also received the enclosed pictures of the proposed house. I am thinking that you are a very sincere devotee. I am remembering that during my recent visit there in Australia how during the kirtana you were seeing to my personal and not letting anybody come forward and still leading the kirtana. When you begin the chanting, everybody becomes captivated, and you can go on without stopping. I feel happy that even after my departure, things will go on. I am happy that I have got so many sincere devotees who will carry on. That is my happiness.

I like Australia very much because of your book distribution. So sell books and secure money and purchase the house and pay BBT conveniently. From the photos it appears that the house is very nice and sufficient for the present. Still the convent was a better place, and Dr. Powell and the bishop of Melbourne could advise them why they are insisting on this point of dismantling the chapel. Anyway either of the houses you can secure.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
