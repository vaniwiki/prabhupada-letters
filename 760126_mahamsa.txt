My dear Mahamsa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram regarding the Nellore affair. I have already written you one letter on 18th January in this regard. The summary is, don't relax the conditions. We can either purchase for the price mentioned in the deeds or take in charity, but we cannot accept any conditions. My letter makes everything explicit. If they decline then try to acquire the land through Government because we have already installed the Foundation Stone.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
