My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May the 20th, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. So far your travelling party is concerned it will only work if Indians go out with you. The problem is that as soon as you go out of the city no one will speak English. If you simply chant and do not speak then that would be all right, but there must be some speaking. Because if there is no speaking everyone will say that we are just like Devanand's film. So to be very respectable, we must speak our philosophy, and that would be impossible for you in Hindi and other languages. So I do not think it is a very good plan for travelling outside of the big cities like Bombay. Concentrate yourself in Bombay. Take many men and go in the suburbs. You can travel up to 100 miles from Bombay to places like Thana, Poona, Ahmedabad, like that. Just purchase a monthly ticket on the train and travel in the Bombay area very extensively. Just like Ville Parle is a big city, so there are so many suburbs like that in Bombay. First you organize this program for widespread distribution in Bombay. In Bombay, the people have money but in the villages no one has got any money, so what is the use of going there for collecting for our Juhu project? Besides, our books are in English, and they can neither read them or purchase them. The money is in %%__%%. So organize your travelling party to go all around Bombay %%__%% distributing and collecting, and that will be the best %%___%% Tamala Krishna how he is doing in East India.

Bhagavan dasa in Detroit is trying for some cars %%__%%. Also , Hansadutta has got some very nice buses in Germany %%__%% has written to me that he can purchase one for sending to %%__%% there is need. but I do not think it is possible to drive %%__%% India by crossing over Pakistan, because the border has been %%__%% Anyway, in the near future we shall be dispatching some vehicle %%__%% India, but meanwhile you should concentrate on this plan of distributing books and magazines very extensively in Bombay area.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
