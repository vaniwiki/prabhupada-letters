====== Letter to: Advaita ======

My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your ketter dated November 17, 1969 with two enclosures of paper samples. So far as the paper for colored pictures, 80 lbs., and dust jacket, 100 lbs., I think it is quite suitable. But so far as the papers for the inside of the book, the paper which you have indicated, 50 lbs., is not suitable. It must be either 60 or 70 lbs. If 70 lbs. is too costly, then 60 lbs. is tolerable. But the paper must be white just like __TLC.__ The samples you have sent are not so nice a white color. So far as the other estimates, I think they are all right. The total expenditure submitted by you, $7,939---or say $8,000, is acceptable. The size as you have mentioned, 6 3/4 x 9 1/2, is also all right, and the pictures 48 in number and pages 352 is also all right. The quality of binding, get-up, texture, etc. is like __TLC,__ so you can arrange for its printing immediately.

I am very sorry to learn that our press is lying idle, and your remark in this connection that we have purchased the cart before the horse is appropriate. I have immediately asked Aravinda from Los Angeles, to go there for doing layout work. I have asked also Pradyumna why the composition work is going so slowly. I have received one letter from Satsvarupa also in this connection, so all the composition and layout work must now be centralized in the press. For editing, already Satsvarupa is there, and Hayagriva will send his editorial matters without any delay. The actual difficulty is composing and layout. Satsvarupa informs me that there is a girl, Palika Dasi, who is a good typist, and Satsvarupa also agrees to purchase another machine. So if possible, immediately purchase this composing machine and begin the composing work for __Krsna.__ Jayadvaita is also there and Aravinda will help in layout work. So far as the press lying idle, I would advise you to immediately print the paperback edition immediately. Originally you were going to print this, and I do not know why this program was cancelled. After this is done you can reprint the first volume of __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ because there is a need for more copies of this volume. So I do not know why the press is sitting idly and why the proposal for printing __TLC__ in softcover edition is put aside. Also, you mention that there is some lack of management, but I do not know why this should be since Brahmananda, yourself, and the others are there. Please inform me of the cost for reprinting __TLC.__ I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
