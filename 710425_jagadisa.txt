My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 16th April, 1971 and have noted the contents. I have seen the copy of the newsletter drawn up to send to influential people, etc. there in Canada and it is very nice. So you can send such newsletters to all our life members in India also. I have already instructed Bhagavan das in this connection and sent him a complete list of names and addresses. So you can take instructions from him and do the needful.

Yes, please offer my blessings to your good wife Laksmimoni and son Nimala Candra. Please make them ideal Krishna Conscious family members. That will be a great example for our society.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
