My dear Umapati,

Please accept my blessings. I understand that you have now gone to Santa Fe and trying to get a job there. And I hope Krishna will arrange for this. Do not be worried. Another boy, Christopher Fynn, may be going there very soon. So three together try to live peacefully and always discuss on the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, chant Hare Krishna in regular classes, and whenever the opportunity is there, go to the park as they are doing in Boston and New York, and getting good collection.

In this connection you can consult Hansadutta in New York, and Satsvarupa in Boston how they are successfully carrying on. Here also the Brahmacaris are chanting in the Expo, and the arrangement is they will get some lump sum of money, and they have already gotten $300.00. Hansadutta has also collected, by chanting, $150.00. So if there is no jobs at all, then you can fully engage yourself in Krishna's job by chanting in the parks and public places, and certainly Krishna will send you salaries. Krishna provides all living entities and why not his sincere devotees? Therefore, we have to become simply sincere in our Krishna Consciousness movement, and all other things will follow.

Hoping you are both well,

Your ever well-wisher\\
