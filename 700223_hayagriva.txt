My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14 February, 1970, and have noted the contents carefully. I am very glad to know that you have sent the final manuscript of __KRSNA__ book to Brahmananda and that it now reads very well. Thank you very much.

Regarding the chapter end tags, that information has already been sent to you with my last letter.

It is correct that Nanda, Krsna, the gopas, gopis, etc. left Gokula to move to Vrindaban. There is no discrepancy because the whole area of Mathura is known as Vrindaban. Every place there is known as Vrindaban, but there are different quarters.

Some of the Gopis were detained, not allowed to go to Krsna, we accept that the Gopis danced with Krsna anyway, and they went in their spiritual body. Whatever was detained was material body.

Regarding the speeches of Brahma and Nagapatni to Krsna, that is not their quoting, that is my quoting---therefore it is called the Bhaktivedanta purport. But it is not incompatible, as you have suggested, because the Bhagavad-gita existed long before.

Regarding your change of the title to "Kamsa Begins His Persecutions," it is alright. I am enclosing herewith a preface which I have written for the __Krsna__ book. Please edit it nicely and send one copy of the edited version back to me, and another to Brahmananda for printing.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
