My dear Dr. Karan-Singh,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you of one matter which may be of interest to you, namely that we have now got thousands of disciples and well-wishers in the Western countries and out of them many are desiring to travel to India in the near future, at least 200 persons at a time, to see all the temples, especially the Vaisnava temples. So Air India has got a cheap round-trip fare to India and we want to take advantage and bring hundreds of members of our society and others to see all of the temples, so what will be the arrangements?

You are the Minister for India of Civil Aviation and Tourism, so I think this news should be of special interest to your department. Now we are prepared to bring thousands of visitors to your country, but we need also your help and cooperation to do this in proper manner. Now we have created interest all over the world in Krsna and Vrndavana, for instance the Air India is using the Krsna theme in their advertising campaign, so we have created this atmosphere of interest in Krsna in the Western countries, and I think that cooperatively we may work together to increase the foreign tourism in our country of India. What will be the arrangement for foreigners to see the temples, will they be allowed or what is the situation for government sanction for foreigners to see the temples?

Now I am returning to India in middle of October, and I am coming first to Vrndavana and New Delhi for holding our second annual Bhagavata-dharma Discourses and Hare Krsna Festival, and if Krsna desires it, we may meet again at that time.

Hoping this meets you and your good wife in the very best of health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
