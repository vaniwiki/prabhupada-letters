My dear Tulsi das:

Please accept my blessings. Upon your request I accept the following as my disciples and their names are: Mihallais Gitsis---Nandagopa dasa; Jamie Cray---Mahapurusa dasa; Terry Dann---Priyatmaja dasa; and James Mason---Kamalanatha dasa.

I also accept the following disciples as twice born brahmanas. Devamrta dasa brahmacari and Gopiparanadhana das brahmacari. Their threads duly sanctified by me are enclosed. Please have the beads chanted upon by a GBC sannyasi and hold a fire sacrifice. The brahmanas should hear the gayatri mantra with the right ear from my recorded tape.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Also initiated are: Dan Richardson---Gopagopisvara dasa and Beatrice Matusow---Bahubhavini devi dasi.\\
