My Dear Devananda, 

Please accept my blessings. Since I have come from New Vrindaban I have not received any letters from you. I know you are silent worker, but I always remember you. I am very much thankful to you for your nice service. In the meantime you have got good opportunity for Deity worship. Do it nicely, and be happy. Whenever you have time you can write me. I shall be very glad to read your letters. Also, you should write articles for Back To Godhead. You are very intelligent boy, and writing will be a good manner for you to keep your intelligence engaged and doing nice preaching work.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
