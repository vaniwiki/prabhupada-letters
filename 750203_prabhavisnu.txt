London

My dear Prabha Visnu das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 18, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the question about selling records there, I have already told Hansadutta that it may continue temporarily until the stock is finished, but you must give a book with each record.

I will most probably be coming to London on March 2nd or 3rd after visiting South America. So, I will see you then.

Your picture of the London Deities is very nice. Thank you very much.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have just received your letter (signed by several persons) dated Jan. 27, 1975 and have noted the contents. Hansadutta will be coming there shortly. We shall decide about the permanent management arrangement when I come there in March.\\
