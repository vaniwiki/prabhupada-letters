My dear Mayapurusasa das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 9, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding this matter with your child, I cannot say, but at least I would not have agreed that the doctors perform this operation. In New York in 1968 when I was in the hospital they tried to operate my brain, but I left the hospital tactfully. Therefore I say that you never call a doctor for me or send me to the hospital. So it is up to you, but I would have not agreed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
