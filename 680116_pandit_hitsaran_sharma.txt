My dear Hitsaranji,

Please accept my blessings. I hope you have by this time received the check for 2000 rps. for purchase of paper. I am very happy to learn that you are helping Achyutananda and Ramanuga for their maintenance (maintainance) in Vrindaban.

We sent one order to S. S. Brijbasi and Co. last year in the month of April and paid them $125 in advance. They have acknowledged the money and promised to execute the order but still they have not done it. I know they are a very respectable firm, but why they are dealing like this? I cannot understand. I cannot expect that they would cheat us for $125; there must have been some misplacing of whole affair. If you will kindly inquire from them what is the whole situation and let us know, it will be great favor for us. We are very much astonished at their behavior.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
