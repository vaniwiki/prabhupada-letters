My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that one of our life members, Kanailall Taparia, has generously consented that we may use his place in Vrindaban. He has 12 rooms (10 are small and 2 are big), and they are located in the vicinity of Krishna Bhakti asrama in Raman Reti. You can make inquiries just where it is and survey the facilities.

Now there is some commotion about all the householders and children at the Temple so they can move there and we can use the 2 big rooms as a Gurukula for now. It does not matter that the land is not ours, that we can negotiate later, but we can utilize for the time being and negotiate later to purchase or not, or even he may contribute outright to us.

You can see the property and let me know promptly of the outcome. I shall send you a letter of authorization from Mr. Taparia in short time.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
