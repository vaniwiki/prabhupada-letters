My dear Aksayananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. For some time now it has been my desire that our students in India shall have the advantage of one or two trucks or vans for spreading this Krsna consciousness movement there. I have just now got one letter from Gargamuni Maharaja, and he has had a very, very good success in Gujarat State by driving one van which he has borrowed for one month only. In that letter he has requested very urgently that one van be provided immediately from the European centers. So I wish that combinedly you may all pool your resources and purchase one nice van. Furthermore, a few men will be required to take that van by driving it to India. So I am placing this matter in the hands of Hansadutta and he will do the needful. Now you all please cooperate with him as much as possible for procuring this dream of mine.

Hoping this will find you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
