My dear sons,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Karandhara, I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

__Michael McCloughlin,__

Rupa Manohara das (He whose form is all-enchanting)

__Paul League,__

Vipina Purandara das (the youthful boy of the forest)

__Richard Roland,__

Brajera Pakhala das (He who tends the calves of Vraja)

__Eddie Dougherty,__

Gopavrndapala das (protector of the cowherd boys)

__David Hardin,__

Kadambakanana das (He who plays in the groves where the kadamba flower grows)

I am so glad to learn that all of you have been such a great help to Karandhara there in our Los Angeles center. I can understand that all of you are very sincere boys, and are very eligible candidates for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street sankirtana and book distribution, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end you will reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
