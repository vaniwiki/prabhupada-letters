====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated September 28 and October 2, 1972.

As you are unable to meet me in the Philippines, that is all right since I first wanted to hear from you that everything in your zone was going all right, and it appears from your letter that you are persevering in the attempt to spread Krishna Consciousness movements to the people of Australia. That new devotees are coming is the sign of our success.

I will be in India up to April 1972, then I can go to South Africa, or if you like, to Australia. My immediate program in India will be for one month at Radha Damodara Temple in Vrndavana up till November 15, where we shall be holding class on the Nectar of Devotion.

Hoping you are in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
