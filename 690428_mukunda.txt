My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much perturbed in mind that you are living scattered with the others. The letter which I have written to Gurudasa is sent herewith in a carbon copy. As you will find in that letter, I am prepared to give a letter of guarantee of the Bank of America to the authorities of the mortuary building up to the extent of $15,000. So you must occupy that house at any rate. If George Harrison's letter of guarantee is not sufficient, then I am also prepared to guarantee for $15,000. Let them know that we are not paupers. If need be, you can show the authorities my latest bank balance in Bank of America. Enclosed is the latest note, dated 21, April 1969. This can be increased to $15,000 without any difficulty. So complete the transaction, and the house may be occupied immediately.

Please convey my blessings to the others also. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. You can also let them know that I am permanent resident of the U.S.A. immigrant as Ordained Minister of Religion with fifteen branches all over the states.

Also you can ask Brahmananda to send "TLC" which is now received and it is far superior quality book than anyone is get-up all binding. ACB
