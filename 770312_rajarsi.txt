My dear Rajarsi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 21st, 1977.

Personal service to the spiritual master means to follow his instructions. My request is the same for everyone: that they follow strictly the regulative principles and chant at least sixteen rounds daily. And as much time as they are able should be devoted for preaching according to our books. So you and your wife should try to follow this instruction.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
