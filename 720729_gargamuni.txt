[ The condition of this letter is very poor. ]

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter from Dvaraka dated July 17, 1972, and with great pleasure I have noted the contents. I am very glad to hear that your Sankirtana party is having such great success all over Gujarat province and I am very much pleased upon you. This is actually Lord Caitanya's movement, this Sankirtana party for preaching and chanting. So do it nicely, and I shall try to help you as much as possible.

Hansadutta has promised to arrange for getting one German van for your party in India, and he will send some men there by driving it to India very soon. If so many men are coming forth to offer you all cooperation, why not take collection from them for new slide projector? That is not very big thing, so I think you can manage. In Bombay they have got very big work to collect for their Juhu building scheme, so they may not be bothered %%___%% small thing of slide-projector, but I have requested Giriraja %%___%% give you all cooperation and whatever you want you give %%__%% and I am enclosing one copy of that letter to Giriraja. %%__%% likewise must also try to assist him and work together %%___%% for the success of our mission as a whole, not that %%___%% is more important than another---they are all important %%____%% work in that spirit and do the needful for pushing %%____%% all over the world progressively, you have got %%_____%%

The murti is already installed, and you %%______%% etc. I have already told you to do it. So %%___%% %%____%% to help you, why is this still going on? %%_______%% But anyway I have written to Giriraja and we %%________%% prove. But one thing is, cooperation takes %%___%% %%____%% if we always see that it is my defect if no %%________%% me. In this spirit, try to woo Giriraja into %%________%% also help you both.

Yes, start a center in Dvaraka immediately %%____%% achievement for us. Subala can join you immediately %%___%% not needed in Delhi.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
