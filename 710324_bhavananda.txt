====== Letter to: Bhavananda ======

Brooklyn

My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. The enclosed letter may be handed over to Mr. J. Mukherjee which speaks for itself. In any case we are not able to help him with passage money for returning to India.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
