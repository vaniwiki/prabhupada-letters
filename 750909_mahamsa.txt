My dear Mahamsa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 6, 1975 with enclosed photos of the farm. I like that place and wish to go there. As soon as you call me I will come. If this scheme is successful, it will be a great fortune for us to capture Indian ideals and the support of the Government. Yes, Hansadutta can supply Rs. 2 lakhs for irrigation. Also I am asking that he may request that English devotees may be sent. The Nature Cure Hospital as you have described it is all right.

Regarding the libraries taking the books, they can be given up to 25% discount. We shall take a standing order from them, and supply whatever we can, and the balance by and by.

Yes, you can rotate the profits from the milk products and agriculture for future developments.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I wish to make an experiment in preaching by bullock cart. One cart can hold 6-8 men sitting and 2 men for sleeping.\\
