Dear Sri Kanungo:

Please accept my blessings, and offer the same to your good wife Srimati Chhavi Kanungo. I am staying now at Mayapur at the above address, and I was very much eager to see you in connection with your land that you have donated to our Society. Now we have to make a program how to develop the place to make it a nice preaching center in Orissa, and for this purpose your cooperation is much required.

I therefore want to see you personally, and it will be a great pleasure for me if you both husband and wife come here. It is a very nice place, and you will like to remain here for one or two days. I hope you can come here, accompanied by one of our men from Calcutta.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
