====== Letter to: Visnujana ======

Houston

My dear Visnujana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your encouraging letter dated 1st February, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. The pamphlet enclosed by you is very nice and I am translating it into Hindi. You have very diligently collected all the purports in Srimad-Bhagavatam and have presented very nicely our missionary activities, especially in reference to religion, politics, and sociology. Actually we want to establish a transcendental human society in which everything will be perfectly done so that man will be happy in this life as well as the next. All pamphlets and leaflets are well selected and if you simply preach the message contained in that literature, that will be sufficient stock to deliver to the people in general.

I am so glad that you are developing the center in Houston Texas and now have gone to Austin Texas to open yet another center. If you think so, I can send Deities for installing in the Houston temple. Any boy recommended by you will be initiated. I am also contemplating to return to the U.S.A. by the month of April.

Your program there sounds very nice and Krishna is helping you by sending more devotees. The more you render service, Krishna will help you more and more. My only desire is that all my sannyasi disciples may increase this institution in a wide area. So write me and let me know how things are developing. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
