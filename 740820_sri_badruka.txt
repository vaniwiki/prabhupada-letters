====== Letter to: Sri Badruka ======

Hyderabad

My dear Sri Badruka:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 7, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am very pleased to hear about the progress of Hyderabad centre preaching and construction. With your active interest I am very confident that everything is going on very smoothly.

I have sent to Mahamsa Swami Rs. 60,000/- so that the immediate construction may not be hampered. In the meantime please see that the life members there start collecting.

If the temple is completed by next Janmastami, I will be pleased to come to inaugurate the opening.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
