My dear Abhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter sent through Bhagavan das dated 30th June, 1970, and the contents are very encouraging. I am so glad to know that you are an intelligent boy, happily married and now engaged in advancement of Krsna consciousness under the careful guidance of Sriman Bhagavan das. Please continue to study very thoroughly our Krsna consciousness way of spiritual life and with the help of Bhagavan das become more and more fixed up in the service of Lord Krsna.

I am very happy to accept you as my disciple as you have requested and your spiritual name is Abhirama Das Adhikari. Abhirama means one who is inclined to worship Lord Rama. I have chanted your beads duly and they are returned to you enclosed herewith. Please follow the rules and regulations for progressive spiritual advancement and be sure to chant regularly sixteen rounds of Hare Krsna mantra daily. I am enclosing one sheet listing standard practices for devotees and ten offenses to avoid in the matter of chanting the Holy Names.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
