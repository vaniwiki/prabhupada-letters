My dear Krsna das,

Please accept my blessings. Since a long time I have not heard from you, so I will be glad to hear from you about your temple and Sankirtana activities.

I was informed that Hansadutta was going to Berlin. Whether he has gone there?

So please drop me a line or two about your center activities, Hope this will meet you in good health. Please offer my blessings to Hansadutta, Himavati, Jaya Govinda, Sadanandini, Sivananda, Vasudeva, Natabara, Haripriya, Vrndadevi, Sucandra, Heidrun, Mandali Bhadra, and all the other boys and girls there.

What is being done about French and German magazines?

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
