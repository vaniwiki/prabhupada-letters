My dear Tulsi Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and I thank you very much for it. I am so glad to hear how your Sankirtana programs are expanding, so continue in this way. So far as book distribution is concerned, this program should also be given much energy. Also for distributing our books we have initiated the life membership program. This program has been very successful here in India. If you can develop it nicely there in San Diego, it will be a great asset to your preaching work. So cooperate with Karandhara Prabhu and develop it nicely.

Presently we are in Gorakhpur, one of the important cities in Northern India, and we are guests of the Gita Press authorities. Here we are negotiating for a plot of land on the University of Gorakhpur campus for establishing a center. If we are successful in our attempt, it will be unique in all the world and soon more and more college campuses will follow. We want to influence these misguided college students so that they might take to this Krishna Consciousness Movement very seriously. And if we can establish a seat of Krishna Consciousness these students may take their doctorate degree in Krishna Consciousness and go out and preach all over the world. From here I shall be going to Mayapur and then to Bombay, and should be returning to U.S.A. by the first week of April. Please offer my blessings to Sandy, Pat, Bill and Jeff Prabhus, and all the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
