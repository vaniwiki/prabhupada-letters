My dear Madhavananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter hand delivered by Brahmananda Swami. I have written to Saurabha Prabhu to send you the same pattern plans for your temple construction. You should build in the same pattern, not different. More when we meet soon.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
