Hyderabad

My dear Mahamsa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram which read as follows: MISSED YOUR GRACE BY HOURS AGREEMENT DRAFT FOR FARM LAND SENT TO YOU PLEASE SANCTION RS 30,000 URGENT TRANSFER TO PREPARE FOR UTILIZING THIS MONSOON -MAHAMSA SWAMI. But, I have not received the draft copy as informed by you. Regarding the money, rs. 30,000, of course, if need be, it must be paid, but one thing is that you must be very careful that our temple portion must be completed by Janmastami so that the Deity can be moved there. This is very important that the temple portion be completed by Janmastami. Whatever money was available, I have given 1-1/2 lakhs to Jayapataka Swami and 2 lakhs to Giriraja. So, you have to take this money from Giriraja. Please arrange like that and let me know what is the progress of Hyderabad activities at my Honolulu address: 51 Coelho Way, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
