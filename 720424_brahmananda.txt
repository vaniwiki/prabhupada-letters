My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to receive your letters of April 6th and 15th, 1972, and I have noted the contents. You have got great responsibility in Africa, greater than in India. As you are concentrating your activities in Africa with Mr. Shah and Damji Devji, there is no need to return to India at the present moment. I have received one report from Bombay that things are going on nicely, so unless there is urgent necessity I shall not want you to go back to India. Rsi Kumar was anxious to go to S. Africa. I have already advised him to go to South Africa and if he's still willing I wish that he may be helped in that respect. My desire is that you be in charge of East Africa and he may be in charge of South Africa, and this way you both organize the African program very nicely.

Just now I am on the plane towards Hong Kong (Apr. 19th), where I shall stay overnight, and tomorrow I shall go to Japan. Our preaching in Australia and New Zealand was very successful, and in New Zealand we shall very soon have our own temple, as our new disciple there, Gaura Krishna das, has already given 3 acres of land in Auckland.

I am very glad to note that you are increasing always by enrolling many Life Members. That is the heart of our expanding progress in Africa, making Life Members, so go on like this and make many many hundreds and thousands of Life Members in Africa.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
