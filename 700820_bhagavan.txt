====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

Detroit

My dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 14th, 1970, and noted the contents carefully. The reports of your meeting are very encouraging, so try to purge out the contamination, which has entered our Society, uprootedly.

It has been arranged that we are going to Calcutta on 29th August and our Calcutta address is as follows: ISKCON; 37/1 Hindustan Road; Ballyganj; Calcutta-29.

I hope you have received the circular letter which was sent to each member of the GBC for reporting me the work going on in his jurisdiction. I do not know in whose direction is our New York Temple. I have received no report from New York since a long time. So if it is in your jurisdiction you may kindly inform me what is going on there. Other reports are very encouraging. Keep your schedule nicely, then there will be very little chance of Maya to creep inside.

Maya is on the back side of Krsna and if we keep ourselves always in front side of Krsna, engaged in His service, then the external energy on the back side of Krsna will not be able to attack us. These things are very nicely explained in First Volume, 27th Chapter, Srimad-Bhagavatam.

As far as the marriages are concerned, I have got all blessings, but the girls must be younger than the boys.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
