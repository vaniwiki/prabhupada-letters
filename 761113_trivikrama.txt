Taipei, Taiwan

My dear Trivikrama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 25, 1976.

I'm very glad to hear about the good response you are getting in Taiwan. Krsna is blessing you. You have taken a bold step. Krsna will help you. My blessings are with you. Do your best, surely you'll be successful. Print books and distribute. For now there is no need of opening temples.

If you can go to the mainland that will be the greatest mercy of Krsna. Once we can set the fire of Krsna consciousness in the country, there will be spontaneous combustion.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
