My dear Nicholas,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 11 March, 1977.

Your proposal for arranging a Gita on tapes in different languages for distributing all over the world is very good. You may contact my representative, His Holiness Harikesa Swami, at:

6241 Schloss Rettershof

uber Konigstein

Taunus, West Germany\\
and arrange everything with him.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
