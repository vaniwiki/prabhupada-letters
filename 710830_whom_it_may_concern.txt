To Whom It May Concern:

This is to certify that Sriman Bhagavan das Adhikari is an ordained minister in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, of the title Bhakti-sastri, and fully qualified to instruct on Krishna Consciousness and Vedic literature in general. He has been studying under me for many years and is one of my foremost disciples.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
