My dear Pradyumna, Satsvarupa and Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letters but have no time to reply them in detail as I am busy making hasty preparations to leave for the USA. I shall arrive on 24th November, 12:45 P.M. San Francisco time.

Killing proposal is not good. We have to kill them with arguments and reasons not with sticks and weapons.

Jadurani---I am very glad that you want to kill the non-devotees. You should, however, leave the matter to your good God-brothers who will take care of it. I am pleased to learn of your spirit of protest, but sometimes we have to tolerate. Hope you are well

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
