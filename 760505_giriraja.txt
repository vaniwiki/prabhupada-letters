====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

Bombay

My dear Giriraja das,

Please accept my blessings. Herewith please find one copy of a letter to the Central Bank of India, Gowalia Tank Road Branch, Bombay. I sent one bank draft to them by registered post. See that the transaction is executed and have the funds entered in the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust passbook.

On Yasodanandana Swami's plea, I have sent him Rs. 15,000/- care of the Hyderabad Temple. This will be used for printing books by Yasodanandana Swami in South India.

Now, I originally owed Rs. 59,000/-, and I sent 2 telegraphic transfers totalling Rs. 23,654/32 from Melbourne, Australia (see my letter dated 27th April, 1976 to you). So this left the balance at Rs. 35,345/68. However, I gave you Rs. 5,000/- when I (by transfer also) was in Bombay, so the remainder is Rs. 30,345/68. Now, this check for U.S. $2,871.45 is approximately Rs. 25,411/06 at the rate given here of U.S. 11.3 cents equals one rupee. So this leaves the balance at Rs. 4,934/62. This amount will be paid by Yasodanandana Swami. He will give Rs. 5,000/- towards the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust account 16066, and the remainder of the loan, Rs. 10,000/- will be paid into my personal account at the Punjab National Bank, Krishna Balarama Mandir branch, savings fund account number 1. In this way he can repay the loan of Rs. 15,000/- and my debt to the BBT will thus be cleared.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
