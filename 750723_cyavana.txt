My dear Cyavana Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 2, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am glad to see that you are working enthusiastically there in Africa to spread Lord Caitanya's movement. This I want. It is especially important that you train up the Africans there. Do this carefully.

Now I have received one letter from Bhakti Mati and she has some complaint. She also says there was some physical attack against Navayogendra. This is not good. So I think they can open a separate temple in Mombassa for the Asian community. The Africans and the Asians will not like to mix. So there is no harm in opening separate temples. Both will preach Krishna consciousness and the kirtanas will go on. So do like that.

Regarding your questions, you have to decide amongst yourselves if Jagad-guru is to come, but if you require his assistance since Brahmananda Swami is not there, that is different thing. Yes, there can be a separate bank account for Spiritual Sky. The idea of the travelling ship seems a bit utopian, but at the next GBC Mayapur meeting it can be thoroughly discussed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
