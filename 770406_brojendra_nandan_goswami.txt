My dear Brojendra Nandan Goswami,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1-4-77.

You are already known to Akshayananda Maharaj and Jagadisha Prasad so you can see them and do the needful.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
