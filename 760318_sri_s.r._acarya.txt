Dear Sriman Acarya,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your postcard dated 10-3-76 and I am very much pleased that a learned scholar like you is prepared to cooperate with our preaching activities. If you kindly come in Calcutta* on the 22nd or 23rd March, 1976, at any time between 10-12 in the morning, or 5-7 in the evening along with your papers, I shall be very glad to meet you and talk with you on the subject matter.

Thanking you.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
