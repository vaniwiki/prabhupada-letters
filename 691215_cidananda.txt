My dear Cidananda,

Please accept my blessings. I was very much anxious to hear from you since I did not receive any letter for a long time. So your letter dated December 7, 1969 is very encouraging and welcome. Since you have gone to Vancouver things have improved very nicely. Now we are going to print 50,000 __BTG__s per month, so try to increase the sales as far as possible.  Sankirtana and distributing BTG and our other literatures is the fieldwork of this movement. Temple worship is secondary. People are invited to come to the temple to see the behavior of the devotees specifically in the matter of purification. There are two kinds of purification methods, external and internal. In our Krishna Consciousness Movement, Deity worship helps to keep us externally purified and Sankirtana helps to keep us internally purified. So as far as possible we shall execute both of these processes simultaneously. And by your exemplary character, the general mass of people will be benefited. Our hearts in material condition are filled with all dirty things, and this Krishna Consciousness Movement is the cleansing process.

I am very glad that your feasts are becoming very successful. Yesterday I received a letter from Hawaii that they are now receiving about 100 guests and they are charging $1.00 each. So now they have a good income. You may know that Gaurasundara was forcibly sent to Hawaii, by now he and his wife are both doing very nice propaganda. Please offer my blessings to Ravindra, who is working so nicely for Krishna Consciousness. Krishna will certainly be pleased upon him and his life will be sublime. Just make your center still more established, and when you are prepared to install Deities in a nice place, certainly I shall go. I have never seen Vancouver, and from Los Angeles it is not far away. So let us hope for that future date. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
