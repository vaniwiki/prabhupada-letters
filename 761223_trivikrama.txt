My dear Trivikrama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 9, 1976.

Your description of how you are distributing Bhagavad-gita is very nice. Follow that principle. There is no need of sannyasa dress. Organize this system all over Southeast Asia and distribute as many books as possible. I think that in Taiwan the Chinese people are very friendly to the Americans.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
