My dear Locanananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 17, 1975 and am very pleased to read the contents. I have also received the copies of the Dutch pamphlet. The get up is very nice. I thank you very much. The picture of Krsna on the inside front cover is very nice. It is very natural. Krsna is so young, and I see on the following page that everyone is getting old. That is the difference of the spiritual world and the material world. On the whole this pamphlet is very nice.

Regarding your proposal for printing the condensed version of Bhagavad-gita, yes, do it. From your figures of book distribution you are doing __real__ preaching. Which books are you distributing? Your prasadam program is also very important. Continue it. By chanting and giving prasadam you will get so many devotees. Yes, as you say the purity is attractive to people. Continue it. Our only asset is our purity. __pavitram paramam bhavam.__ You cannot reach Krsna without being pure, because He is the supreme pure. Yes, on my next visit to Europe, I will certainly visit your temple.

Upon your recommendation, I accept the following as my initiated disciples and their names are: Henk van Teylingen---Hayesvara dasa; Gabriel Sebach---Gabhiratma dasa; Ernesto Lucifero---Ekatma dasa.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. The translation work of Bhagavad-gita in Dutch language is very important work. Do it nicely.\\
