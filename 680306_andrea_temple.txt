My dear Andrea Temple,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter post-dated March 4, 1968, and I thank you very much for it. Your work in spreading Krishna Consciousness there is very much pleasing to me, and I am always glad to hear more from you. As I said in my last letter to you, I shall come there whenever you like; simply you must send me plane tickets, and I shall come. If you could arrange for speaking engagements that is very nice. I am leaving this place for San Francisco on the 8th of March, and as you like, I can fly from S.F. to Bahama Islands sometimes in March or April; we can make further arrangements as to the exact day after I return to S.F. You may show the woman in charge of the club our recent article in Life magazine if you like, which was published on Feb. 9, 1968, page 56.

Yes, whoever you tell the chant to, it is effective. You have heard it from me and my disciples, similarly I have heard it from my Guru Maharaja, and so on, and on. Because you have heard it from a pure devotee of the Lord, therefore it is transmitted from you to another. Just as an aerial message, is transmitted from one place to another, similarly, this Guru parampara system is working. My disciples are my agents, my representatives, so by hearing it from them, you are receiving it from me. And because you are a sincere soul, those who are hearing the Mantra from you are receiving it in disciplic succession, from Lord Caitanya and from Lord Krishna.

Yes, I can perform spiritual weddings for my initiated disciples. I have gotten so many young devotees married, and they are executing Krishna Consciousness nicely. That is the real purpose of married life; to live together peacefully, execute Krishna Consciousness, bring up children in Krishna Consciousness, so they will not again have to enter into this world of birth and death.

Govinda dasi has read me your letter and your place sounds very nice. It is all right that you do not have a storefront at present time; simply we need some space, and your house will do very nicely. Before I come there, you should please make large advertising campaign so that many people may come to our Kirtana. Perhaps you could order some fairly large quantity literature and propaganda from New York, and distribute in your city. Also, maybe the radio or T.V. stations may become interested if you approach them with our various propaganda, news clippings, and so forth. You can write to Brahmananda in this connection, and he can give you instructions how to do it. We must try to catch the attention of as many people as possible; so that some may come and hear us, and be benefited. If it is possible, perhaps you can begin this propaganda work as soon as possible, and have regular scheduled Kirtana, so that people may start coming even before my arrival. That would be very nice.

Please continue your very good missionary work, and keeping us informed. I hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. We have received a large consignment of books (Srimad-Bhagavatam) and musical instruments for Kirtana. You can negotiate with Brahmananda at N.Y.
