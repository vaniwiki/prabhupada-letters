My dear Krpasindhu (Rick Holtzman),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter dated 7th July, 1971 and you will be glad to know that I have accepted you as my duly initiated disciple. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and are being returned personally by Jagadisa Prabhu, who is here now in N.Y. I have given you the spiritual name Krpasindhu Das Brahmacari. Krpasindhu means Krishna, the ocean of mercy.

I am so glad to note how you have been following the regulative principles strictly for the past six months and chanting at least 16 rounds of beads daily, as well as going in Sankirtana regularly. Thank you very much. That is our very strength in spiritual life and if you continue to do so, along with reading all our literatures and attending classes and aratis, then your rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness will be certain. So my request to you is that you work very enthusiastically and in cooperation with Jagadisa Prabhu and make our Toronto center a grand success.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
