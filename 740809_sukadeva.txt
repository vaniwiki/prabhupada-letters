My dear Sukadeva das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 2, 1974 and have noted the contents. You have mentioned that you want to write a book, but instead of writing books, you should read and explain my books to others. Reading and writing are the same, sravanam kirtanam vishnoh.

You say that Krsna is sending you only one new devotee every six months, but He says in the Bhagavad gita that out of millions of men one only becomes a devotee. You have sent a list of six men for initiation, so why you are disappointed? Do not think of changing the place. Stick to that place and chant Hare Krishna. Krsna will send more men, rest assured. Devotees may come or not come, but you do your duty.

The men you have recommended I accept as my disciples, and their name are as follows:

John Philion---Jyotiraditya dasa

Shannon Philion---Sarada

Sherman Alston---Shasta dasa

Karen Alston---Krsnapriya dasi

Eric Thomas---Aja dasa

John Rowe---Jagadadija dasa

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
