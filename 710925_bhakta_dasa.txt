My dear Bhakta Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14th September, 1971 and have noted the contents. Also I have received the two sacred threads enclosed and they have been duly chanted by me. At your recommendation Paratrikananda, Surya das, Annapurna and Lilasakti may all be given Gayatri mantra. Enclosed please find four copies. The procedure for initiation should be as follows: First of all secure the tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra, either from Karandhara in L.A. or from Jayananda in Berkeley. Then you can hold a fire yajna. Then the devotees should hear the tape individually, privately, and through the right ear. They should repeat each word. Then you get the threads on the boys' bodies.

So far purchasing the new temple is concerned, if Karandhara feels that it is better to wait for some time before purchasing then it is all right with me.

New devotees are coming. That is a sign of your sincerity. Krishna is sending. And you are distributing over 1000 BTG per week. That is most encouraging. Maintain this program and you can be sure that Krishna will give you a new temple very soon.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
