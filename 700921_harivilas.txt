====== Letter to: Harivilas ======

My dear Harivilas,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 15th, 1970, the contents of which have given me great satisfaction. Sriman Hanuman has already arrived here in Calcutta and from the pictures he has shown me of your temple and devotees I can understand that everything is going on very nicely there.

I think Krishna is giving you good intelligence to manage everything in Paris. Everyone should be kept fully engaged one hundred percent of the time in Krishna’s service without a vacant moment so that Maya will never have a chance to act. It does not matter what one’s engagement in Krishna’s service may be; Krishna accepts equally the service given to Him by a little calf and that given by Srimati Radharani. So we should all be very much appreciative of our God-brothers’ and Godsisters’ service. I am glad that Aradhana and Santanu are engaged in painting pictures. As we open more temples there is a greater and greater need for paintings. So they can paint as many as possible pictures of Panca Tattva and Acharyas and distribute them to all the new temples---this will be a great service to our society.

I am glad to learn your Sankirtan Party is going to all the areas of the city each time out. Here also the Samkirtan Party lead by Madhudvisa Maharaj is having great success and sometimes as many as four hundred business and working men join them in chanting Hare Krishna on the streets. It is all Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s Mercy that this is happening all around the world and we should pray to Him that he may benedict us with even greater opportunity to spread His Samkirtan Movement. Please continue your search for a suitable temple building and Krishna will help you in this also.

I have instructed Tamal Krishna to write you also. He has received your letter.

Please offer my blessings to all the Paris Prabhus. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
