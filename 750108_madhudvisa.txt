My dear Madhudvisa Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 16th, 1974 and have noted the contents. We can have the installation there in May if you think it is wiser.

I have accepted Bhakta Wayne and Bhakta Rod as my firstly initiated disciples. Their names are as follows: Venugopala and Ramasaran. Also I have accepted Antaratma dasa, Ramai dasa, Gunavati dasi, and Camari dasi as duly initiated brahmanas. Their threads and mantra sheets are enclosed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
