Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one letter from Madhavananda in which he mentions that the Deities at the Bhaktivedanta Manor are not protected. So you are the president of the Temple and therefore you are responsible for all areas. Who is in charge of the Deity room? It must be secured at night, every window and door must be locked and you must personally see to this. You have had sufficient experience at Bury Place that the Deity was attacked. You have already experienced that so you should not be negligent in this matter. Please see that adequate security is given to the Temple, especially to the Deities, so that They will not be exposed to any attack. I have answered Madhavananda on various points so you may see his letter. The main thing is that if the matter is to go ahead there must be a cooperative spirit between yourself, Madhavananda, Syamasundara and the others. I understand from Madhavananda's letter that there is great opportunity for spreading Krsna Consciousness among the Indians and expanding all our programs there in England so I shall be glad to hear from you on these matters how you are pushing forward to make our mission successful in England.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
