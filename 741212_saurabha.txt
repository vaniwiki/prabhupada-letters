My dear Saurabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 1, 1974 and have noted the contents. Thank you for supplying the account for the money which has been sent to you. I am encouraged that you expect to have the everything completed on time. This I want.

I am glad to note that you have two more contractors, not to be dependent upon one is better. It is also good that local men like Visvambar are taking part.

I am starting for Hawaii on Saturday next and shall return to India at end of next February or early March.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
