My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated May 22, and May 26, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very encouraged to learn of your very nice Sankirtana success in Boston. One thing though you are thinking of quitting your job, that means you are already in the job, so if in spite of your working, your Sankirtana Movement is going on nicely, why you should give up your job? But if you think by giving up your job the Sankirtana Party will be organized more nicely, then you can do that.

Regarding Jadurani, if she does not improve in a month or two, then she will come back and live with you, chanting Hare Krishna and depending on Krishna. Don't bother; Krishna will take care of her. I don't think that she is very dangerously ill because her face indication was not bad. But after all, we have got these material bodies, and some temporary ailments may come and go, but we have to tolerate. But in all cases, you must find out a nice place as temple, either by purchasing or by renting. If you think that advancing $10,000 will get a nice house, then you can find out and we may find out the money. But first you must let me know how you shall repay. If you purchase one house, even you make down payment of $10,000, you have to make monthly payments of $300 or $400. So these things are to be considered. But if you can find a nice house which will accommodate all the householders and brahmacaris, then that will be very good. But do not take on any big responsibilities now. Concentrate on organizing Sankirtana very nicely and try to sell __Back To Godhead.__ That is our main propaganda. It is very encouraging that you are daily collecting about $50. Now you have got a nice carriage, and thus you can go anywhere you like. Try to keep nice peace with the police as far as possible, because our method is to be tolerant more than the tree and humbler than the grass on the street. We don't mind for so-called prestige. If keeping peaceful we can execute our Krishna Consciousness duties, that is all we want.

Regarding the manuscripts which Pradyumna requested you to send him, first of all let Pradyumna get the machine. Then I shall advise. For the time being you keep it as you have been doing. I shall let you know in due course. Two __Krishna__ tapes have been recently sent to you, so you shall receive them soon, if you have not done so already. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
