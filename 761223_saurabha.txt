====== Letter to: Saurabha ======

Los Angeles

My dear Saurabha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12/12/76.

I have no objection to your going to visit your family and then to Los Angeles to discuss the doll exhibitions for the planetarium.

Yes, make this guesthouse the most beautiful building in Bombay. You have got the credit for Vrindaban, now take the credit for Bombay. Your service will be commemorated as long as the buildings remain. Krsna will shower all blessings for your long life and spiritual advancement. Perhaps when you come back you can take the still more wonderful Mayapur project. One thing, making the hallways Kotastone is not good. It has no aristocratic value. Why not tiles? Of course, as you decide. This is my suggestion. I think Kotastone pavement is no better than cement pavement.

Yes, the management must be very first class. If required we can keep some paid men. Amateur management is not always efficient. I approve of your ideas for management. We shall get it passed by resolution meeting. I like the ideas.

Keep in contact with Mr. Kitumera. His help may be required. Yes, you may keep thinking about the Mayapur planetarium.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
