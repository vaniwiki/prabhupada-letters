My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter dated July 17, 1972, and I am very much pleased to understand from you that your Deity program, the Chicago program, and all other programs in our mid-western U.S.A. zone are very much improving more and more under your management. So far Chicago temple is concerned, they may install Deities later. First let them preach. Preaching is the first thing, and when there is experience then I can install Deities. So far the St. Louis chapter is concerned, let Vamanadeva live there peacefully husband and wife, why he should go away? That will be all right if he installs his Radha-Krsna Deities from his home. I am also happy to hear that the Gurukula project has been given help by Karandhara and others, so that cooperatively we may demonstrate the topmost example of real education in the world. Now you go on preaching with full vigor and determination, keep our standard of Krsna Consciousness always at the highest level, and remain sincere always by remembering Krsna, through vibrating of His holy name.

Hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
