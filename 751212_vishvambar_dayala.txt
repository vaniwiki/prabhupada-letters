My dear Vishvambar Dayala,

Please accept my blessings. I acknowledge receipt of donation* from your mother Srimati Narayani Devi, which donation shall be used for the purchase of Gurukula land. The stone bearing your mother's name in both Hindi and English will be laid down at the proper place just after the registration of the land.

Thanking you,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
