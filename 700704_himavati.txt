San Francisco

My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and I am very sorry to learn that you are injured in a motor accident. I have come to San Francisco on account of Rathayatra festival and shall be returning by next Tuesday.

Do not be worried by lying down. Chant Hare Krsna mantra and Krsna will help you to be free from this confinement very soon. In my previous letter I informed you that you better stick to the __arcana bidhi__ of the temple, and I confirm the same again that in future you will always remain in the temple. So we should always consider that this material world is a dangerous place and therefore we shall chant Lord Nrsimha's Holy Name in order to be protected by Him in all dangers.
