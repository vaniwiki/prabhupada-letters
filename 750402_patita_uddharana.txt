My dear Patita Uddharana dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 17th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for your articles. They are very nicely written. They have given us a good amount of space. That means that we can present our philosophy in detail and they will read it. Regarding that man Mr. Shah, you can ask him what is the best season for going to Dvaraka. Then I shall arrange for going there. I have never been there yet.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
