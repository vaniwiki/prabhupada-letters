Vrindaban

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Vrindaban dated July 5, 1972, and I am pleased to note the progress with Mr. Keating. You can send me the letters and documents as soon as possible, and we can use them in our propaganda work. I have sent one letter to Ish Kumar Puri, copy to you under separate cover. As for size of plates from Japan, you may correspond with Karandhara in Los Angeles about these businesses with Dai Nippon, as he knows all these things.

I am very much encouraged to understand that you are making nice progress with the building work. I have sent the Check Book, Punjab National Bank, account no. 642, under registered post, so kindly acknowledge if you have received or not. Then you remain as President of Vrindaban center, we shall see later on. As for Ksirodakasayi, he has decided to remain here in London to live with his family and work here to raise funds for future new London headquarters. There is one boy, Bhagavatananda, in Pittsburgh temple, who wants to have some new engagement and he is expert carpenter who has built many houses in New Vrindaban, so you may correspond with him if he can come to help you there.

I do not know what you mean when you mention the government is discouraging Americans from Vrindaban area, and that Subala may be deported. Kindly elucidate. So far the Delhi deities, one man here in London, Dr. Shah, wants to pay for the freight to bring them to Edinburgh where we have got one nice center for installing them there. But I do no know how it will be done. Anyway, keep them safely and we shall see later on.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
