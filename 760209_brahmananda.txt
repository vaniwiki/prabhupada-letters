====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

Nairobi

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 18, 1976.

It is good that you are paying your debt to the BBT. Please continue to do that.

As far as entering crematorium is concerned, no, we cannot go. That is social system, but we are sannyasis. A sannyasi is in spiritual life, not in social life at all.

We cannot pay for Shakti Mati to see her children. Concerning her scheme, who will pay the rent and who will manage? We cannot. It must be solidly discussed. We can consider at the GBC meeting. Things cannot be whimsically proposed and adopted.

That was a foolish letter sent by Cyavana. He was crazy. These things should not be done without first asking.

Regarding the devotees in Mauritius, first of all they must take care there. So some may come to Mayapur---1 or 2---but they must take care there.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
