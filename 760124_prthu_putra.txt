My dear Prthu Putra Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 12th January, 1976 along with the news clippings. The newsclippings show that the public has appreciated very much our Movement. You can hold similar such programs in every big city and you will always get a nice reception. This is really preaching and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu will surely be pleased with you and bless you. That you cannot stay anywhere very long due to the rules of your visa is a blessing in disguise. It is very good for a sannyasi. Narada Muni was similarly cursed by Daksa that he could not stay anywhere very long and this only increases his preaching. So you also increase your preaching and be more merciful to a greater number of persons.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
