My dear Mr. Varma,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your Hindi letter dated 25/11/76.

Come to Kumbha Mela by the 14th January. Please find our camp and try to meet us there.

Everyone in this material world is suffering. It is called dukhalayam ashasvatam. Why should you give up your life? Instead come and live with us the life of eternal bliss and knowledge. Do not unnecessarily complain. Just come and meet us in Kumbha Mela and we shall decide further.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
