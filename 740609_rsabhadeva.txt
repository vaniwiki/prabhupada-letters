My dear Rsabhadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of May 4, 1974, just received here in Paris.

I have accepted as my disciples the devotees recommended by you and their spiritual names are as follows:

Gary---Gopta dasa

Joe---Jyotirganesvara dasa

Peter---Padmagarbha dasa

Steve---Stavapriya dasa

Paya---Papaharinidevi

Rebecca---Rangavalli devi

Jayatirtha prabhu may chant on their beads and you may hold a fire yajna. Initiation means to begin so now these devotees, under your supervision must take the vow with utmost seriousness to chant everyday at least 16 rounds on beads and to refrain from the four sinful activities.

I have also accepted Bhojadeva dasa and Hrsikesa dasa for second initiation trusting that you have carefully examined their devotional behavior for the past year and that they have not deviated from the regulative principles. It is not that automatically we have to award a devotee second initiation after he has been with us for a certain time, but the qualifications have to be there. Enclosed find their threads duly chanted on by me and gayatri mantra. Have them hear the mantra in the right ear with the tape I have made.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
