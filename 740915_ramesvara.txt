My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 6, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding the Macmillan contract, if there is no mention in the contract of price increase, how they can do it? Consult a lawyer. But if by paying $20,000 to $25,000 we can be free of this contract and can print ourselves that will be better. Since they have broken the contract by increasing the price, we can compromise with them, and pay them something and be free from the contract.

I am hearing so many things about management. My request is that until I am able to return to the USA you all please work peacefully. At our next annual meeting at Mayapur all complaints and counter complaints will be heard in the presence of all GBC and I will also be present. In the meantime work peacefully without disturbing the situation.

In Bengal there is a proverb that even if there are some dead metal utensils but when they are together they make so much noise, so what to speak of living utensils. So this is natural, but since we are all pledged to work for Krsna we should follow the principle of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu trnad api sunicena taror api sahisnuna. This is Vaisnavism. So my request is do not be agitated. Let us do our duty honestly. Krsna will give us the intelligence to do everything nicely.

So far my health is concerned, I am improving daily, although I am not quite fit to the standard, but I hope that a change will come about during this seasonal change of October so that I will be fit enough to return to USA by next April by the time our Gaurange Hall will be complete. With great jubilation we shall open this hall for the glory of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

Europeans and Americans are very agitative, but since we have all taken a pledge to the service of Krsna, we have to change this habit for the peaceful service of Krsna. Everything will be all right by the grace of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In the meantime do not be agitated and remain Krsna conscious.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
