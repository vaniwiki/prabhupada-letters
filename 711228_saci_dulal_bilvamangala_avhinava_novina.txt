Laguna Beach

My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Rsabhadeva I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Richard/ Saci Dulal Das

David/ Vilvamangal Das

Don La Douce/ Avhinava Das

Sally/ Novina Dasi

I am so glad to learn that all of you have been such a great help to Rsabhadeva there in our Laguna Beach center. I can understand that all of you are very sincere boys and girl and are very eligible candidates for going back to Home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet all of you in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
