My dear Radhavallabha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 13, 1976 and have noted the contents with care.

You may title this book, __Teachings of Lord Kapila,__ but it must be subtitled, "The Son of Devahuti". That will remain, do not try to change it. The Americans may like it or not like it, but we must make the distinction between __devahuti putra kapila,__ and the atheistic Kapila. Do not try to change anything without my permission.

I will give you a foreword for this book.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
