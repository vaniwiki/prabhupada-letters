My dear Hansadutta das,

Please accept my blessings. Now, considering the European situation in a meeting between Myself, yourself and Bhagavan das, I think Madhavananda should become president of London and Prabhavisnu should become president of Amsterdam and you can arrange this.

Regarding the grhasthas living in the temple, I have already discussed with you in detail, so do the needful. The principle is that we make propaganda for devotees to come. Don't ask any of them to go away. That is not our principle. So, make nice arrangement for all the devotees there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
