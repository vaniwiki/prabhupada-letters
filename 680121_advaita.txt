My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 17, 1968, and I quite approve your planning on becoming a householder, and at the same time serve the cause of our society. A Krishna Conscious member even though he is a householder may spend at least 50% of his income for the society. The Brahmacaris are dedicated their life and everything but the householder should spare at least 50% of income for the society. That is the standard distribution of money example set by our predecessors, Srila Rupa Goswami, and Srila Sanatana Goswami. We may try to follow the footprints of our predecessors. Srila Rupa Goswami used to distribute his money as follows: 50% for Krishna, 25% for relatives, and 25% for personal emergency expenditures. I think this is very nice.

Yes, it is correct as you have handled the draft. As you have played the part of crazy, there is no necessity of reporting. That is quite in conformity.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
