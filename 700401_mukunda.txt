My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21st March, 1970. The karatalas have not yet reached here.

Yes, I am going to the newly purchased church Temple and when I go there by Sunday next, I shall try to teach the local boys in the way of performing Sankirtana in a circle. I shall send to you the sound production with photographs if possible, and instructions also.

I am awaiting the arrival of the karatalas.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
