Dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of April 29, 1974 with copy of the $50,000 check. I have also received a telegram from you today reading "Money traced to Central Bank of India Madurai 1 Tamil Nadu South PO Box 8 Second cable sent to transfer funds to Bombay Gowali Branch". Now Giriraja reports that the check has finally been deposited in the Gowalia Tank Branch.

I have also seen your reports of BBT loans to temples for various projects in the upcoming months. Regarding using New Vrindaban land for building for the older Gurukula boys it is a very good idea. As for the younger children it may be better to keep them in Dallas. But there are only 100 of them; whether they actually need new buildings in Dallas? This is to be investigated and decided upon by the GBC.

As for my own activities as you have requested, my schedule is: leave for Hyderabad April 18; after one week in Hyderabad I will travel one week in southern India; by middle of May I will leave India for Paris, and will travel 4 or 5 days in each place to Geneva, Rome, Sweden, then 3 or 4 cities in Germany. Then I may go to Rathayatra in Australia and back to India by Janmastami. After that I will go to England and then the U.S.

What is the news on our buildings in New York?

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
