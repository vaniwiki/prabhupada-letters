Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Deoji, (and Upendra das)

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two telegrams from Fiji, and I can inform you of the following. I am scheduled to leave Vrindaban for Bombay on the 12th April and then departing for Melbourne en route to Fiji from Bombay on the 18th April. Allowing some days in Australia, we could be in Fiji on or about the 24th or so of April. The only delay could be that I am scheduled to meet the minister of Haryana concerning the donation of land to us at Kuruksetra. If the meeting is favorable it may be necessary for me to attend a conference in Kuruksetra in late April, April 29th. However, that is not settled yet and so far my plans to arrive in Fiji on or about the 24th April stand. I shall inform you immediately as soon as I know of the Kuruksetra land. In the meantime, you should honor the contract, and if necessary do whatever is required. If I am delayed beyond the date of beginning the construction contract then I shall give you further details what to do.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
