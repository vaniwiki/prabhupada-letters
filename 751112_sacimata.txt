My dear Sacimata dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 23, 1975. So I understand that you are doing the layouts for the German __Back to Godhead__ and also the Swedish __Back to Godhead.__ The Swedish __Back to Godhead__ was very nice. I am very much appreciative. What I suggest for you is to translate articles that have been written by myself or the devotees as they are published in the English __Back to Godhead__ because unless you are conversant with the philosophy, it will be difficult for you to write authoritatively.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
