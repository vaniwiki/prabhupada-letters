Prasadam Distributing International\\
4350 Von Karman---Penthouse\\
Newport Beach, California U.S.A.

Dear Alex, Bob, Drdhavrata, Gupta, Rsabhadeva and Stan,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your invitation to the opening of Prasadam Distributing International Inc., and I found it nicely presented. Krsna will give you intelligence how to engage in honest, brilliant, glorious work on His behalf. There is no need to engage in anything dishonest. Krsna has given enough money, now earn by honest means.

I have also heard that you are making plans for a very large order of my books from the BBT to be sold on a door to door basis on the style of the encyclopedia sales. If you can do this it will revolutionize our book distribution and afford greater spreading of Krsna Consciousness than any book distribution thus far. I want that every respectable person has a full set of Bhagavatam and Caitanya Caritamrta in his home. I have given some suggestions how this book distribution in the homes can be done to one of my secretaries, Satsvarupa das Goswami and you can consult further with him as well as with Ramesvara and Tamala Krsna Maharajas. Hoping this finds you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
