My dear Satsvarupa and Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated August 31st, 1969, as well as the telegram dated September 4th. By the telegram, I understand that by Krishna's Grace it appears to be settled up, and you can continue your proceeding, chanting always Hare Krishna. He will always give us protection. I am very anxious to know about Uddhava's condition of health. May Krishna protect you all.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Police must give us special protection on account of threatening.
