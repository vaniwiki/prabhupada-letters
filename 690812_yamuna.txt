My dear Yamuna Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 4th, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding your questions about details for Deity worship, I have already mentioned in a previous letter that I shall teach you these things when I arrive in London. In the meantime there is no necessity for you to increase Deity worshiping. For the time being these new Deities may be put away nicely until I personally install Them and instruct you very nicely how to tend for Them correctly. For the present you may join Sankirtana Party because I know that your presence will enliven everyone. Actually, temple worship is for the neophyte devotee, and the preacher is in a higher position than the neophyte. That is the definition given in __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ The advanced devotee should be very much enthusiastic in preaching the transcendental message of Lord Caitanya, and temple worship should be entrusted to the newcomers, or neophytes.

Regarding the collapsing of the wheels during Ratha Yatra Ceremony, that doesn't matter. If possible, you may organize another procession on Janmastami Day. Regarding the footprint on Krishna's chest which you say is Radharani's, that is not correct. That footprint is of Bhrgu Muni.

As of this moment, my plans for going to Germany are not yet fixed up, but as soon as things are settled, I shall duly inform you. Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
