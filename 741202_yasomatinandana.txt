My dear Yasomatinandana das:

Please accept my blessings. I have received one letter from Sucarudev das, a devotee there who has some complaint, that he is left in charge when Mahamsa Swami goes out on tour, and no one cooperates with him, just sleeping and eating. So please enquire and let me know actually what is the situation there, and how things are going on. Also let me know what is the program for Hindi publishing there. Here in Bombay they are going on daily Sankirtana in Fort and selling 100 BTG's (English) daily, and they get requests for Hindi literature.

I have also received a letter from a diseased man, but what can I do? Please read the letter enclosed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
