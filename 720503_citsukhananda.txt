My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. We have received your letter dated April 26 1972, and noted the contents. I do not think I shall require special visa for going there for one or two weeks, an ordinary tourist visa will suffice. I shall be reaching Los Angeles about the 20th of May, 1972, and from there we shall make further plans and get visas for going to Mexico later.

The prospect there is very nice. I have read your progress report. As many Spanish-speaking devotees can go there as possible and help you, and you can expand into South America from there. The Mexican public is very sympathetic, so produce voluminously Spanish language literature. You can correspond with Karandhara in this respect of producing many, many Spanish books and magazines.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
