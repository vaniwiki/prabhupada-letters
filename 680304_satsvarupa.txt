====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept blessings. And offer the same to Jadurani & Pradyumna. I hope you are all doing well in the service of Krishna. I am leaving Los Angeles for San Francisco on the 8th March 1968 and therefore from the 6th of March 1968 you can send all mails to San Francisco. You will be glad to know that Jayananda is purchasing a nice house for San Francisco & I hope I shall get the Permanent Visa also. At present I am feeling well may Krishna give me strength to serve you more & more.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
