====== Letter to: Umapati ======

France

My dear Umapati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14 February, 1970, and I am so much glad to note how nicely you are realizing the importance of Krsna Consciousness movement. This is Krsna's grace; so work sincerely and seriously, and thus Krsna from within will reveal everything confidential.

Actually the whole world problems can be solved by this movement, that is a fact, but people are so much involved in Maya's activities that it takes some time to come to the right conclusion. But, if our preaching method is carried on in order, certainly it will be very much effective. So you are intelligent and one of the oldest members in the Society, and gradually Krsna is giving you better intelligence also; and thus push on the missionary activities as fast as possible.

I came to your country completely in helpless condition and Krsna is so kind that He has picked up some serious students like you; and my only hope is that even if I die these missionary activities will go on. And to keep yourself on the standard spiritual strength, please do not neglect the sixteen rounds chanting and following the regulative principles. Try your best, and Krsna will help you in all respects.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
