My dear Surendra Kumarji,

Please accept my blessings and also the same to your good wife, son, daughter-in-law and grand-children. I beg to thank you for your letter dated the 26th April, 1977.

I am coming to a place near Gwalior by the 7th of May, 1977. The exact address is c/o Adarsh Seva Sangha, Pohri District, Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh. I shall be staying there for at least four days so you can come there with your family and I shall be very glad to meet you all. I am progressing in my health little by little. My only disease now is I don't have any appetite.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
