My dear Alanatha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 4, 1975, with the enclosed copies of the Yoga Library in Swedish language. The get-up is very nice and I think they will sell very, very well. Just see what books we are publishing all over our Society in all the languages. Where is the CIA message in our books that they are claiming? They are claiming that we are CIA's, but where is the CIA message in our books? Our books are simply on the basis of Krsna consciousness. What better service are we doing than publishing these books?

But one thing is disturbing me, are these reports coming from Sweden. These books are translated by Vegavan and Ajita, so they are rendering good service to you. Do not deal with them by force. They are competent hands, so why fight with them? Do everything amicably. This fighting is going on everywhere. It is not a good sign. I know the fight spirit is there in you, within the Westerners, that even if you do not care to fight, someone will induce you to fight. Rather, you should make vigorous propaganda for making people understand the utility of the Krsna consciousness philosophy. It is not something speculative. Make your plans, organize, and then execute in order to increase all of our Krsna consciousness programs. This will be better.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
