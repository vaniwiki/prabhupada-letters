My dear Jagadisa Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 18, 1973. I was glad to receive the book distribution results from Toronto and especially the Vancouver Travelling Party. That they sold 100 Bhagavatams in two days is very nice. I think the Bhagavatam is now selling as well as the Gita.. So this is very encouraging to me.

Regarding initiations, I am pleased to accept the following boys and girls as my initiated disciples: Girijadhava Das (Gabor); Taraknath Das (Ted); Dustadura Das (Don); Kasiram Das (Joseph); and Jagatikanda Dasi (Janet); Atigarvita Dasi (Anne). I am also enclosing 12 Gayatri Mantras and 7 sacred threads duly chanted upon by me for the brahminical initiations.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. The beads may be sent to Satsvarupa Das Swami at Gurukula for being chanted upon, together with a copy of this letter.
