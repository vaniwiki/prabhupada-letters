My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26th inst. and have noted the contents. Hansadutta is not GBC, you are GBC. No, don't return U.S. Immediately come here and talk with me. Don't do like rascal.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
