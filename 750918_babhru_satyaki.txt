====== Letter to: Babhru, Satyaki ======

Honolulu

My dear Babhru and Satyaki,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 1, 1975 with enclosed check for $15.00. I thank you very much for it and for your appreciation of the Krsna consciousness movement. Please continue reading my books seriously and everything will be revealed to you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
