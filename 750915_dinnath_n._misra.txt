My dear Dinnath Misra

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 11, 1975. I have sent you one telegram as follows: RECEIVED YOUR LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 11 PLEASE COME HERE IMMEDIATELY\\
---A.C. BHAKTIVEDANTA SWAMI.

So I am here in Vrindaban at least up to September 25th or longer, as I am leaving for South Africa in the first week of October.

Kindly come here so we can discuss.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
