My dear Gargamuni Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 19/8/74 and 1/9/74 and have noted the contents. So you can fix up the Hindi High School Program as you have proposed, and we shall go. You can fix it for three weeks from now at the end of September. Regarding Kanpur program I could go for one or two days but in my present state of health it is hard to travel.

Regarding books supply, Giriraja informs that a shipment is due in mid September and they have already received the shipping documents. All titles have been ordered, and I have instructed Brahmananda Swami, Bhagavan, and Giriraja to take immediate steps. You must have sufficient stock of books. You can send your order to Giriraja, and as you are sending Rs. 10,000/- monthly, you should be supplied with the same amount of books.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
