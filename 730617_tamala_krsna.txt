Bombay

My dear Tamala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings I have received your telegram regarding Syamasundara asking devotees to leave India to be guests in the new London temple. So let Syamasundara come to Mayapur and we can discuss this and correct any difficulty.

Regarding our involvement with the property in Bombay: by chance we have been entangled but now a strong committee should be formed of our life members. Let them take it up, otherwise what can be done? Our men should be engaged for preaching---why should the preaching be stopped? I was very much encouraged when you and Gargamuni Swami purchased jeeps and formed a travelling sankirtana party. So why have you stopped it? Let the matter of the property in Bombay be dependent on the life members. They have paid us for membership and we have paid them, so they are also concerned.

Giriraja and a small staff can stay but they must be given visa facility. The next thing is if you take up this travelling sankirtana party seriously. Just as in USA they are sending buses from U.S. centers to the villages so you can do that and entrust this Bombay matter to our life members.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
