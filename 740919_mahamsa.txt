====== Letter to: Mahamsa ======

Hyderabad

My dear Mahamsa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter to Bhagavan das and upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept the following as twice initiated brahmanas: Sriman Vasugosh das and Madhavendra Puri das. Enclosed are their mantra sheets and sanctified threads. You can hold a fire sacrifice and they can hear the mantra from my tape recording through the right hear. The mantra must be murmured at three times daily.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
