My dear Sripada Sraman Maharaja,

Please accept my humble dandabats. I thank you very much for your kind letter dated December 31, 1968, I am so much grieved to learn the news of our revered god-brother, Swami Bhakti Sadhak Niskincana Maharaja, and I am so glad to learn that he passed away in full sense chanting "Krishna, Krishna". This is a glorious death. As it is said in the __Srimad-Bhagavatam__; Ante Narayana Smriti---this is the successful termination of our material existence. We do not know what will happen to us, but there is a Bengali proverb that everything will be tested at the time of death. So it is glorious for Swami Niskincana Maharaja that he has so gloriously passed away.

I see that Sripada Bon Maharaja was present at that time but I do not see any mention of Sripada Tirtha Maharaja's name. Anyway, we have already held a condolence meeting on this occasion in our Los Angeles temple in the presence of about 100 devotees, and we passed a resolution of our aggrievement which will be duly published in our next issue of __Back To Godhead.__ As desired by you your name has been registered on our mailing list and __Back To Godhead__ will be duly mailed to you. In our resolution we have mentioned about Swami Niskincana Maharaja's contribution both in English, Sanskrit, Hindi and Bengali, and everyone has appreciated this.

You will be glad to know that our London center is working for the last 5 months, and by the Grace of Srila Prabhupada, some English man there has agreed to donate a house for our temple there which is worth not less than Rs 800,000. The preaching work in other parts of our activities are going on, especially in Los Angeles, New York, Montreal, Boston, London and Hamburg. We have an invitation from Guyana, So. America, as well as from Hawaii where we have already got our own temple. __Back To Godhead__ is being published both in English and French language and very soon He will appear in the German language. Our disciples in Hamburg are proposing to purchase a printing machine, and they have sent me the news for my approval. So by the Grace of Srila Prabhupada Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, His mission in this part of the world is progressing slowly but surely.

Your previous letter was duly received by me and was replied to by me, and I hope you have by this time received the same. In both of your letters you have mentioned about grand preparations being made for the celebration of Golden Jubilee for Sri Caitanya Math from 7 February through 6 March. Prior to your information, our god-brother, Y. Jagannathan also informed me about this impending ceremony but so far as I concerned, I have received no official information from Sripada Tirtha Maharaja. I do not know why. If it is thought however that my preaching work in this part of the world is not connected with Sri Caitanya Math, I do not think this is correct because I was authorized to do this work by Srila Prabhupada, and I am trying to do my humble bit.
