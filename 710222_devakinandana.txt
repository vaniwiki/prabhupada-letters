(Attached to letter to Kirtananananda Maharaja, Febuary 22nd, 1971)

My dear Devakinandana, 

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your letter of March 1, 1972, and I am especially happy to see the pictures of such nice cows, so I shall pay the full $2,200 for the five cows you have suggested. Now you must exchange by giving me always pure ghee produced by them, and I shall be repaid in the shape of ghee. Actually, I want that New Vrindaban should be completely self-sufficient for this ghee production, not that the Society should have to subsidize New Vrindaban for nothing. No, you make only pure ghee, as much as possible, and ship to all our centers and they shall pay you for it a standard price, and that shall provide sufficient income for our New Vrindaban. Meanwhile, you may go on increasing the number of cows there by making a special programme of canvassing important persons to donate for buying more cows. In this way, make a programme to support New Vrindaban.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
