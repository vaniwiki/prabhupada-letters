My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil, and I am very happy to hear of your new plan for forming the travelling Hindu Sankirtana party. That is a very nice idea. So you may organize the party as you see fit, and if you yourself are able sometimes to go with them, you will be able to instruct them how to do it in the best way possible. You have got good experience for managing in business world, so why not you become also expert organizer for Krishna? That plan is very much liked by me, now do it nicely, and may Lord Krishna give you His all blessings more and more. Thank you very much for assisting me in this way.

If you are coming to Bombay side in February, I do not yet know what is my programme for that month, perhaps I may go to Australia, I do not know, let us see what Krishna desires.

Hoping this meets you and your good wife in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
