My dear Hitsaranji,

Please accept my blessings. Kindly refer to your letter dated January 13, 1968, which I have duly replied, but I have heard nothing from you. In that letter you write to say that “a sample of paper and a specimen of a few composed pages of your book will be sent to you by Sri Vyasji in a day or two for your perusal”. So I expected you above mentioned papers by the 25th January, 1968, but today is February 5, and I have received nothing from you.

I am very much anxious to know whether the printing works have been taken up. As I previously informed you in my letter dated January 4, 1968, I have to print so many volumes of books. The matter is almost ready. I wish to get at least 4 volumes published in every year so that I may be able to finish the job within my possible lifetime. Kindly let me know what is the position. I am very anxious to know it.

Regarding publishing of ISKCON Magazine from India: I have already informed you everything in detail in my last letter, and I am awaiting your confirmation. We shall be able to sell minimum 10,000 copies in our different branches, and as we are negotiating with many friends in Germany, England, Holland, we can expect another 10,000 copies for the European countries, similarly, we can organize in India. The writers and editors are ready to go to India, on hearing from you. Please let me know if there is any definite program in this connection. There is great prospect for this magazine if we can conduct it in our stipulated way. Kindly enlighten me about further development in this connection, as well printing work on my books.

I have heard from Achyutananda that you had arranged to pay from your trust fund Rs. 100/- per month to each of my disciples. It is very kind of you and I shall be glad to know further in this connection.

I hope you are well, and thanking you in anticipation for your immediate early reply.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
