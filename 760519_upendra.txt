My dear Upendra das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 13, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning the domes, the domes must be over the three Deities. The domes should not be brought to the front of the building. Their place is over the Deities, whether they are visible to the passersby or not.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
