My dear Prabhanu dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 15th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I have accepted Lauri and Joni for 1st initiation. Their names are as follows: Lalita devi dasi and Jivanausadhi devi dasi respectively. Their beads may be chanted on by Satsvarupa Maharaja. Also I have accept Simha dasa, Anagha dasa, and Dhanasri dasi, and Kantimati dasi for 2nd initiation. Let them hear the tape of myself chanting the gayatri mantra. It should be heard through the right ear. Their mantra sheets and threads are enclosed. Train all of our boys and girls to follow the rules carefully, chanting 16 rounds and reading our books very carefully.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
