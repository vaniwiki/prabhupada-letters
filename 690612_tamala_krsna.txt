====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am so pleased to receive your letter of June 9, 1969, and I can understand that Krishna is giving you intelligence how to manage the Western Coast branches of our society. I think you should now make an __ad hoc__ committee of management, comprising yourself, Jayananda, Cidananda, Dindayal, Upendra, etc. If in this way you can take charge of management affairs, it will be a very nice thing. So far as a seal is concerned, you can make your own seal exactly like the one we have got in New York. Simply you make the seal replacing the word New York for Los Angeles. That will be nice. I have got full faith in you, so by Krishna's blessing try to improve all the four or five branches there. Trivikrama das Brahmacari from Buffalo wanted to open a branch in Sacramento or Santa Monica, but I have advised him to go to London because recently I received a letter from Syamasundara that they have secured a nice house. It is not yet all settled up, but he wants the help of some brahmacaris. So I shall be glad to know if you can spare some brahmacaris for London. They are of course planning something very gorgeous, but till now it has not been tangible. But because they are working very seriously and sincerely it will be successful. At present my plan is that by the 10th of July either I go to London or to Los Angeles. That is certain. So even if I do not go to Los Angeles, the Festival will be nicely performed there. If I go to London I shall see that the Rathayatra Festival is also performed there, and I have written to Syamasundara expressing my great desire like this. But everything depends on Krishna's disposal.

Regarding your questions, it is all right to make up the plates for the feast as you have suggested so the guests will not have so long a wait after the offering. The the first plate made up, Krishna's plate, should be kept in a high place, a separate place, and covered. Then it is all right. Regarding Visala's idea of selling his car, that is all right, and the money may be utilized for Rathayatra Festival. But when I go I must have my car, so you will have to purchase. Regarding Jivananda and Harsarani, whatever you think is best for them is all right. And I approve of the suggestion you have made for them. Similarly, Mahapurusa may go to Vancouver. That is nice. As you see fit, you can manage such things without consulting me first. Now the West Coast management is practically on you. I am sure that Krishna will help you in this regards.

I am enclosing a letter for Devahuti, so you may please hand it over to her. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
