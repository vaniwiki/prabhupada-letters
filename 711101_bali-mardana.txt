My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26th October, 1971 with enclosures. I am sorry that your dealing with the draft board has been mishandled and therefore you are in difficulty. Anyway if need be you can go back and face trial as advised by your father's lawyer. I am enclosing herewith a certificate as founder-acarya of ISKCON movement. That is already recognized all over the world. So when you stand for trial you can show them all our books, newspaper cuttings, my certificate and you can plea freely that you are no longer interested in material activities, but you are completely engaged in Krsna's service. Many of our students have been accepted as ordained ministers of religion and in NY the draft board has recognized our institution as a religious establishment. I hope if the things are presented rightly by your lawyer, everything will be all right by Krsna's grace. There was a similar case with Vamanadeva and he was given the right to remain as ordained minister.

So far the leaflets sent by you which you want to publish during the Delhi festival, that is approved by me and you can do the needful.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am reaching Delhi on 10th Nov. at 8:30
