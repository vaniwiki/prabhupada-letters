My dear Hanuman,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from San Salvador dated June 28, 1972, and I am very pleased to note your progress by marching through the central America. It appears this part of the world is very, very sympathetic with our movement, so you may supply Karandhara with all the news reports and request him to send men to open centers. This travelling and preaching is very much appreciated by me and factually it is really Lord Caitanya's sankirtana movement. So you and your assistants have got my all blessings and encouragement, now go on with complete confidence and always praying for the protection and mercy of Lord Krishna, and there will be no impediments, rest assured.

If you require books in Spanish language, you may request Karandhara and Citsukhananda and they shall ship to you wherever you like, but this distribution of books, combined with preaching, is the best process for spreading Krishna Consciousness, so always there must be books.

Hoping this meets you in very good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
