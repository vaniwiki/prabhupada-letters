My dear Chidananada,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated June 24, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. Madhudvisa has already gone there as desired by you, and I am sure he will be very helpful. He is now a veteran trained man, and the Los Angeles temple is now an ideal place for all centers to take example. Now I hope you will be able to make San Francisco as important as Los Angeles temple in cooperation with Madhudvisa and the other devotees there. Please convey my blessings to Jayananda, who is helping so much now in organizing for the Rathayatra Festival. Regarding Kartikeya, if he wants to go to Germany, he can go, but if you require him in San Francisco at present, don't encourage him to go at present. But in Germany there is a need for brahmacaris, and Kartikeya knows a little German language. In Germany they are now printing a very fine German edition of __Back To Godhead,__ and I am enclosing some clippings and a leaflet they have printed there. If Kartikeya can explain the words on these pages, then he can be encouraged to go to Germany. Just today I have received invitation from Krishna das that they want me to go immediately there, and even they have purchased one ticket for me. I will not be able to go to Germany immediately, but perhaps after the Rathayatra Festival this may be arranged.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: Enclosed is one letter to be given to Umapati, along with German papers for Kartikeya and one note for Madhudvisa.

If you meet Reka the Bengali Lady, tell her that I have received her letter without her present address. If she wants to come here she is welcome otherwise I am going there until Ratha Yatra festival.
