My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 1, 1976 and have noted the contents carefully.

A film showing illegal techniques of distributing my books (Money shuffle) was never authorized by me. If it is actually a fact what you say, then stop it immediately. In all our dealings we should be above suspicion. They say first impressions are lasting. If someone feels cheated by our men because they are using dubious methods of distribution and collecting money our purity may be doubted and reputation spoiled. So please do not allow such film showing to take place until I have seen the film personally.

Thank you for the enclosed check. I am glad to note that your book distribution is going on nicely.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Jabier Rodriguez has been accepted by me as a duly initiated disciple, his name is Jaya Caitanya. Enclosed please find one Brahmin thread for the second initiate, and a mantra sheet, other may make copy.
