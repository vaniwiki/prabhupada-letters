====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Hansadutta das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 3, 1975 with enclosed clippings and the booklet on Cow Protection. Cow protection is one of the items of the Krishna consciousness movement: krsi goraksya vanijyam. raksya means protection. It is especially mentioned. Mukunda has done a great service. I am asking them to reprint it here. It will be very useful for preaching to the Indians. If you are sending men they can bring copies with them.

This time that there were 10,000 Indians for Janmastami is very encouraging. Yes, they are good supporters. Yes, I approve of your program. We work where there is a good field. Do it nicely. You have noted that is the secret of success. Please continue this policy of straight forward dealings. Regarding Bury Place yes, for raising money to purchase there will be no difficulty. Try to keep our temple there. Purchase it and then repair it nicely and it will be a permanent establishment. We are staying there for the last two years. How we can be moved from there? You can hold the day after Diwali the Anakut Govardhana ceremony. There should be heaps of prasadam.

Regarding the farm, our business is not farming. Our business is to spread Krishna consciousness. So in favor of Krishna consciousness whatever policy is suitable that we should take. Even if you move the farm, how will it be conducted if your devotees are not interested? No, it is not a good idea. It will mean our attention will be diverted. If you have got more men, then it can be tackled.

The clipping on the Janmastami day mentions specifically that the Manor was purchased by George for us. Keep this article for future if there is some trouble. Actually he purchased for this purpose. Encourage Alanatha in his publishing, and also in German language publish as many books as possible. Enclosed are letters about Hyderabad.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
