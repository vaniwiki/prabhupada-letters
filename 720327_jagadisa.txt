My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated February 15, 1972 and March 11, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear how you are expanding the book distribution program so rapidly. The more this literature is read and distributed, the more the world will be filled with auspicity. Please continue this program with ever-increasing enthusiasm and this will please my Guru Maharaja very much.

If we simply repeat this philosophy exactly as it is, without any misrepresentation or adulteration, then this movement will never be checked, and we will conquer the world. So please train up all these boys and girls in the philosophy and brahminical culture and they will become useful tools in the hands of Lord Krishna for saving all the fallen souls in this age.

So far putting the deities to sleep, there are some mantras, but whether in Sanskrit or English, the purport is the same. So, just like you are dealing with your beloved master, you can meditate---"Dear Sir, it is time for you to come and take you rest now. Please come." Then you should chant Gayatri mantra. They may be awakened in the afternoon with the same method that is used in the morning.

Please offer my blessings to all the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
