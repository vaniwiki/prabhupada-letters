My dear Daughter Jyotirmayi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter dated 28 January, 1970 along with your beads. I am very happy to accept you as my disciple as you are eager to love Krishna. I am returning your beads herewith duly chanted on by me and your initiated name is Jyotirmayi. Jyotirmayi is the effulgent energy of Krishna.

As my initiated disciple you must strictly observe the four restrictions; namely no taking of intoxicants; no eating of meat, fish, or eggs; no illicit sex life; and no gambling. Follow the prescribed regulations for devotional service and chant daily sixteen rounds without fail. avoiding the ten offenses against the Holy Name. Please take instruction in Krishna Consciousness from Janai, Malati, and Yamuna and the other advanced devotees there.

I am glad to learn that you are eager to become a sincere devotee of Lord Krishna. The process is very simple---chant Hare Krishna mantra always. become fully engaged in Krishna activities and be happy.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
