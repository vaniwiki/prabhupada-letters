Dear Sriman Patel;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3.6.76 which was addressed to Los Angeles now redirected to here. Therefore I am late in replying to your letter.

By reading your letter, it seems that you are very fortunate. Krsna has given you the best opportunity for developing your Krsna consciousness and certainly He wants to help you. Therefore He has advised you to approach me. As it is the desire of Krsna it is my duty to help you in every respect.

At present I am in Europe, France, and very soon I shall return to Bombay; the latest by the 15th August, 1976. My Bombay address is as follows:

Hare Krishna Land

Gandhi Gram Rd.

Juhu, Bombay 54

INDIA

I shall be very much pleased to see you in person in Bombay and certainly Krsna will give us the opportunity to engage you fully in Krsna conscious service. You are naturally a devotee of Krsna. Pray to Him always for help and chant the maha-mantra; Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Certainly very soon you will get all possible facilities for advancing in Krsna consciousness.

I am sorry I could not reply to you in Hindi because I have no Hindi Secretary here. I hope this will find you in good health. More when we get together.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
