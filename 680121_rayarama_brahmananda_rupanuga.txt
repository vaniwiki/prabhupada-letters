My dear Rayarama, Brahmananda, and Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I must thank you all, especially since I have received a note from Advaita Brahmacari reading as follows, "Everything is going very well in New York. I am so fortunate to have such sincere God-brothers like Rayarama, Brahmananda, and Rupanuga to help guide me in Your absence." Please continue this spirit of Krishna Consciousness and you will be blessed by Krishna more and more. I am so very happy to have such report from an impartial member. Hope you are feeling well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
