My dear Deoji Punja:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 12, 1975 and have noted the contents. What you have proposed I have no objections. Do it. Krishna will bless you for this work, rest assured. He will give you all facilities; that is His promise, and actually it is so. You are all respectable gentlemen, and I have full confidence in you.

Yes, I will come there to lay the foundation stone as you invite me.

I hope this meets you in good health. I am sending a copy of this letter to Madhudvisa Swami so he may be instructed to cooperate with you.

It is all right for the appointment of officers as you have suggested.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
