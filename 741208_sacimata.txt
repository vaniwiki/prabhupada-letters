My dear Saci Mata devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your Bengali letter undated and have noted the contents. It is good that you are keeping under your parent's protection for the time being, but wherever you remain do not forget to follow the four regulative principles and chanting at least 16 rounds daily

Then all other things will be manifested in you by the grace of Lord Krishna. It is the advice of Narottama das Thakura to chant the holy name of Gauranga either if one remains at home or in the forest. Similarly, do not forget the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra either you live in the temple or at home.

I am again going on tour of the Western countries this Sunday next.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
