Dear Mr. Saxena,

Please accept my greetings. I thank you for your letter of 16 April, 1974 addressed to our Bombay temple. For the present I am staying in Hyderabad and from here I will go to Tirupati to Balaji and by the 1st of May I will return to Bombay. I am very much pleased to know that you are trying to organize a home for retired gentlemen for fully devoting the rest of their lives for service to Lord Krsna.

My Krsna Consciousness movement is especially meant for this purpose. I wish that from the very beginning of life everyone should be enlightened with Krsna Consciousness, because the human life is very important for fulfilling this mission. The mission of human life is to understand the real constitutional position of the spirit soul and to know that everyone of us living entities is an eternal servant of Krsna.

So if your organization takes this mission seriously I shall help you to my best capacity. I am preaching this Krsna cult all over the world and have published many books based on the Bhagavad-gita and Upanisads and Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic literatures. If your society becomes a life members of our society you can get all these books already published and for life membership you can inquire from my office at Hare Krsna Land, Gandhi Gram Road, Juhu, Bombay 54.

Our principle is to become gradually purified by avoiding the four principles of sinful life, namely 1. no illicit sex, 2. avoidance of all kinds of intoxication, 3. avoidance of all kinds of eating of meat fish or eggs, 4. no gambling. And if one chants Hare Krsna Maha Mantra with a vow of at least 25,000 names daily minimum that will assure him all spiritual advancement. If you have time you can chant 100,000 times daily. I wish that you society's members may take up this vow; it is not very difficult. On that sound background if you read Bhagavad gita As It Is then you'll make rapid progess in spiritual life. In this connection I may quote a verse from Bhakti Rasamrta Sindhu by Rupa Goswami

> adau sraddha tatha sadhu-sango' tha bhajana kriya
> tato nartha nivrttih syat tato nistha rucis tatah
> athasaktis tato bhavas tatah premabhyudancati
> sadhakanam ayam premnah prahur-bhave bhavet kramah

THIS is the process. Thank you for your letter, and I am always at your service.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
