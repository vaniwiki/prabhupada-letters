Atlanta

My dear Balavanta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 23, 1976, with enclosed newspaper clippings, and I have noted the contents carefully.

In connection with the religious discrimination mentioned in the newspaper clipping from Atlanta; Wherever we live we worship God. We are not official worshippers. We worship wherever we are.

"Always chanting My glories, endeavouring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion."

Our religion is not a part time transcendental recreation. We live in God. Of course, "Hare Krishna" is there on all these newspaper reports, that I want, that somehow or other hundreds and thousands of men will chant Hare Krishna. They have made all plans to avoid God, and our plan is that they accept God. The struggle will become acute, because formerly they thought we were simply hippies, but now they see our books, that we are here to stay. The professors are writing books, like Hare Krishna and Counter Culture, beginning to realize that Hare Krishna is here to stay. So, now the people are becoming envious that in such a short time we are so well known. Do not be discouraged by these fools and rascals, and simply push on sincerely and Krishna will save you.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
