====== Letter to: Govardhan Das ======

My dear Govardhan Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 12, 1973 and have noted the contents. So far the new disciples are concerned, I am accepting on your recommendation the following as my initiated disciples:

Maharani Dasi - Shirley Daniels

Dhenumati Dasi - Coleen Handlon

Krsnakathananda Das Adhikari - Richard Marcolini and Sarvashaktimati das - Angeline Marcolini

Also enclosed find one sacred thread chanted upon for Phatikcandra dasa brahmacari. Let Satsvarupa Maharaj chant on the beads and hold a fire sacrifice amongst the devotees. Take care of the new disciples and please see that they are always engaged in Krsna's service, chanting Hare Krsna.

Regarding your successful book distribution, you should know that this is the greater preaching. I am very much pleased. the conch shells as you have described may be kept on the altar as decoration, but they must be kept clean. Everything on the altar must always be clean.

Who is that rascal sannyasi who has recommended to chant Pancha Tattwa mantra on the japa beads? First, send me his name.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
