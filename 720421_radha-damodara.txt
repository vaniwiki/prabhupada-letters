My dear son,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Paramesvari I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. Your spiritual name is Radha Damodara das Brahmacari.

I am so glad to learn that you have been such a great help to Paramesvari there in our Edmonton center. I can understand that you are a very sincere boy and are very eligible for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street sankirtana, etc. In this way keep yourself engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and the end reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
