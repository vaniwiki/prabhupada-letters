My dear Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 26, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. I have heard from Tamala and Mukunda that there is good chance of preaching our movement in Germany, provided our Sankirtana Party is well organized. For this purpose I have asked Tamala Krishna to stay in Europe for some time, and whenever you will require his assistance in Germany he will go there and stay for some time. After I install the Deities here on December 14th, he will be free to go there. The Deity worship should be done very nicely and cleanly, as advised by Yamuna and Tamala Krishna. I thank you very much for your nice presentation of the photographs of my Guru Maharaja and Bhaktivinode Thakura fit in a nice powder case. So I see my Guru Maharaja everyday, whenever necessary. It is kept on my table. I thank you very much for this. Please dress the Deities in your temple as nicely as possible. Also decorate Them with some jewelry. I have received one letter form Mandali Bhadra, and he has told me that he is feeling some disturbances. Under the circumstances it is better that he may live in the temple.

Please offer my blessings to Jaya Govinda, Vasudeva, Sucandra, Sivananda, Mandali Bhadra and Vrndavanesvari. I hope this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
