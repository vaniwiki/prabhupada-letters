ALL GLORIES TO SRI GURU AND GAURANGA!

My dear Sri Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed find the names of the devotees you have recommended for initiation which I hereby accept as my duly initiated disciples:

Bryan Davis---Basu-Ghosh das

Paul Wax---Pandrika das

Andy Frenkel---Sankirtana das

Puspu Singh---Yasoda devi dasi

Pat Langlois---Subhadra dasi

Edie Manischewitz---Urmila dasi

Also, find one sacred thread and two mantra sheets for the second initiates. Hold a fire yajna and afterwards the second initiates may listen to the Gayatri mantra tape through the right ear.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

ACBS/Kda
