My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6/12/76.

Jagadisa informs me that Sri Garbha came to him saying that he preferred to go to Mayapur, but that due to pressure from you he had agreed to go to Poland. So, for the time being let him go to Mayapur. We require many men there also. When he has to leave India he can then go to Poland. Are you going to Vrindaban?

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
