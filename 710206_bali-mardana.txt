My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th January, 1971. I am so glad to hear how you have secured a huge house until March 31st at no charge. It is all encouraging. If we can have this place on a permanent basis, that will be very good. And I shall be glad to go there whenever you will call me. Presently I am planning to return to U.S.A. by the end of March.

If we can get some Chinese followers of this cult, it will be a great success. I know that amongst the Chinese there are many scholars and learned cultured gentlemen. So to convince them will be easier than others, even though they are of the Buddhist philosophy. That is akin to our philosophy although it is a little different. Buddhist philosophy is direct renunciation of material life but they have no information of spiritual reality because the followers of Lord Buddha were more materialistic. Spiritual information was not suitable for them. Now we are presenting complete spiritual information. So preach to them in that light and surely you will be successful.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
