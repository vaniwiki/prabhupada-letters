My dear Sukadeva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 16, 1976 and have noted the contents.

On your recommendation I am accepting the following devotees for initiation:

__First Initiation__

William Jerald Leonard---Vidyagati dasa

Steven Edward Kulakowski---Svatantra dasa

Laura Ellan---Krsnalaulya dasi

__Second Initiation__

Piyuskanti das brahmacari

Sarva Satya das brahmacari

Please hold a fire sacrifice and present the names at that time. The newly initiated brahmanas may hear the mantra by tape in the right ear. The local GBC man may chant on the beads. All initiates must practice chanting 16 rounds daily and strictly follow the four regulative principles which must be stressed with great care so that they are very familiar with them. The brahmana must be clean inside and out by bathing with water and mantra. They must become fixed up in the sastra so that they may overcome the bondage of maya with the sword of knowledge.

As far as the problems mentioned in your letter, especially the comments attributed to you, I may clearly say that I never said that. But the GBC is there and others also, so these matters should be decided by them. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
