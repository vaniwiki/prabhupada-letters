My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated November 4, 1969 along with __BTG__ #29 and the new edition of __The Peace Formula__ essay. They are both very nice. The __BTG__ will be complete when the headings of the essays are bolder and on each page the name of __Back To Godhead__ is printed. The titlehead on the front cover is quite suitable, and the picture in the front page is exceedingly beautiful. I showed it to Gurudasa and he remarked that it is super-excellent and he expects it to sell very well because of this picture. I think similar pictures from Western centers should be printed. The New York Sankirtana Party is also super-excellent. I am very much pleased to see all these pictures and our magazines gives information to the people that we do not stick only to the cities, but we train people in the remote villages also. So everything should be done very attentively and amicably. I am writing a letter to Hayagriva that he should take care of composition of our books. Please find a copy of this letter enclosed. If you decide to go to Columbus, that is all right. Everything should be done very amicably. I see that in __The Peace Formula__ pamphlet that there is advertisement for __TLC__ and __Bhagavad-gita,__ but there is no mention of __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ I think that in the future this also may be advertised. What about MacMillan Co.?

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

PS: I have shown the new __BTG__ to Mukunda, and he has very much appreciated the nice lay-out work of Candanacarya.\\
enclosures: one carbon of letter to Hayagriva

Please let me know if all the books "True Conception of Religion" sent by Syamasundara Brahmacari are all sold and if we owe some money still due to him?
