====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 26, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. Regarding the distribution of Teachings of Lord Caitanya, the principle will be that 60% will go to the book fund, and the rest will go to you as the distributer. So you may offer to the temples whatever is suitable. But you will be the sole distributer and the book fund will get 60%.

Regarding the __Back To Godhead__ scheme, the idea is that you pay $750 and receive 5,000 copies. Now you distribute this as you like. If you sell for 50 cents per copy, then it comes to $2,500, but I do not think it will be possible to sell them all at 50 cents retail price. So you appoint stores to sell copies, and you will get 30 cents per copy for these without fail. You are purchasing for 15 cents so even selling wholesale you make profit of 15 cents. If you sell 3,500 copies at wholesale price, then the intake is $1,050. If you are not able to sell all of the copies, then still you should have an income profit of at least $500, selling at wholesale price. If you make more profit you should do so, and I have no objection. But whatever you sell after the 1,500 copies sold retail is profit for your temple. What ever balance has not been sold will be distributed free, and you should apply for concession rates at the Post Office. In Los Angeles, we have already applied, and the postal charge will be about 3 cents or 4 cents per issue. So as far as I am concerned, I shall collect about $3,000 monthly. Out of this, $2,000 is to be paid to Dai Nippon, and I will keep $1000. Out of this amount, the postal charges will take about $300-400, and the balance $600 I shall spend for developing of the press department. So from Back To Godhead I don't want anything for my book fund. I simply want my books to be nicely distributed.

As for someone to help you distribute books on the West Coast, I understand that Jayananda has volunteered for this assignment, and you can decide who you will like. So far as the list of distributers you have sent to Purusottama, they have been contacted, and they are waiting to see the first printed copies before any decision is discussed. But Purusottama will travel with me. That is certain. For the time being, I am going to Hawaii, and there is no sufficient place for him there. Therefore I am going alone. If there is a separate apartment available, then I shall call him there also. Otherwise, I shall come back within one month to Los Angeles, and then I shall go to New York, so you can make arrangements accordingly. This is my present program.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: You may send future mail to Hawaii center.\\
P.S. I shall be glad to hear from you if my idea of distribution is appropriate. I am going to Hawaii on Monday at 10:45 A.M. Kindly send the dry mango as usual to Hawaii temple address.
