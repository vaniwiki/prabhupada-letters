My dear Brahmananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 1, 1976.

If you are needed there, it is all right for you to miss the festival. You will have to accept the decisions made by the other GBC. You can gradually train Nanda Kumar. He is undoubtedly a good pujari.

Regarding your visa problem, I think by tactful arrangement they will extend, but you know better than me. Otherwise you can come here to India. Or better, why not go to Mauritius and take missionary visa there and at the same time work vigorously. Mauritius is also a nice place on the sea side.

Cyavana is now here in Vrindaban. And Caitya-guru is here in Mayapur working, so we shall see later on about him.

Regarding your questions about the problems in your zone and your question about why are you there, these should be taken up with the GBC.

Please keep some men in Mauritius to carry on as I have said in my last letter.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
