My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 18, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Your idea to go to San Francisco for a short time is nice. Yes, the San Francisco temple has deteriorated from its original position, so please try to reinstate it. Jivananda and Harsarani may also go there to help. You may also help to plan for the Rathayatra Festival, because this tradition must be continued. Regarding Girish, until I go to New Vrindaban, Girish may stay there. Otherwise he may be admitted in some school. We should not take any risk of legal implication in this matter.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: I am enclosing one letter for Jaya Gopala which you may hand over to him.
