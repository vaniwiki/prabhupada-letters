My dear Krishna devi and Dinesh Candra das,

Please accept my blessings. In continuation of my last letter, I have taken quotation from New York about record manufacturing and Brahmananda has sent me the following quotation as per leaflet enclosed herewith. Brahmananda says it will be still not cheaper so far printing of albums is concerned, so if we get 5000 albums, I have estimated, it will be more or less around 2000 dollars, or about 45 cents per record. So if Dinesh and you think that the record playing has come out very successful, then we must print 5000 copies. If you get $2000. from your father, that will be sufficient for 5000 copies, and if need be, we can arrange to invest one hundred or two hundred more, if so required. So you ask Dinesh to open correspondence immediately with Brahmananda, and it will be nice to print 5000 albums immediately.

The Sankirtana party is selling Back To Godhead nicely and if they display the record on a record player in the street, I think we can sell this album very nicely.* If you get a cheaper price than this rate, let me know, otherwise we may get it manufactured in New York. So far album art work is concerned, I shall ask Muralidhara to do it very nicely. So please let me know what you are going to do in this connection and I hope you are in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*I understand stereo records are in greater demand than mono records. So you will have to do stereo records.
