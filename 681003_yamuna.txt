My dear Yamuna devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter of 9/27/68, London yatra, and it is so much encouraging to me. Your appreciation is so nice, of Srimad Bhagavad-gita and Teachings of Lord Caitanya, and please continue to study and preach in this way to all you meet. I am very happy to learn that you are going to various homes and lecture halls, and holding kirtana and delivering lectures from these transcendental literatures. This is very nice. And if you continue in this way, gradually so many people will be attracted, and our London center will be very soon successful. I have received also your handbills, and they are also very nice. All this good news is very much encouraging to me, and I thank you all six sincere souls for carrying on this mission so enthusiastically.

The drawings for the certificate are enclosed herewith, and you can place them in proper position, as they look best. These recommendations may also help you: "Best use a 15x20 or similar proportion paper (hopefully you probably already have used similar size) Be sure that after pasting in each corner, that the edges are kept clean, so that they do not show when photographed. For printing they can be reduced some, to about an inch or two larger than a piece of typewriting paper (with whatever exact proportions are convenient to use in the reduction)." Muralidhara das has drawn these pictures, and they are very nicely done.

Today there was a television station interview in my apartment. They came with big cameras and microphones, and I played harmonium and one lady interviewed with a few questions. They took also pictures of my altar with Radha Krishna Deities, and Lord Jagannatha, and the cover pictures of my Bhagavad-gita and Teachings of Lord Caitanya. So it will be on the newscast at 5:00 this evening, in color, and we will go and see how they have done it. They also came to our class last night, and took pictures of our students dancing in ecstasy. So this should help our movement here in Seattle, as so many people will see, and come to our temple. You can try for television appearances there also if possible.

I hope you are all well, and I am always looking forward to hearing your good reports of the activities of the London yatra, and I shall be happy to come there when you are prepared for me. As ever I remain,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
