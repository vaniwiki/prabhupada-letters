My dear Govinda Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I hope that by now you have received the reply to your letter which you mailed just after your arrival in Hawaii.

I am very glad to learn that you have now become a very good housewife with your very good husband. It is learned also that you are cooking very nice foodstuffs for him. This is very good. Your husband is very busy now, otherwise I would have asked him to continue the work on __Caitanya Caritamrta.__ Now I shall be glad to know what you are doing. Do you propose to manufacture Kartamasi from there? But whatever you do, do it in a program. I hope this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Have you received any news from Jaya Govinda. His latest letter received yesterday is very disappointing. He has not mentioned about the murtis. Please remind him again. He appears to be on the path of Maya. ACB
