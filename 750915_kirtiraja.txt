My dear Kirtiraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated September 7 & 8th and have noted the contents and the enclosures. The reviews are very nice. He has written that people will want to learn Bengali just to read Caitanya Caritamrta. That was the prediction of my Guru Maharaja. This is very enlivening. Get all these appreciations published in a nice booklet.

Regarding your preaching in Poland, you go there immediately. Take this opportunity. I want that our preaching be pushed in the Eastern European countries. I have recently written to Bhagavan Das and Hansadutta regarding this. This boy who has written from Poland, can be sent a set of books, Krishna Book, Caitanya Caritamrta, and Bhagavad-gita. If he cannot pay that is all right. You are an intelligent boy, and I know that you will be successful in preaching there.

Regarding my birth date, it is September 1, 1896. Why is there question?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
