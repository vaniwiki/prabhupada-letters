Bombay

My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. There has been a slight change of plans and I will not be arriving Bombay on 31st May, 1971. Rather my arrival there will be delayed for a few days. At the request of my Godbrother, Puri Maharaja, I have consented to go to Rajahmundry with party for a few days. I will be leaving Calcutta for Rajahmundry program on the evening of the 1st June, 1971 and will let you know by telegram when I am due to arrive in Bombay. The address in Rajahmundry is as follows: c/o B.V. Puri Maharaja; Sri Krishna Caitanya Ashram; Rajahmundry-1; E. Godavari (A.P.).

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
