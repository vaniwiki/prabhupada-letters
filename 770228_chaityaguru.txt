My dear Chaityaguru Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I have just sent you a telegram reading as follows:

“COME MAYAPUR IMMEDIATELY SANNYAS CEREMONY”

So as I told you, I wish you to take Sannyas. The ceremony will be performed on Gour Purnima, the 5th March. You can arrange to come immediately.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
