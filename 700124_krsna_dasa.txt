My dear Krishna das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18 January, 1970, and thank you very much for your contribution of $15 on my maintenance account.

When you presented your scheme for preaching work in the whole of Germany giving an estimate of population of important cities, it gave me so much pleasure. Just on receiving your letter I am already thinking of how to organize it, and have written letters to Hansadutta and Uttama Sloka etc., but Upendra is destined to go to Australia. I am glad to learn that Trivikrama has joined you. So for the time being go on with your work as usual and consult with Tamala Krishna whom I am also writing in this connection. And try your best to spread the Sankirtana Movement through Germany.

Regarding Deity worship: I am very much anxious to know how thing are going on, who is taking care of the Deities, whether regular performances are being executed etc. I hesitated to install the Deities when I was in Germany on this account. Anyway, when the Deities are now installed there cannot be any scope of neglecting Them; that will be a great offense. Please, therefore, consult with Tamala how to manage things and if possible get some more assistance from London.

I have not heard from Vasudeva, Sucandra or Visvanatha and his wife Kunti Devi. Please let me know how they are getting along in Krishna Consciousness, and offer them my blessings and to all other devotees there.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
