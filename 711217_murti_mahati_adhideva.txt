My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Sri Galim I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows

__Bill Walsh__: MURTI DAS

__Sue Walsh__: MAHATI DASI

__Hayden Larsen__: ADHIDEVA DAS

I am so glad to learn that all of you are such a great help to Sri Galim there in our Austin center, and I have especially appreciated the murtis you are making of Pancatattva. I can understand that you are very sincere boys and girl and are very eligible candidates for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way, keep yourself engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
