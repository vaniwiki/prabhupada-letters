My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21st June, 1972, and I am very glad to hear that the proper permits have been obtained for the building work. but one thing, we are forming a cooperative society with our own members, but what is the advantage? I think that the cooperative society is formed in order to avoid paying some taxes, like stamp tax, but I just sent a check for Rs. 70,000/- to Giriraja for payment of stamp taxes, so what is the advantage if we still have to pay the stamp tax?

Yes, Giriraja is to be regarded as the absolute authority in all matters. Why do you disobey? Of course, everything should be departmentally managed, but unless there is discipline how will anything get done? If you are in disagreement at every point, how it will be possible to finish this important work? Anyway, please cooperate with Giriraja and the others, and if this is impossible then I will have to take other steps. If you want to go to Jaipur and Vrndavana for a little while, I have no objection, do it immediately.

Hoping this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
