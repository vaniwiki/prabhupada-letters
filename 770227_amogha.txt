My dear Amogha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 20th February, 1977. Thank you for the check of $20.

Regarding your situation, it is nothing new for Westerners. This is a family matter. It is better to consult Bali Mardan how to manage your personal affairs. He is a grhastha, so you can speak with him. You are an intelligent boy, so do not misuse your intelligence.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
