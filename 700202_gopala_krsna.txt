My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28 January, 1970 along with a bank deposit slip. Please convey my thanks to Labangalatika dasi for her contribution.

Henceforward you send the checks direct to me, because most probably I am going to close the account in Montreal. The reason is that they have deducted $10.08 as income tax because I am not residing there (non-resident). So I would like to keep that account for a little convenience, but if they charge such tax then what is the use of it?

I am very much thankful to you for your sending me the sweater, two pairs of shoes and a cap also. Thank you very much.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
