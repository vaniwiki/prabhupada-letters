My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. Recently there has been some disturbance in Nairobi and the things are not going on at all well. I have requested Brahmananda to take leave of the Nairobi matters and go out for preaching and traveling in Africa in general. So instead of going to China, you began in Africa, so why you cannot return there for taking charge? Brahmananda is not preaching, therefore the program is neglected, and I do not want to install the Deity at this time. But if you can return there and fix up the position, I shall be very much grateful. Kindly reply me at the earliest at the Los Angeles address.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
