My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21st August, 1971 and have noted the contents.

This is a very serious discrepancy that in four months Rs 23,000/- has been spent without any proper account. I have asked both Jayapataka and Tamala to explain about this and I am still awaiting their reply. Upon receipt of their letters I shall adjust things and let you know what is to be done. One thing is that I have asked Jayapataka Swami to make you treasurer so that you can look after things and see to it that such unnecessary expenditure is not made in the future.

All big donations, like B.M. Birla's, should be immediately deposited in the building fund. Not a farthing should be expended from such donations. That should be the policy.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
