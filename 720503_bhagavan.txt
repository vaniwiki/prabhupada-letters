====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

Detroit

My dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings. I am anxious to know what has happened to Aravinda since he left me in India. I think his parents live there in Detroit, his other name is Arthur Friedman, so kindly search them out and ask them where he is. I have given him his return ticket to Los Angeles, so I think he has returned to your country.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
