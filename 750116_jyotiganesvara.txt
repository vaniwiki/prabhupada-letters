My dear Jyotiganesvara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 4th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Because I am stressing one thing (book distribution) especially, does that mean that everything else is not important? No. Everything must go on. Please consult with your temple president or your GBC for direction as to what is your best engagement there in San Diego.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
