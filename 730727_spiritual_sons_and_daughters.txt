My dear Spiritual Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. On the recommendation of Govinda Das I have duly accepted you as my disciples.

Human life begins when there is systematic education in the science of God consciousness. Just some days ago I was discussing with Professor Alister Hardy---Head of Religious Experimental research unit Oxford, it was his opinion that the problems of human life are over-population, environmental pollution etc.. But from Bhagavad-gita we understand that God is the father of all living beings, so the father must be competent to provide for all the children, and in the case of the Supreme Father this is actually so---we get it from Vedic Literature "__nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam__ (__Kaṭha Upaniṣad__ 2.2.13)---Amongst all the Eternals there is one chief Eternal Being and he is engaged in supplying and fulfilling the desires of all the others." Therefore our conclusion was that the real problem is not over-population or pollution, malnutrition etc., but the actual problem is Godlessness. So you are all intelligent boys and girls---therefore my request to you is that you study this science of Krishna Consciousness and solve all the problems of the world by systematic propaganda as far as you are able to do it.

I have already given your names in the letter to Govinda das.

I hope you are well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
