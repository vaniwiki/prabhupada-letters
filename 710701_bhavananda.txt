My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. You will be glad to know that very soon I am planning to come to N.Y., as you have requested in your mailgram dated 29th June, 1971. So you can arrange for three world return tickets starting from L.A., to N.Y., to London, to Paris, to Bombay, to Calcutta, to Tokyo, to Honolulu, to L.A. once again. The three names are as follows: Syamasundara (Samuel Speerstra), Aravinda (Arthur J. Friedman), and myself.

Last time Karandhara arranged for five tickets: Tamala Krishna, Madhudvisa Maharaja, Kirtanananda Maharaja, Kartikeya Maharaja and Devananda Maharaja, as well as myself. So this time you can arrange for three tickets only. So keep the date open and when the day has been fixed up, I will let you know.

Also, I am wanting many men to go to India. At a recent meeting of the temple presidents from the West coast, I asked that each of our nearly 60 centers send at least one man to India. So if you can make arrangements like that, it will be very nice. Many men are required there; they don't have to be very important members. We are arranging for a big temple in Mayapur, the birthsite of Lord Caitanya. So we shall discuss further on this matter when I go there.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
