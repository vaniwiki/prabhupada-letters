My dear Lokanatha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10/12/76.

The preaching work you are doing is very good. Continue this program enthusiastically and increase your number of company. You have to create devotees by your preaching work and train them according to your needs. Krsna has given you and your companions a very nice responsibility. If you like you can go all over India and make it more and more in that way. Try to distribute Hindi and other vernacular literature.

Do not depend on outside help. Also, for financial support depend on Krsna. That is preaching success. People's appreciation will be practical when they help you financially also. Also, book distribution. We are maintaining our huge establishment by selling books. That is wanted. In foreign countries they are distributing huge quantities of books. Money is needed, that you have to collect. You can't expect money from outside. That is not successful preaching.

Regarding starting a center in Kanpur, that is a very good proposal. Yesterday one gentleman came from Kanpur to see me. His name and address are as follows: Mr. G. Pant/ 111A/87 Ashoknagar/ Kanpur 208012. He's a great devotee, he can help you. But, the center should be for this purpose, that you go to the villages for preaching and come back. But, if you become packed up in the center, that is not wanted. The center should be opened for financial help for the preaching program. Just like our Aksayananda Maharaja is sending out men to the surrounding villages and towns preaching and holding programs. This should be the purpose, otherwise you may simply go on as you are now and simply depend on Krsna.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
