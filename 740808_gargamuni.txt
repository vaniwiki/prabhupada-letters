====== Letter to: Gargamuni ======

Calcutta

My dear Gargamuni Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 2/8/74 and have noted the contents. You have not mentioned anything about receiving my letter dated 14/7/74 about purchasing the Pani Hati property. I want to know about this, so I am enclosing the copy of the letter.

Regarding Karandhara's comment that Mayapur and Calcutta were the best organized centers in India, that I know. I have full faith in you, and also Bhavananda and Jayapataka Maharajas.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
