My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated "nil."

Regarding your questions about the calendar-almanac:

1. __Herapancami__ is correct (9 July 1970).

2. When there is an important Dvadasi, the Ekadasi fasting is transferred on the Dvadasi, and this is called Mahadvadasi. The 26th October, 1970, is actually Dvadasi, so the fasting is observed together, or Ekadasi fasting is disregarded, and the Dvadasi (Mahadvadasi) fasting is taken as important.

You were give this __old__ Panjika just to consult the names and spelling only. The dates are different, so whatever date I have given, that is correct. Why you are searching Byanjali Dvadasi in this last year's Panjika? What I have given is from this year's Panjika, so everything will not collaborate.

3. The word is %%__%%. That is called __Odana-Sasthi__ and the date is 14th December, 1970. That is correct even if you do not find it in the dictionary. The dictionary may not have every word.

5. 7th February, 1971---Varaha-Dvadasi, I have explained the position in regard to #2.

6. So far determining Ekadasi it is counted 11 days after the full moon and 11 days after the new moon, but sometimes it so happens as you have noted one day later. However, what I have given is correct.

The Panjika which I gave you is old Panjika, our calendar is for this new year.

Regarding the Prayer book, I did not ask you to transliterate this---somebody else has underlined, I have not underlined it. I have received both the prayer book and the panjika also with your letter. Regarding your work on the Staal Correspondence, locating references to chapter and verses and adding appropriate translations after the Sanskrit, that is alright as you have done it

On page 13 of Three Essays, __manasinah__ is the correct word.

You must always ask the Lord's grace to make you in the right position. It is not for your sense gratification, it is for the Lord's service. For the Lord's service we can ask for His grace and mercy a hundred times, but for our sense gratification we cannot pray or ask anything---that is pure devotion.

I have also received a note from you, and regarding KRSNA chapter 31, page 4, top, the word __Hrdaya__ is correct.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
