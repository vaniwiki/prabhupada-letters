My dear Mahendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 8, 1973. You should not install the Deities until you have a complete program to see that regulated worship may go on nicely. Until then, simply worship Guru and Gauranga in pictures.

I hereby accept Brahma das and Sukhada dasi for second initiation. Enclosed find one thread and two gayatri mantra sheets. Take instruction from Rupanuga Maharaja on how to properly hold the fire sacrifice and have the initiates listen to the gayatri cassette tape through the right ear.

I also accept Peggy McArdle for first initiation and her spiritual name is Vidambha dasi. Rupanuga Maharaja may chant on her beads.

Thank you for your sincere service and offer my blessings to all the Prabhus there. Always maintain our simple standards and be enthusiastic and serious in pushing on this movement.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
