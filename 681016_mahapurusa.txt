My dear Mahapurusa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated 11th Oct., along with Gaurasundara's. So I am enclosing one letter for you received from Nandarani. The incident in Florida is to be forgotten. Now, with new energy, and in good cooperation with Gaurasundara, please try to establish a nice center in Hawaii. In the meantime, Murari might have gone there, so combined together, please try to establish a nice center there. Regarding your requirement, I am handing the note to Upendra, and I hope he will do the needful. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
