Dear Sriman A.D. Bhende;

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind note of 25-3-74.

Actually my program is to stay here a month, and I arrived on March 20, so I think you will be able to recover from your eye operation and come and see me. I am lecturing every night at the temple between 7 to 9 P.M. and I am staying at my apartment on Hare Krishna Land and you can visit me there any day after 5:00 P.M.

Thank you for thinking of me, and I hope you will soon be well enough to attend our discourses.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
