My dear Sri Govinda Das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. I can see that you are always thinking how to improve the society and push on this movement. All your ideas, they are very good. Go on like this and Krishna will give you more and more opportunity for His service. So your ideas are welcome. When the mind and intelligence work together like male and female, then something comes out as a child, or if the mind and intelligence are good then a good product will come out.

So all your ideas are very good and I have no objection to any of them. But these are all matters that should be discussed with Rupanuga and other GBC members. These matters are in their jurisdiction of GBC affairs and should be handled accordingly.

You write to say that with prasadam and the Maha Mantra we shall conquer over the world. That was the beginning of my program in your country. I thought like that. It was my plan from the very beginning before even coming here. So Krishna is giving us such good opportunity. We should utilize it.

Yes, just as soon as you have finished fixing up your new temple you can inform me and I shall be glad to go there.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
