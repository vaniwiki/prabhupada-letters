Dear Smt and Shri S.P. Malhotra;

Please accept my greetings. I was very gratified to receive your wonderful invitation. The invitation only reached me however after the event had passed. This was due to the fact I was touring in various places.

I am hoping that when I come again to Bombay I will be able to meet with your family.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
