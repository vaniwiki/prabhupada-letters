====== Letter to: Richard Mende ======

Mathura

Dear Richard Mende:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 7, 1974 and I have also seen the copy of the book you gave to Bali Mardan das. This edition can be easily had in Calcutta, so it is not necessary for us to keep it. I have therefore given the book over to Gurudasa, and he will see that it is returned to you.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
