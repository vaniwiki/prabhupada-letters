My dear Sucandra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated.

Krishna has been very kind to you that as soon as you have gone to Munich to open a new center, He has helped you with a very suitable accommodation. Now develop everything very nicely there and build a fine, strong Krishna Consciousness center. Be very enthusiastic and determined to teach everyone the message of Lord Caitanya. We must follow strictly the four regulative principles and always chant at least 16 rounds daily and this will keep us pure. Lord Caitanya wants that this movement be spread to every nook and corner of the earth, so we require so many hundreds of thousands of sincere young men like yourself to take it up. I wish that it will be noted down in history that this Krishna Consciousness Movement is responsible for saving the world. Practically, our Movement is the only hope for saving the world from complete disaster. So you have got all good opportunity now, do everything very nicely. Krishna will soon bless you with a nice child and as soon as it is born you may inform me and I will be pleased to give it a name.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Bhusakti and to the other devotees in Munich. I hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
