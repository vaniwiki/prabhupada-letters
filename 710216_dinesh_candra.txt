====== Letter to: Dinesh Candra ======

Boston

My dear Dinesh Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 23d January, 1971 and enclosed with one letter from your good wife Krsna Devi. It is so much encouraging that you are distributing our books so nicely in the Boston area and especially that several bookstore chains have taken so many copies of KRSNA book and TLC So see to it that this program continues there in Boston with increasing volume. That will be a great success for our missionary activities.

Yes, you can see to making more records, certainly. The more our movement is increased, the more the demand for these records will be there. People here in India are also wanting these records. So you can send one copy of every record as samples here immediately to the above given Bombay address. Records are exempt from our life membership program. Also the new recording described by you meets my approval, so do it nicely. You can send the booklet here as soon as it is ready.

So far as your establishing one center in Israel, I have already written Krsna Devi about this. I have all blessings for you both in this regards, so you may go there immediately.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
