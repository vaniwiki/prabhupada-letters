My dear Bhakta Lance,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter date Nov. 1, 1974 and have noted the contents with care.

My simple request is that you remain in association of devotees and continue to chant your 16 rounds daily and follow strictly the four regulative principles and read our books daily with great care. In this way your Krsna Conscious advancement will be assured success and at the end of this life you will go back to Godhead, back to home, and live with Krsna eternally.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
