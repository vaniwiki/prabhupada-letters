====== Letter to: Himavati ======

Hamburg

My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 17, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I have appreciated very much the photographs which you have enclosed of the Hamburg deities. They are very very nice. Yes, your husband is expert in everything and also you are expert in everything. So do not think in this way that you are not very important devotees, because I am always thinking of you both and how much service you are rendering to Lord Krishna. Since a long time I have known both of you and I consider that you are among my very dearest disciples. Now do not worry that your husband will take sannyasa. I think I have told you before that I will not give him sannyasa at this point. He may travel very widely throughout the Germany zone and still remain Grhastha. He is more than Sannyas.

I shall be coming to London for Rathayatra Festival this year. So I hope that I will see both you and your good husband as well as all the nice boys and girls in the European temples there in London at that time.

Hoping that this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami,
