My dear Revatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 3, 1972, from Edinburgh, and I am so much pleased that you are doing the real work of a sannyasi, travelling, preaching and training the devotees to preach. I am too much proud of you on account of seeing the newspaper items. Yes, if there is good response for purchasing our books and asking intelligent questions, that is the test of your preaching capacity. I can well remember that Woodstock Hall or Woodside Hall in Glasgow, so I can very well appreciate how nice these Scottish people listen to our discourse. Now develop this field very carefully, it is one of the best places in the world for our preaching work to take hold and convince the population gradually.

So far I am concerned, we have just completed our pandal programme in Hyderabad and it was very, very successful. In that portion there was no rain for two years, but due to our Sankirtana yagna the rain came and everyone was happy that we came to make it rain, and besides that they gave us some nice land in the most central marketplace of the city and we are raising up a gorgeous temple with the help of the local devotees. In the pandal programme sometimes I am thinking of you, how you are always playing the drum and singing. You are a very nice singer, that much I recall. Now give all the new brahmacaris your best instruction for making spiritual advancement, you are one of my senior disciples, so that much, if you do, that will be the best service.

One thing is, try to give Dhananjaya all encouragement for getting that new place near London with the help of George. I am always thinking of when I shall come to that place to live there, at least in summer months. I am always glad to hear your reports, you may send me from time to time.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
