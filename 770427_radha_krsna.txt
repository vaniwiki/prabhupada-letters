My dear Radha Krsna dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 16th, 1977.

As you have recommended them, I accept all six devotees for second initiation. This is the success of our movement---that our devotees are becoming brahmanas. To be a brahmana means to be clean, internally by always chanting Hare Krsna mantra, and externally by bathing regularly. You have to teach others to be brahmanas by your own personal example. Please find enclosed six sacred threads duly chanted by me. Now you must perform the fire sacrifice and after the sacrifice the new brahmanas may be allowed to hear the Gayatri mantra from the tape in the right ear. Now all of you combined together and very vigorously spread Krsna consciousness throughout South America.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enclosures: Six sacred threads for Akilapatit dasa, Agnipuja dasa, Lilanatha dasa, Mrgesa dasa, Rayaram dasa, and Harigada dasa, and six gayatri mantra sheets.\\
