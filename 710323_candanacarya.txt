My dear Candanacarya,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 30th November, 1970. Please forgive this late reply but due to my travelling, much of my mail has been delayed. I have received the enclosed copies of BTG, numbers 36-38 and they are very nice. The layout made by you and the others are completely satisfactory. Thank you very much. I have again begun speaking on the tapes and very soon you will get transcribed copies of my dictaphoning for being edited and laid out for printing, chapter-wise, the fourth canto. Let the second and third cantos be finished quickly so that the fourth canto can be started. Henceforward I shall be supplying material for all cantos and you must do the rest; editing, layout, printing, etc.

Such chapter-wise printing of Srimad-Bhagavatam is very suitable and convenient, so you may continue it. Also, you say that you are now distributing BTG no. 35, but I have never received an English copy, so you can send me one.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
