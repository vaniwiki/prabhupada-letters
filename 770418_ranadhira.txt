====== Letter to: Ranadhira ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ranadhira,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 8th, 1977 along with the enclosed review from "Choice." The review is very remarkable considering the importance of the journal, and I thank you very much for securing it. You have written: "We are all eager for the day when your books are recognized as the greatest masterpieces of all. We are all eager for the day when your books are the most demanded works in the library. We are sure that day is not far away." Yes, Krsna will fulfill your desire. Actually it is so. But because they are fools and rascals it will take some time. Regarding the error which the critic has noted about the location of Tirupati, I did not say so. It should be corrected.

Do not worry. I have not stopped my business. I am writing at night even though I am not quite fit. Thank you all for your prayers.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Thank you for sending me a copy of the anthology by Professor Robert S. Ellwood, Jr. They have quoted very nicely from our Krsna Book.\\
