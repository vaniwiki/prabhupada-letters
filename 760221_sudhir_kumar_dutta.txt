Sudhir Kumar Dutta\\
Calcutta

My dear Sudhir,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 18, 1976. You can come immediately and talk with me at Mayapur. You can inquire from our Calcutta temple, because often our men go here by jeep. So you can take that opportunity to go by jeep. You may also phone the Calcutta temple; the telephone number is 44-3757.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
