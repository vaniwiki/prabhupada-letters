My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings.

Upon your recommendation I will accept the devotees whose names appear below for first initiation and also the one you have recommended for second initiation. Please hold a fire sacrifice and instruct the new initiates to follow the four regulative principles and chanting sixteen rounds daily avoiding the ten offenses. You may chant on their beads. Play the tape of me chanting Gayatri mantra in the right ear of the second initiate and teach him how to count on his fingers.

Bhakta Andy---Ananta dasa

Bhakta Randy---Raghunatha Bhatta dasa

Bhaktin Gayle---Gopamatrka Dasi (from Baltimore)

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
