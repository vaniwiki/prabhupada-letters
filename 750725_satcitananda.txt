====== Letter to: Satcitananda ======

Vrindaban

My dear Satchitananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Vrindaban and am very engladdened to hear of your report how things are going on. You have given me great pleasure and I thank you for your attempt to please me.

Regarding your going to Malaysia, at the present moment we are not going to open a temple there. We first want to see that the Vrindaban temple is going on very solidly. So go on with working there in Vrindaban for the time being, and when I return to Vrindaban in October I shall speak to you personally.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
