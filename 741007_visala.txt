My dear Visala das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 15, 1974 with enclosed donation of Rs. 211/- and I thank you very much for it.

I think you can let me know how you are doing there in Delhi for collecting for our Vrindaban temple.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
