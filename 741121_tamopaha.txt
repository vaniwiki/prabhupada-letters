My dear Tamopaha Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated November 4th, 1974, and have noted the contents. I thank you very much for your sincere efforts to be Krishna Conscious and surely you will be blessed by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Rupa Goswami said a person somehow or other should become attached to Krishna, therefore if you are happily engaged in serving in Honolulu then you should continue your service there. If the foundation is strong in chanting and hearing then your Krishna Consciousness is assured. All these activities are pleasing to me that you are chanting, Worshiping the deity and writing, So please continue and increase your enthusiasm and then surely you will become successful in your Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
