My dear Ranadhira,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram dated July 28, 1972 and I am to inform you that we shall not advertise in this way because we have not yet received visas for Bangladesh. When we get Bangladesh visas and actually begin our preaching work there, then we shall be able to advertise and collect. So for the time being, do not advertise in this way. I shall be looking forward to seeing you by the end of August. Meanwhile, hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
