====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

London

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 19th May, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully.

So far as the Deities are concerned, they should be repaired nicely and replaced on the altar. While being repaired, where is the question of offering? The picture on the altar is all right for the present.

I am very glad to hear that Murari has returned and is working to pay off the money he had taken. And your scheme for making new members by plane chartering is proving to be successful, so continue it. You will be glad to know that very soon, within one week, Syamasundara will be going to London, but my program is not yet fixed up.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
