My dear Rupanuga Maharaja;

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 21st, 1974.

I am not interested to spend money for your political party neither engage our men to divert attention from spiritual progress for political propaganda. So studying your letter thoroughly I have come to the conclusion you may stop the political program. It will not benefit our real spiritual position.

My only idea was to point out to the public that unless you have purified leaders there is no possibility of advancement even in the material condition. I had no idea to spend money and energy of our society in a way which is not our real spiritual life. As for the Harmonist articles, they are not bad, but the same thing could be presented in our Back to Godhead.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
