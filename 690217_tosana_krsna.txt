====== Letter to: Tosana Krsna ======

My dear Tosana Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 10, 1969, and I have noted the contents with appreciation. If you have received any letter from Bhurijana in North Carolina, then you can immediately go there. It is on experimental basis for now. If you are successful, it is Krishna's Grace, and I hope that certainly you shall be successful. There are so many students there, and perhaps there is no other organization of this nature. So you shall go there simply to perform kirtana, read from __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ and try to sell at least one copy to each student of our __Back To Godhead.__ That will make our propaganda successful.

Regarding your headaches, your bowels are not clear. This is the cause of the problem. So you should take more milk and fruits, and eat less wheats and rice. If sandalwood oil is available, you try to massage on your shaved head. Let me know how this trouble is improving. A brahmacari should not have any complaint of bodily disease.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
