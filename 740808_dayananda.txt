My dear Dayananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 10, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding the candidates for first initiation, I have initiated them as follows:

Gary Dallman---Gambhira

Mike Mitchell---Mahavaraha

Butch Eichelburger---Bhusaya

Hector Veriell---Hemanga

Christina Kennedy---Krsna devi dasi\\
Please see to it that they follow strictly the rules and regulations as I have given you.

Regarding the second initiations, I am especially concerned that the second initiations not be taken cheaply. Brahmins are expected to rise early in the morning and follow strictly all the devotional practices. So I am enclosing the sanctified sacred threads and mantra sheets for Niragadev das, Paratpara das, Rajarshi das, Nirnasa das, and also a sheet for Vrajaraja devi dasi. So hold a fire yajna and impress upon them that they are taking vows before Radha and Krsna, the spiritual master, and Vaisnavas. Everyone must always chant 16 rounds and follow the four regulative principles.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
