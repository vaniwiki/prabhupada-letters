My dear Nityananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 3, 1971, and I am very happy to hear that you have got a new son to raise as a great devotee of Krishna. You may call him Bhakta Vimal Das. So long as a devotee is not initiated he should have Bhakta before his name, if he is a male, Bhaktin if she is a girl.

I am very pleased to hear that you are increasing in your distribution of our books and magazines. This is a good sign that your preaching work is also strong. The more you increase your strength in preaching, the more you will go on selling books. I want especially that my books be distributed widely. So it is also very encouraging to learn that you are preaching in the schools. If you do this nicely, then you will have no end to your success, because these students can understand our Krishna philosophy and become convinced by it, more easily than others. So if they join you, then our Movement will grow like anything.

As soon as the Jagannatha deities are finished, you may install them nicely. Satsvarupa will give you direction how to do it. He is in Dallas now.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
