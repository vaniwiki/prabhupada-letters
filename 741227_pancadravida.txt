Bangkok

My dear Panca Dravida Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am very interested to know how the program in Bangkok is going. I have just written Trivikrama Maharaja in Hong Kong that you and he can work cooperatively together and maybe arrange some big programs in Hong Kong, and you can go there, or arrange big programs in Bangkok and he can come there. Anyway you are both very near so this may be beneficial for both of you. Please make sure that you and your assistances are keeping yourselves fit in Krsna Consciousness by chanting 16 rounds daily and following all the principles very strictly, holding classes, rising early etc. Then the program there will be sure to be successful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
