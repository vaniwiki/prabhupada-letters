Tokyo

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 23d July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear that you have again come to your senses and are arranging for your good wife Cintamani to return to Tokyo. She is a very nice devotee; that is a fact. And it is your duty to take care of her and see to it that she becomes Krishna Conscious. So work cooperatively, husband and wife, and make our Tokyo center most successful. That is my request.

So far as translating our literatures into Japanese language, you should endeavor to do so vigorously. You have published only one Japanese BTG, but they should be regularly published. So if you go on and engage your mind in all this positive work, it will help you to rapidly advance in Krishna Consciousness. So far your going to the GBC meeting, if you cannot go there because of lack of funds, that is all right.

In regards to Kartikeya Swami, I have already written him one letter and replied the point. Most probably very soon I shall be sending another sannyasi there to help you.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Cintamani. Hoping this will meet you and Kartikeya Maharaja both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
