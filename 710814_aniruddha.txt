My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 9th August, 1971. I have already chanted your beads and they are enclosed herewith.

Please be engaged in the service of Lord Krishna very enthusiastically. You are my old disciple and I know how much enthusiastically you were working in the beginning at the old L.A. temple. Now you can revive the same old energy and develop San Diego center. Krishna is giving you a nice place to serve so utilize it properly.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
