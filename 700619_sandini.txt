My dear Daughter Sandini Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your nice letter dated 10th June, 1970, along with your beads and request for initiation.

So I am very happy to accept you as my initiated disciple, and your spiritual name is Sandini Dasi. Please keep this nice attitude of service which you have expressed in your letter, this is very necessary. Always chant the sixteen rounds of Hare Krsna Mantra on your beads, follow the four restrictive principles very rigidly, live peacefully according to the rules and regulations and your life will be perfect and sublime. Serve Krsna to the best of your capacity and when you are 24 hours engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord that is the highest stage of transcendental bliss or Krsna Consciousness.

Please study our literatures and work to spread the movement of Lord Caitanya namely the Sankirtana Movement and be happy. That is my desire.

I am enclosing herewith along with your beads duly chanted one sheet of qualifications and regulations for devotees.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
