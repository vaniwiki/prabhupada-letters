My dear Maeve Davies,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7 February, 1976.

Please do not be worried. Our movement is essentially for spreading this chanting of Hare Krishna world wide. And the main responsibility of my disciples is to follow the four regulative principles and chant 16 rounds without fail. Please worry about that first.

The best thing is to send your daughter to Gurukula, but if you cannot do that, then somehow see that she is trained nicely in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
