New Vrindaban

Dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your two questions which you conveyed to Satsvarupa on the telephone.

Regarding installing larger deities at the New Vrindaban farm temple, which is now exclusively for brahmacaris, yes, why not? Brahmin brahmacaris are very nice for deity worship. You have asked about Balarama Krsna deities. No, Balarama and Krsna are already there as Caitanya and Nitai: __Vrajendranandana yei, saci suta hailas sei__ . . . The best thing is to establish Gaura Nitai deities. In Vrindaban we are establishing Balarama Krsna deities because most of the temples there have Radha Krsna and there is not Balarama-Krsna. That has a different purpose. We should not imitate that. Better to have Gaura-Nitai, Radha-Krsna, and Lord Jagannatha---that system must continue.

Regarding what to do with the skim milk after the ghee has been produced. So far I have experience in India, after churning the butter the remnant is called __gohle__ this gohle is called sour milk. Sour milk can be taken by the members of New Vrindaban along with food. In India in villages they have enough milk and sour milk is taken in place of water or in dahl with salt and pepper. So sour milk should be taken by the devotees and ghee used. Cheese is very valuable. Sometimes it is used by sweet meat shops in India and it is called __khurcha.__ If you like you can make cheese but we require much quantity of ghee. My idea is that in India there is a great scarcity of ghee, but I don't think it is practical to send ghee from New Vrindaban to India. Anyway, go on developing New Vrindaban into an ideal community, and I shall be pleased to see the new additions when I come there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
