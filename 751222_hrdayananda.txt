My dear Hrdayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your letter dated November 29th 1975. The poem is very nice, however one should not think himself a devotee, poem 3. should read

"Your servant's calling so sadly,"

"Your servant's falling so badly,"

"A servant's trapped in the city."\\
one cannot call himself a devotee, but servant he can call himself always.*

Your bus program sounds nice, it is approved my me.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu presented Himself as "__Patitam kimkarana mam visamey charambudhva". Kimkaram__ means __servant.__\\
