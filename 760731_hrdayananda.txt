My dear Hrdayananda Maharaja;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the new KRSNA books and your letter dated July 24, 1976 and with great pleasure I thank you for them. Please offer all the devotees my blessings. Their enthusiasm for distributing my books will please me very much. Not only will I be pleased, but my guru maharaja will also be pleased and they will all be blessed. This is very good news, prithivite ache yato nagaradi grama sarvatra pracara hoibe mora nama, this is the way of preaching, to spread the news of Krsna in every town and village all over the world. Thank you very much.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
