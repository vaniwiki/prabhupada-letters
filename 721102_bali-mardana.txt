My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 20, 1972, and I have appreciated very much the enclosed booklet, "Krsna, the Reservoir of Pleasure." Although none of you have yet been here in Vrndavana, still, Krsna has given you the spiritual vision and you are seeing Vrndavana actually, the paintings are so nice. Just see how the cows are looking at Krsna. Now you distribute these books by millions all over the world, then everyone will see how wonderful is Vrndavana. That is the best preaching work.

According to the list of names left in the file by Nanda Kumara, there are nine names listed for New York, as follows: Mike/Mahamuni; Steve Anderson/Sevananda; Steve Chichi/Satajit; Jeremy Darling/Yogendra; Jack/Jitasvara; Saul/Sunanda; Andrea/Alarka; Susan/Sikhandini; Rosemary/Ramesvari. So I do not know why they have never received their beads. I think best thing is to write to Nanda Kumara, who is now president of Laguna Beach temple, and he can explain.

If you have got paintings for India, I think they may be sent by ship, well-packed to protect from water and with insurance, and that will not be too much expensive. Better to consult first with Indian embassy if there are any restrictions to import paintings into India.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
