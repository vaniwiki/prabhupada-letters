My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your three letters post dated March 5, 1969, and I thank you very much for them. I have noted your points, and one thing is that the instruction given by one gentleman Mr. Somanatha to go to India as agriculturalists is absurd. Don't be carried away by all this nonsense advice. So far Indian authority is concerned for preaching work, I am prepared to go to your center for preaching at any time you call me. Your statement that you will try to organize the Hamburg center very nicely and have a smooth running energetic temple when I go there is also very encouraging. Please stick to this principle without any diversion. Take it from me that I am always praying to Lord Krishna for your success in Krishna Consciousness movement. You're very sincere devotee and if you simply stick to the principles, success is sure for your life. Krishna's Mercy is always bestowed upon one who is sincerely serving Him. You should not give attention to any outsider's advice because they are completely unfit to give you advice. Your situation is different. We do not care for any agriculturist or economist. Our only shelter is Krishna. Stick to this principle and success is sure for you.

I shall be glad to hear what about the press matter and printing Back To Godhead in German Language.

Chanting 16 rounds without fail, performing Kirtana at least twice daily, morning and evening, discussion on Bhagavad-gita, and Srimad-Bhagavatam in the class, and work diligently and cooperatively amongst yourselves is my fervent request. Kindly follow this and be happy.

Please convey my blessings to Krishna das and Uttama Sloka. I have received letter from Jaya Govinda that he is anxious to come back to Germany. I have also advised Krishna das to arrange for his passage, but I have not heard anything from them. Please let me know at your earliest convenience. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
