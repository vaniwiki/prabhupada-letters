My dear Hrsikesa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for you very nice note enclosed with Hayagriva's letter. I am so glad to learn that you are reading my Bhagavad-gita As It Is with great interest, and I hope if you kindly read my books carefully that all your spiritual desires will be fulfilled. And you are in the right place for doing this, in New Vrindaban, and I shall be happy to meet with you again when I arrive there in May.

Thanking you once more for your nice letter, and hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
