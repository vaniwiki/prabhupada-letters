My dear Niranjan,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 14 June 1973 and have noted the contents.

I will be glad to see you here in Mayapur when you are able to come after finishing your exams.

Regarding the new names of your sister and mother-in-law%%----%%why are you giving them spiritual names? You are not authorized to do this. Spiritual names are given by the spiritual master at the time of initiation. It is not to be done as a whimsical act. Rather, it is done strictly according to regulative principles.

I have received your printed invitation and send my thankfulness to your father, please send him a letter of thankfulness on my behalf.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
