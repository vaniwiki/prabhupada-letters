====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from you in a long time. I hope you are well and things are going on nicely there at our Dallas center. How are the property transactions going on?

Enclosed you will find one letter from Samkarsan das brahmachary of Austin temple. So that is in your zone. He has so many questions, and these types of enquiries should be answered locally. So you can reply this letter and send me a copy also so that I can see how you are answering.

Things are going on very nicely here in Nairobi and the response by the Africans to this Sankirtan movement is very much encouraging. From here I will be going to Bombay, by the middle of the month.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.\\
Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
