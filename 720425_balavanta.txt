Atlanta

My dear Balavanta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your invitation dated April 8, 1972, inviting me to come there for Lord Caitanya's Festival, and I thank you very much for it. Unfortunately, I got the invitation quite late, in New Zealand, and by then our program had been fixed to go to Japan. So we shall be here until 6th May, then we are going to Honolulu until 20th May, then to Los Angeles. I have heard that the meeting in Atlanta was a very great success, and that many people attended, but I have not heard from you the details, and also how your political campaign as mayor of Atlanta is running.

According to our vedic civilization, this Krishna Consciousness Movement is supported by the state. We are already explaining these things in the chapters of Srimad-Bhagavatam regarding Prthu Maharaja. Unfortunately, people have taken religion as a fictitious faith, therefore the modern state they are not interested in fictitious faiths, and as such, they declare "secularism." Actually, it is the necessity of the human society to become Krishna Conscious and each state has to take it seriously to implement the idea among the citizens. So we expect to push on our movement to that extent, that is our objective.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
