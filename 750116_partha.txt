====== Letter to: Partha ======

London

My dear Partha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 7th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your idea sounds very nice. It is a good proposal. Is it practical? Can you do it? If you think it is practical and you can do it, then it could have very nice results. Work nicely with Hansadutta and see what can be arranged.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
