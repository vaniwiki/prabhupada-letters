Dear Sri Tripathi,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 15 August 1976 and have noted the contents with care. Thank you very much for your enquiry.

I shall be in Vrndavana by the 2nd or 3rd of September. Please come and see me at that time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
