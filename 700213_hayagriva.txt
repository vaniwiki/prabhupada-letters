My Dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings. Regarding the Krsna manuscript, it has to be delivered to the Dia Nippon Company because the arrangement was with George Harrison that I shall get the book printed within the winter.

So it does not matter that the whole manuscript is typed or untyped. It has to be delivered as it is. So you may send the manuscript immediately to Brahmananda or take it yourself to New York for delivering to Dia Nippon. This most important. I have asked that the manuscript be delivered by the 15th February, so please treat this as very urgent and do the needful.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
