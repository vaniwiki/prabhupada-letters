My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 26, 1975 and have noted the contents. It is a great credit that you have met with the Chief Minister and now he will give us all help. Why you did not apply immediately for the NOC? You should do it immediately, if you have not done so already.

Regarding Bangalore, I am not much interested in staying there. I have already got so many places to stay, but I cannot stay in any of them for more than a few days.

Why the guest house in Vrndavana is not yet organized? You have not even mentioned it in your report. That will pay for the maintenance budget if you simply organize it. You must do it immediately. Pranava and Dhananjaya together can organize it, or anyone else who may be able to do it, but it must be done. Why is there delay? Stop construction for the time being, and clear all of the debts.

Regarding Hong Kong, Bhurijana is in Melbourne and he is again ready to help there if he is needed. Yes, try to start a center in Malaysia. That Malaysian boy can help in this connection.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
