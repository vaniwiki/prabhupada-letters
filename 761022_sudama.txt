My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 7, 1976.

Yes, there was some rumor, but I did not believe it. I am confident now that you'll stick to our Krsna consciousness and do the needful. May Lord Krsna bless you.

I never said that your troupe should come to Bombay for the opening. That is not very necessary.

I appreciate very much your dedication to preaching in Japan.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
