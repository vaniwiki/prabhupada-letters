Dear Mr. Mayavi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 26th, and have noted the contents carefully. At present, I am very busy and have very little time; still your ideas are very nice. However, unless we meet together, it will be difficult to give you help. Perhaps you can come to see me, as I will be in Vrindavan, at our Krsna-Balarama Mandir, Raman Reti, in March, and afterwards, through April, I will be at our Bombay Mandir, Hare Krsna Land, at Juhu Beach. As far as your manuscript is concerned, it can be reviewed by my personal secretary, as I may not be able to spare the time.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
