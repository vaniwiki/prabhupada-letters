My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1st January, 1972.

The program for publishing as you have outlined is very nice with a few corrections. We do not need to publish in English either BTG or books, since these we will import from either Dai Nippon or ISKCON Press. But if you can arrange for Hindi and Bengali BTG and Hindi books as you suggest, that will be excellent. The idea is that by the profit out of BTG and Book Sales if you can maintain the establishment and meet the expenses, then I have no objection. From Book sales at least 50% of the face value of the book has to go to the book fund. And from the sales of the BTG at least one rupee per magazine should be paid to the book fund. So whatever remains after this can be utilized by you to do the publishing. But I cannot pay you Rs. 1000/- per month from here, that is not possible. So somehow arrange for the publishing of all our literatures. I have got full faith in you, I know you are sincere and a hard worker, so I have got confidence in you to do this. Ramananda is our Hindi editor, one man here, Mr. Chakravorty, I am training in Bengali translation and he may be the Bengali editor, you are in charge of publication, and Rohininandan and Sunil can assist in the Hindi and Bengali work respectively. So with full faith in Krishna and Spiritual Master, push on this work with full force. We have got a great mission to fulfill, and these books and magazines are the torchbearers of Truth which can save the world. If you can find a suitable place, then I have no objection to Rohininandan coming to assist you.

The Delhi municipality has promised to give us land, so why they are not giving? Secure the land in Delhi which the municipality has promised and you immediately save the Rs. 500/- from rent. And from the Building Fund we can immediately construct a building also. Somehow or other secure the land and in the beginning pitch camp and then later on we can build.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
