Dear Rajendra Sahai,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of February 2, and heard the contents. I am glad that you are thinking how the Beni Madhava Temple may be properly utilized by our Krishna Consciousness Movement, and I am hopeful of discussion with yourself and the Mahant on this subject. I am sorry you are indisposed and cannot come to our Gour Purnima festival in Mayapur. However, I am scheduling a visit to Vrindaban, approximately to arrive the 16th of Feburary or thereabouts. Then when I am there you can arrange, if possible, to meet with me.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
