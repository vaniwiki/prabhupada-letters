My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to all the Press staff. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 27th April, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Yes, I have sent off the Preface to the enlarged edition of Bhagavad-gita As It Is, sent from Sydney, and you should have received it by now. So far as the dummy is concerned, I have not received it as yet. When did you send it, and where? But there is no need of sending another. Whatever you have selected is all right. So far as the cost of printing, one girl in Baltimore has donated $15,000 and I have advised that it immediately be sent to the Press; the remaining $5,000 will be sent by Karandhara.

I have also received Pradyumna's letter, but I cannot understand what he is asking. It is not clear. It is wrongly written or something, so better to reject it. Neither I can guess what is the purport.

Yes, very soon I shall go there. In the meantime get busy with the printing of Bhagavad-gita and that will encourage me to come there sooner.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
