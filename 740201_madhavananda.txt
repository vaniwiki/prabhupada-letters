Bhaktivedanta Manor

Dear Madhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 14, 1974.

Please see that accounts are kept carefully, not that money is taken for whimsical expenditure. Be vigilant. Syamasundara has made a scandal by taking money of the society's and investing it in business. This kind of thing should be carefully watched. I am still awaiting repayment from Shayamasundar.

Please pursue the projects underway. Your attempt to construct a temple from donation of life members is welcome. Also your plan to get large tax returns. Now do it cooperatively. You are intelligent and experienced---all work together there for the glory of Lord Caitanya's sankirtana movement.

I am leaving tomorrow night for New Delhi and shall be there by the 3rd February.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
