My dear Krishnanga devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4th February 1976.

Do not let your mind be disturbed by so many things. Our movement is for chanting Hare Krishna. One can be happy under any condition. Samah duhkha-sukham dhiram. Krishna Consciousness does not depend on any external arrangement. You should not go outside of the shelter of this ISKCON. Just try to be happy by chanting Hare Krishna and following the regulative principles.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
