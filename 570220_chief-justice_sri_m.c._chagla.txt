The Hon'ble Mr. Chief-Justice Sri M.C. Chagla\\
Chief Justice House,\\
Harkisan Road,\\
Bombay-6.

My Lord,

I beg to inform your Lordship that on the 16th instant I was present in the meeting of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in which your Lordship spoke something at length on the matter of equal distribution of wealth as the ultimate solution of economic problem. The subject matter dealt within the meeting was "What is the matter with the world?", and you all respectable gentlemen tried to solve it in different angles of vision. Sri Munshiji tried very faintly to solve it by going back to Godhead and I do not know whether your Lordship agrees with him.

I may introduce hereby my humble self as the editor of a fortnightly Theistic periodical and copies of the same are sent to your Lordship for your kind perusal. I came to Bombay from Vrndavana to see Sri Munshi on the same mission of going back to Godhead, because without this there is no solution of any problem, the world is now facing.

The Bhagavad-gita is the standard book in this matter. Sri Munshi is trying to utilize this philosophy for the good of the people in general. He is spending establishment charges to the extent of Rs. 40,000/- per month for the last twenty years---but actually no tangible benefit is derived out of it up till now. I saw Sri Munshi with a view to cooperate with him for implementing the transcendental ideas of the Bhagavad-gita. But I did not receive any encouragement from him so far. I am, therefore, seeking an interview with your Lordship to discuss for a few minutes about this standard idea of solving the problems.

In the Bhagavad-gita the solution of the problems are given in the following words,

> Bhoktaram yajna tapasam
> Sarva loka maheshvaram
> Suhrdam sarva bhutanam
> Jnatva mam santim rcchati
> [[books:bg:5:29|(Bg. 5.29)]]

> Yat karosi yat asnasi
> Yaj juhosi dadasi yat
> Yat tapasyasi kaunteya
> Tat kurusva mad arpanam
> [[books:bg:9:27|(Bg. 9.27)]]

Equal distribution of wealth or knowledge, beauty, fame, energy and non-attachment etc., all these are perfectly done by the above arrangement. The matter is more explicitly understood by the example of our own bodily structure. The whole body is constituted of the senses and organs. All the senses and organs are equally supplied with energy when the stomach is fully fed up. Stomach is the central figure for distributing equal energy to the respective parts of the body as much as watering the root of the tree is the source of supplying energy to all the branches and leaves of the tree.

The human society is now running on in an illusory way, forgetting its eternal relation with the Central Cause. They will have to be reinstated in that original position in terms of the above slokas of the Bhagavad-gita. Without this no solution is possible. There are practical ways and means to do this job in accordance with the present time, situation and objective.

I have a programme for this job by the order of my spiritual master and I have come to Bombay to enlist some sympathisers with my object. Will your Lordship be kind enough to hear me for a few minutes and oblige?

Yours obediently,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta
