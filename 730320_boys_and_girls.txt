Los Angeles

My dear boys and girls, you are working so hard for broadcasting the glories of Lord Krishna's lotus feet and thus my Guru Maharaja will be so pleased upon you. Certainly my Guru Maharaja will bestow His blessings thousand times more than me and that is my satisfaction. All Glories to the assembled devotees.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Every one should go with the Samkirtana Party as soon as possible.
