====== Letter to: Jayatirtha ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Jayatirtha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 14, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning the idea of having a restaurant with the temple, if the temple and restaurant are mixed then it is not a good idea. However, if the restaurant is completely separate entrance and the activities of the restaurant do not mix with the temple at all, then it is possible, otherwise not.

I am writing and enclosing the two letters of invitation that you have requested, one to Mr. Modi, and one to Mr. George Harrison.

In Germany they are not able to sell the big books, that is not very good. I am informing Tamala Krsna Goswami in New York to try to arrange to send some men to Germany to help train the men and distribute these books.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
