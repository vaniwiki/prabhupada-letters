My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated August 7th, 1972, and noted the contents thereof. I shall be returning to Los Angeles in a few days from London, and I shall probably go to New Vrndavana for Janmastami as planned. I do not know if I will be able to come to Toronto after that, as I have been traveling all over the world over the past few months and it is a bit straining. Now I am thinking to sit down for a while in Los Angeles for translating work, but if I get opportunity I shall certainly come there as you have invited me.

I am very glad to hear that the program in Canada is being managed by you very nicely and that everything is expanding in Krsna consciousness spirit.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
