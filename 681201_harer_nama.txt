My dear Harer Nama,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated November 22, 1968 and I thank you for it. It is very nice that you are preparing these puppet stories of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Such program will not fail to have an uplifting effect upon the viewers as well as the players. So do this nicely, it shall be very good. I also understand from your letter that you and Tosana working outside to support the Santa Fe temple. This is all right and you should continue with this. Our program is that no matter what our engagement may be, we shall perform it in Krishna Consciousness, chanting Hare Krishna and thinking about something of Krishna, His Name, His Form, His Beauty, etc. This will bring the highest benediction of our life and by executing the same we shall elevate not only ourself but similarly we will elevate those with which we come into association.

So far as explaining my letter to Kris, I have listed the ingredients which may use for preparing prasadam but these various varieties of foodstuffs may be prepared either in the given recipes or if you like you may invent nice new formulas for offering. The important thing is that your preparations be palatable for Lord Krishna and that the ingredients be within the groups of ingredients already listed. You have asked me about sassafras and yes, it may be offered. Mushrooms are generally not offered, but there is no prohibition, there is no harm in them.

I hope that this has answered your questions. Please keep me informed as to the progress of your temple. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
