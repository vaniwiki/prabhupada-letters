My dear Madhudvisa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 13.73. and have noted the contents carefully.

I was just thinking of you, why you had not sent your report. I thought you had become angry because I did not go to your place but came instead to London. But at that time I was so sick - attacked by dysentery. The people in Calcutta became afraid for my life. So somehow or other I recovered by 7th July and appeared fit, so I dared to come to London.

Now my health has improved and attended a grand Rathayatra festival here - find clippings enclosed. The overall effect of our festival here was appreciated by everyone, more than 10,000 persons took part and received Prasadam. Syamasundara said that afterwards all people in London have become very friendly with us on account of being impressed with our festival.

So when shall I be able to go? I am to go to Los Angeles by the end of August. Thereafter I may be invited to Japan and whenever you call me after that I shall come.

30 lakhs cash are required to solve the problem of India.

Yes! You can practice the restrictions for Caturmasya. Pradyumna Prabhu will send you these under separate cover.

I hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
