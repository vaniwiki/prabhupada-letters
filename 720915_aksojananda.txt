My dear Aksojananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 11 September, 1972 and upon your recommendation I am very glad to accept Anga das Brahmacari for the second initiation. Enclosed herewith please find one copy of Gayatri mantra and also one sacred thread, duly chanted by me. Now hold a fire yajna, and teach him how to count on the finger divisions, then play the Gayatri mantra tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra through the right ear. Have him repeat along with my vibration, word for word, and then hang the sacred thread on his neck as usual. This Gayatri mantra function should be held amongst the devotees only.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
