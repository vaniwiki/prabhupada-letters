My dear Indra pramada das,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received a copy of Back to Godhead number 62 and I wish to express to you how pleased I am with the layout and design of the magazine. I have been especially admiring the pictures in the story of our Los Angeles center, and the way the pictures are placed and the use of the color throughout the magazine is very pleasing to me. I think this American company Donnelly, is better than Dai Nippon and the magazine is improving more and more. Try to keep up this present standard and think of new ways to make it always fresh and attractive. Krsna is all attractive and evergreen, and you must use your talent to layout the magazine so that Krsna appears in print as He is. Thank you very much and offer my good wishes to Jayadvaita and everyone who has worked on this issue.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
