My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I hope you have safely reached your place.

I have received letters from London that they are organizing World Sankirtana Party very seriously; therefore, it would be better if you go first to London and see how things are going on, then you may go to Germany if it is needed. They have asked me to send Visnujan, but I think if Visnujan goes from L.A. there is no second man to organize the street Sankirtana here. Practically, in his absence, his place cannot be immediately replaced. But if you go to London and join the Sankirtana Party, I think the vacancy there will be filled up. So I shall be glad to hear from you what you decide to do.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
