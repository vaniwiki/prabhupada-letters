My dear Vaikunthanatha,

Please accept my blessings. I have only just now received your letter undated, in which you refer to a decision to be made by the government on October 11 whether or not we shall get a large building on that land.

I had expected some news of this plan you have proposed, but til now I have not received from you any word. I am very pleased that you are progressing nicely in spreading Krishna Consciousness there in Trinidad. I shall be especially glad to hear that you are distributing our books in good numbers, as this is the proof of the strength of our preaching. Until we can build that place, go on preaching very strongly in that Hindu temple, take engagements in various places, teach in schools, like that. In this way, keep yourselves engaged in Krishna's preaching work 24 hours and you will become really happy.

Now the war is nearly settled here, our programs are resuming, and I think that I shall also build a very nice temple in Vrindaban and Mayapur, so that our students and friends all over the world may come there and enjoy real spiritual life.

As for my coming there, that we can settle up when I return to your country by late Spring. Now I want to stop touring and begin full-time my translating work. But if there is good opportunity, then I shall certainly come there.

I hope this will find you and your good wife, Saradia dasi, in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
