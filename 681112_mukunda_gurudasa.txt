My dear Mukunda, and My Dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your respectful letters dated Nov. 7, 1968, and I have noted the contents with great interest. I shall reply them separately. Dayananda has told me that Mr. George Harrison is interested to see me, and he is going to stay one week more, and so let us see what happens.

Hope you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
