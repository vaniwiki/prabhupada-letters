My dear Gunagrahi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 2, 1973. I hereby accept on your recommendation, Hasyakari Prabhu and his wife Nari devi dasi as my second initiated disciples. Enclosed find one thread duly chanted on by me and two gayatri sheets. You may take instruction from Rupanuga Maharaja on the proper performance of a yajna and the mantra may be heard through the right ear from the cassette tape recording.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
