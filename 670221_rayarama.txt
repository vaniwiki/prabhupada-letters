My dear Rayarama,

I am in due receipt of your long letter. I do not know why Back to Godhead is not printed timely. If it is printed send here the necessary copies. I do not know who said that Back to Godhead is to be printed here. Unless there is written order by me Back to Godhead should regularly be printed from New York. There is no question of its being printed here. So go on printing it right time. You can send the copies here with bill and I shall see that it is duly paid.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
