My dear Tripurari Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am glad to learn of your success at the Chicago airport for distributing 800 big books and collecting $4000. I think you should distribute more parties to go in different parts of the U.S.A. Regarding adding the name Krsna to the airport name, anyway you tried. This is Caitanya Mahaprabhu's blessings that everyone of us should become a sadhu and preach Krsna consciousness. So far Krsna consciousness is concerned, we have got new and sufficient number of books and if we read them carefully and reproduce the purports in our own language, that is perfect preaching.

I am very much obliged to you and your government that both the people and the government of America do not put any hindrances in distributing our books. This kindness of your nation will cause the blessings of Lord Caitanya to be showered upon them and the higher section of American people will all of them become Krsna conscious. So many books they are reading, so will there not be any effect?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
