Kuala Lumpur

My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from you in such a long time and am anxious to know what is your program there in Kuala Lumpur; how long will you be staying, how construction is going on, what plans are being made there, etc. So please let me know all the details as soon as possible.

Presently I am in L.A. and everything is very nice here. You will be glad to know that I have again begun my translating work and have sent five tapes to Satsvarupa thus far. Very soon though I will be going to N.Y., probably by the end of this week. From there I will go to Europe and then on to Mayapur for the founding stone ceremony. So most probably we will meet again at that time.

So please let me know how you are doing there right away. I am anxious to know. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
