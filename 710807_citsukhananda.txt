Mexico City

My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very encouraging letter dated 28th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear that you have gone to Mexico City with Jan and Bhutavhrt Prabhus and have rented a nice house in the central part of the city. From your description I can tell that there is great field for spreading this Sankirtana movement there and if you are sincere and determined in your efforts then surely Krishna will give you all facility. So go on and do things nicely and work very hard to make our newly formed Mexico City branch a grand success.

Keep in contact with me occasionally by mail and as soon as you have established yourself nicely there, then as soon as I find opportunity I shall visit Mexico City.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
