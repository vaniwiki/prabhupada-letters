My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find tape no. 14; S.B. 4th canto, 11th chapter continued. This is the third tape sent from London. Also please find one poetry enclosed for publication.

I have just now received your presentation of slippers as an offering for Vyasa puja day. They are certainly very attractive. Thank you very much for them and offer my thanks and blessings to all the nice boys and girls there in Boston.

There is a story about one man, a cook, who bought a nice new pair of shoes. But all morning long he was in the kitchen cooking and so he couldn't wear his shoes. Similarly, all afternoon he was cooking. So what did he do? At night, when he went to sleep he wore the shoes. So these shoes are so nice, but I don't know when I shall be able to wear them. So when taking rest at night I shall wear them.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
