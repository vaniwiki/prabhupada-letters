My dear Jaya Gopala,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated November 13, 1969 with enclosure of my maintenance check. I hope everything is going on nicely in Columbus, and I am sure under your able management it must be going on smoothly. I have written one letter to Pradyumna and Arundhati regarding composing my books, so I am very anxiously awaiting the reply. Please inform them about this and let me know what is the situation there. Offer my blessings to all of them, and I hope this will meet you in good health. Thank you very much once more for your letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
