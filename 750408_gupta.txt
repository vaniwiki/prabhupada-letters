My dear Gupta Dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 8th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your idea for writing articles for different legal journals, that will be very nice. I think it will be best if you take a little help from the editors who will be in Los Angeles soon. They can help you to make sure that nothing is stated improperly. They are experienced, so consult with them. Jayadvaita and the others are now here in India, but they will be back by the first of May, so take their advice in this matter. Please continue your work, and most of all try to rigidly follow all of the rules and regulations and chant at least 16 good rounds daily without fail.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
