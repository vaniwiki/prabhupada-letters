My dear Bali Mardan dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 6th along with photographs and have noted the contents. Yes take this house at any cost. It is very nice from the photographs, just suitable for our purposes. You should purchase it at once. If required, you can have a loan from BBT for the renovation.

Yes, Krsna will give you strength, as you engage yourself in His service, Tesam satat-yuktanam, bhajatam priti-purvakam, dadami buddhi-yogam tam, yena man upayanti te. "To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me". [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]]

Hoping this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have sent you a telegram reading as follows\\
