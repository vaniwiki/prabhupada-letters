My dear Hrdayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 4, 1972, which I have only just now received, due to travelling these past weeks. Yes, your plan for travelling and preaching was very much approved by me, but now I understand from Satsvarupa that he has gone to Dallas to manage things there because Stoka Krishna has left to Los Angeles. Are you travelling now alone, or what shall be your programme now? This constantly changing managers is not good. We shall develop more progressively by sticking in one place and working, not that one week we have three presidents, that is not good. Our managers should be very responsible for developing their centre to the topmost standard, why this restlessness? It is just like one man is holding government post by getting votes, so today or tomorrow or next day, but he will have to go out, then another man comes, then another, another---in this way, democratic system, no one becomes responsible for the welfare of the citizens, only they want to take for themselves as much as they can before they have to get out, so they do not take real interest in their duty. It is a little like that. My idea is that the leaders must agree to stick at one place, even they may have to remain their life-long, that is the ideal leader, one who is conscious of his duty.

But you are sannyasi, and sannyasis duty is different: travel widely and preach. That is sannyasa. So I am very happy to hear you are doing that, now go on vigorously preaching and distributing books, especially among the college students, and utilize every moment to spread Krishna Consciousness knowledge to everyone. That will be the perfection of your life.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
