My dear Bhagavata Maharajaji,

Please accept my humble obeisances. Enclosed please find the original of one card received by me from our God-brother in Chandigarh, wherein he has requested to take another order shipment of our books for selling from the Math at Chandigarh. Similarly, in Bombay, Visakhapatnam, Rajamundhry, and other places all over India, the Sri Caitanya Gaudiya Math institution, which was founded by our beloved Prabhupada, His Divine Grace Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, in so many places they are displaying and selling many, many of our books and magazines. So I am enclosing here-with also one list of our publications. It is not complete however. Since the enclosed list was printed, we have put out also our many other books. So my request to you is that you will consider to stock some of our books in the Bagh Bazar Math as well.

These ISKCON publications are very attractive to the public, they are nicely brought out, printed on the very best presses of America and Japan, and they are translated with commentary just to our line. One of my disciples from my Calcutta ISKCON branch will be calling on you shortly in this connection, and if you are kind upon me in this way, he will give you all facility and stocks for whatever you require.

I shall be myself coming to Calcutta by the 23rd instant of this month, just after we finish our Hare Krsna Festival and Bhagavata Dharma Discourses in the Cross Maidan of Bombay city, from January 12 to January 21, 1973. From Calcutta I will be leaving on February 1 for a one-month preaching tour of my several branches in Djakarta, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Philippines, and other places in Asia and the South Pacific zone. I shall return to Mayapur by the 1st March for celebrating the appearance day of our Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. I shall be staying in our Calcutta temple at 3 Albert Road for about 8 or 9 days, and we shall be lecturing and having kirtana program at various places in Calcutta proper each evening while I am there.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
