My dear Gaura Gopala dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6/11/74 and have noted the contents. My program in India is not yet fixed up. I may go out in December to Honolulu. Anyway Yasomatinandana dasa has written you to come, if he has written you to come, then you can come immediately with the Hindi typewriter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
