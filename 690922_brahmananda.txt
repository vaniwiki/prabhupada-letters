My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letters dated September 17th, 18th, 1969. Regarding the Rathayatra articles, Purusottama has sent you the article for San Francisco Festival, and by tomorrow most probably Gurudasa will send you an article about London Festival. So far as MacMillan is concerned, I have written to Gargamuni. Gargamuni is organizing book-selling, and perhaps you have received his memo to all temple presidents regarding selling our literature. So I am consulting with him before I finally decide about the MacMillan Company. But MacMillan's letter to you is not very encouraging. I have received the bank slips you have sent to me, and I hope by this time you have received the passbook. On hearing from you I shall advise you for changing the account to another branch. Regarding the length of the First Canto manuscript, you may write to Hayagriva, who is now in New Vrindaban. On the reverse side is a nice article of our arrival in London which was printed __The Sun,__ a very popular English paper.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
