My dear Dinatarini,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 29, 1973 and I have noted the contents. I have received also the photograph of Radha-Kalachandji and they are looking transcendentally beautiful. Always keep to this high standard of Deity worship, never become neglectful. Everything must be done very timely, and the temple must be immaculately cleansed daily. These things, cleanliness and promptness, are the most important points for Deity worship, so be very vigilant in this way.

So far opening a Gurukula in England, first let us establish our new building there, and we can talk later on. Meanwhile, continue your program there very nicely, and when there is good opportunity, I can come there for some time.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
