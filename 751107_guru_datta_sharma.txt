Dear Sriman Sharmaji:

Please accept my greetings. I am very glad to learn that your son Niranjana Datta Sharma is interested in our movement so much so that he wants to join. We are very eager to get educated men to push on our movement all over the world.

I cannot understand from your letter if your son is in India or abroad, but if he is in India then he may come immediately here to Bombay to see me personally.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
