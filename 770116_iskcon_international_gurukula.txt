ISKCON International Gurukula

To whom it may concern,\\
The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) has decided to introduce the gurukula system of education for the proper training of young boys in the traditional gurukula way laid down in the Srimad-Bhagavatam. This gurukula system will be gradually upgraded to the rank of a world university according to the ideas and ideals of ISKCON. ISKCON is in contemplation of opening their gurukula both at Vrndavana and Bombay and for this purpose Dr. S.B. Chatterjee, ex-professor and head of North Bengal University and Calcutta University, has already been requested to make on-the-spot surveys of ISKCON centers at Vrndavana and Bombay and to submit his recommendations for implimentation of this project of ISKCON at an early date when undersigned.

It is desired that Dr. Chatterjee will be keeping contact with the educational wing of the society
