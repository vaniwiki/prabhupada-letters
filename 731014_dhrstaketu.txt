====== Letter to: Dhrstaketu ======

Brooklyn

My dear Dhrstaketu Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 8, 1973 and have noted the contents. Regarding the money sent from New York, whatever comes to India, it is never returned. You know that India is celebrated as a poverty sticken country, so it knows how to receive, but not to repay. Anyway, I thank you for your contribution. It will be used for our Bombay temple. The balance money of your estate when you receive it, you can utilize for Krsna as you think best.

Our philosophy is that everything is Krsna's property, and everything should be used for Krsna's service. I instructed this philosophy to George Harrison, and he is trying to render service to Krsna in many ways. Recently you know he has given us our London temple, the cost being L220,000. Our devotees are very happily living there and the blessings of Krsna are going to George Harrison. So everyone of us should try to please Krsna and His devotee. Then our life is successful. Better to please His devotee first. That is a recommendation for being introduced to Krsna.

Regarding your question about instruction, spiritual life is different from material life. The instruction given in my books is supposed to be personal instruction. When we read the Bhagavad-gita As It Is, it is understood that we are receiving personal instructions of Krsna. No physical barrier is there in the case of spiritual affairs. It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam:

> sa vai pumsam paro dharmo
> yato bhaktir adhoksaje
> ahaituky apratihata
> yayatma suprasidati
> [[books:sb:1:2:6|(SB 1.2.6)]]

"The supreme occupation (dharma) for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendental Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self."

Regarding the morning kirtana songs, what you have given is all right. If time permits there are other songs that can be sung, such as jiva jago, udilo aruna "There is now sunrise on the Eastern horizon and Lord Caitanya accompanied by His devotees have started the morning Sankirtana party. . . ."

It is not that the individual jiva is within every atom, but paramatma is in each atom. It is stated in the Brahma Samhita as follows: __andantara-stham paramanu-cayam tarastham,__ "Who is situated within every atom. . ."

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
