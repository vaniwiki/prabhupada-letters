My dear Nityananda Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 5, 1975 and have noted the contents. The news clipping was nice. Regarding your festival of Ratha Yatra, you have got my blessings. Either with or without my presence, you will be successful, so do not worry.

I have seen your farm, and it is very nice. Develop it very nicely. You have already done nicely, so develop it further. That is very nice that you are saving money U.S. 250.00 per month on cow feed. Grow for animal and man food as far as possible. That is Krishna's order. annad bhavanti bhutani [[books:bg:3:14|(Bg. 3.14)]]. It is also nice that you are making so much profit from your Spiritual Sky. Use it wisely.

Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following disciples as initiated and their names are as follows: Thomas White---Padavja dasa; Henrietta Whelan---Jayaprada dasi; Katherine Kern---Kamarikanta devi; Jim Tucker---Jagatkarta dasa. I also accept for second initiation Sanatanai devi dasi. The mantra sheet is enclosed. I think you can inquire from Jagadisa about getting the tape. Hold a fire sacrifice amongst the devotees and let her hear the tape through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
