My S. K. Roy,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 7, 1974. Thank you for your kind sentiments and I am very glad that you have appreciated our International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Our actual credit is that we are simply repeating __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ without changing it, altering it or adding any mundane opinion. We simply repeat what previous acarya have said and that is our merit. Therefore it is being accepted all over the world. Thank you for appreciating our books. Please continue to read them. In regards to you becoming one of our life members I wish to refer you to Gargamuni Swami who is at our Calcutta Mandir at 3 Albert Rd. You can go and see him there and he will make some arrangement for you to become a member of our society. We have many different membership programs and he can discuss them all with you, and show you all the books we have been publishing, etc.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
