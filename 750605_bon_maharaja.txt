My dear Sripada Bon Maharaja,

Please accept my humble dandavats. When I was in Vrndavana, I was informed that you were staying in New York, but I do not know what is your address. Now, I understand that you are staying with Professor Joseph T. O'Connell. So, I am addressing this letter to his care and I hope you will receive it.

One of my disciples informed me that you had been in our Toronto temple. Now, I invite you to come to Hawaii. The climate is very nice here and I wish that we may pass a few days together in this nice climate.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your obedient servant,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
