My dear Rsabhadeva:

Please accept my blessings and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 7th of March. Yes, your Temple is always gathering nice devotees and I accept Brian, Leslie and Caroline as my duly initiated disciples and you can send the beads for chanting to Kirtanananda Swami, along with a copy of this letter.

Their new names are: Bhojadeva das, Taraka dasi and Mukhara dasi respectively. Now it will please me very much if you all can work together nicely and recruit many more young people to join our movement, it is their only future hope.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
