My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 31-5-73. I have noted the contents carefully.

Yes, if you have got the chance, you may come here to Mayapur to see me. I will be here for at least one month, so, if your exam schedule permits, then you can immediately come here. Come with Dr. Rao also. We have serious consultation.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
