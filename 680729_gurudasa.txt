====== Letter to: Gurudasa ======

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated 21 and 23 of July, and I am very glad to learn that some new devotees, boys and girls, are coming to the temple, and I request you to take care of them carefully. What about that boy, Patel? I do not hear about him.

Regarding London-yatra: Fifteen means including you and your wife. The calculation is 3 pairs from San Francisco, and 2 pairs from here. These 5 pairs is 10 heads. Myself is 1, so it is 11. And 2 or 3, utmost 4, Brahmacaris. So your name was never excluded; if you do not find your name mentioned, it is a mistake. So there is no reason for you to feel disturbed. I am very happy that you are putting the London plans into "full gear" now, and please do it, and as nicely as possible.

I very much appreciated your nice pictures and as well, the news clipping. It is all very much encouraging to me.

I hope both you and your good wife are well, and all is going nicely there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
