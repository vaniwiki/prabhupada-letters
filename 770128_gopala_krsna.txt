Dear Gopala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your report of January 25, 1977 and studied the contents.

I was especially pleased by the information that "The Hindi books are selling like hotcakes in Vrndavana." This is very good news.

I approve of the arrangement for the writing on the "Bhaktivedanta Swami Gate". Your dealing with the municipality men and hosting them at the temple shows you have done these things very nicely.

I have already sanctioned the expenditures for Gurukula, estimated at Rs. 1,800,000 which will include the Vrindaban gates and drainage.

As for foreign publications I also want books in the Orissan language.

Regarding the English edition of Srimad-Bhagavatam, I find the color reproductions are very good. You should also ask Tusta Krsna to order in New Zealand. The advertising for the English edition should be distributed to all government heads, state and Central. The Russian orders are very impressive. Yes, they can be given the books gratis; we do not want to exchange for Russian books.

On the whole, the report from Vrindaban and BBT is pleasing; just go on enthusiastically and Krsna will give you all intelligence how to manage affairs expertly. Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
