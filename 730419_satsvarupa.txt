My dear Satsvarupa Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 15, 1973 with enclosure of m/s. Narada Bhakti Sutra. . I have no objection to your publishing it, however there are many, many mistakes in the Sanskrit which have to be corrected, so I am returning the m/s. to you under separate cover. Regarding "Prayers of King Kulasekhara," I never said I was displeased with your publishing it in BTG.

Regarding Gurukula, it is not required that parents live there with there children. We can take care of the children, but not the parents. Any parents there must be engaged preaching and selling books, and going on the Sankirtana party. Mohanananda Prabhu has agreed to fully cooperate, now you just direct him. I just want that the children learn English and Sanskrit nicely, that's all. I want that things go on there nicely, it is so important work. If necessary I will come there myself to see how it is going, but only if the climate is suitable, neither too hot nor too cold. This Los Angeles climate is just suitable for me.

Regarding dancing, our dancing is ecstatic. We need not waste time 5 hours daily instead of chanting, for practicing. We are not professional dancers, neither we require it. These things should not be encouraged. In New York they have such activities, but they should not be going on in Gurukula.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
