====== Letter to: Caitya-guru ======

Bombay

My dear Caitya guru,

Please accept my blessings. I was very much shocked when I learned from Tamala Krsna Maharaja that you have left our company and were living outside. Anyway, I was always thinking of you and your letter of Jan. 26, 1974 gives me much relief. Why you should be sorry if someone says you are Indian, he is American, Indians are no good, Americans are good. Why be affected by bodily relationships? Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has advised us---and as an older, grownup student you should know it---that we have to become humbler than the blade of grass and more tolerant than the tree, and then we can execute our service and chant Hare Krsna.

If Indians are bad then I am also bad, as I am an Indian. But they have accepted an Indian as their guru. So Indians are both bad and good according to the behavior. If they have accused you as bad because you are Indian, yet they have accepted a bad Indian as guru. Don't be afflicted by all these external features of our bodily relationships. Be steady in Krsna Consciousness and do your duty so you may be blessed by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Krsna and make your life successful. I am going to Bombay on the 13rd instant---please come back and if you feel inconvenience, it doesn't matter whether from Indians or Americans, you can live with me because I am an Indian.

I hope you will feel no difficulty. You must come back when I go to Bombay. We are neither Indian or American; our real identity is that we are all servants of Krsna. Always remember this philosophy and all these external affairs will not trouble you. Hope this finds you in good health, and more when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
