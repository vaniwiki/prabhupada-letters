My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 19th June, 1970.

Regarding the picture of King Paundraka, Yes, he may be colored blue. Because he was imitating Vasudeva, he had two artificial extra hands attached also. So he might have painted himself blue also.

Your question from chapter 89 KRSNA is answered in the beginning of the 90th chapter.

I am very glad to learn about Giriraja's tricks for the imitation God. Just like expert business men make profit both ways, namely when the merchandise goes down by price or goes up by price. An experienced merchant makes profit both ways---when the price goes down, he purchases, and when the price goes up, he sells. So our Krsna conscious men should be transcendental business men, and Krsna gives the right intelligence how to deal with all classes of men.

The title for the Second Chapter of Second Canto, "The Lord in the Heart", is alright. In the cover picture, the footmark on the chest of the Lord should not be painted.

Regarding the Deities, although we were formerly advised that they were to be dispatched, we have just received news that they have been delayed in India pending some Government sanction. So you will be informed of Their arrival in due course.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
