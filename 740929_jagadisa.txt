Toronto

My dear Jagadisa das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram dated September 25, 1974 as follows:

REQUEST PERMISSION TO PURCHASE BUILDING IN TORONTO STOP PRICE 200,000 DOLLARS RENOVATIONS 100,000 DOLLARS STOP VERY REASONABLE FOR TORONTO CONSIDERING THAT PROPERTY COSTS IN TORONTO AMONG HIGHEST IN NORTH AMERICA STOP LOCATION SIDE LAYOUT PRICE ALL FEATURES EXTREMELY SUITABLE PLEASE REPLY IMMEDIATELY\\
JAGADISA

So, if suitable you can purchase this house immediately.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
