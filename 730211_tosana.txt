====== Letter to: Tosana ======

My dear Tosana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 25th. and have noted the contents carefully. Your dedication to Srimati Tulasi-devi is very laudable and I am sure that if you consult with Karandhara das he will give you all assistance to help make your dream come true. But carving __tulasi__ beads should not be your sole occupation. You should also go out for street __sankirtana__ and distribute my literature for the cripple minded masses, and whatever spare time you have you can carve some __tulasi__ beads for me to sanctify. But whatever you do should be done with wholehearted enthusiasm and strict adherence to the principles of chanting 16 rounds, rising for __mangala arati,__ following the four basic principles, always remaining clean etc. You may consult with Karandhara das and request him to approve your second initiation. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
