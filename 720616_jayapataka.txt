Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter dated May 29, 1972, from Mayapur and I have noted the contents. You have described the building progress there, but if you can send me photo then I can understand the situation as it is.

I have appointed Giriraja to be the GBC zonal secretary for India zone, and I am sure that he meets your requirements of being equipoised and considerate of all the needs of all the branches under his control or jurisdiction. Simply all you leaders there in India must cooperate with him nicely and give him confidence and advice how to manage the things in the best manner. So I suggest you address your ideas for managing to Giriraja and cooperatively make arrangements. Bombay should be the headquarters for India. You send all money there and when you require you take and they sould keep all accounts nicely. Whatever you need, they will supply.

Karandhara has sent telegram informing that upon receipt of your jointly signed requisition order, after you have received from Mr. Jayan as per our former transaction, then we shall issue a letter of transfer for the ten __Krsna Books__ as per your requisition order. But do not send the requisition before he has given you the money, first take the money there. If Tamala Krsna is not there he sould be informed. Among you three, including yourself, Tamala Krsna, Bhavananda, two of three must sign. It is better if all three sign.

If Tamala Krsna can do some tangible work in Bangladesh it will be advertised all over India and we shall be respected by all classes of men. So it is a crucial point in our progress, so make this Bangladesh program very nicely. My godbrother in Jessore will help him in every respect. His address is known to him.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
