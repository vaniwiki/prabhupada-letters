Dear Atreya Rsi Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 10, 1972 and have studied the contents carefully.

It is my wish that you work more and more closely with the ISKCON management. You have good intelligence and this should be engaged cent per cent in propogation of this movement of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. So you please go on increasing your involvement with the administration.

You speak of impersonalism. We welcome all impersonalists to come because if they are real impersonalists they will see that our Society is perfect and complete. Ramanujacarya is considered to be very stalwart acharya simply because he completely defeated the impersonalism of Sankaracarya. And even to this day in India, especially in the south, the followers of Ramanujacarya and Sankaracarya engage in talks and always the Sankarites are defeated. But most of the so-called impersonalists of today are rogues.

You may adopt this principle, that whatever conditions increases your facility to preach this Krishna Consciousness Movement should be accepted. If we accept this all of these discouragements etc. . . will disappear.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
