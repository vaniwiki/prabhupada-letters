My dear Mukunda Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that I am fixing my program for going to Nairobi from Bombay on November 23. From Nairobi I shall return to Los Angeles, so if you can arrange a meeting with the Pope then I can stop off there in Rome. So please inform His Holiness the Pope that I shall be returning to USA via Europe sometime after December 1, so if a meeting could be arranged at that time it would be very nice.

I am sending a copy of this letter to Dhananjaya in care of American Express, so you can consult with him and do the needful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
