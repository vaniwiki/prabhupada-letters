My dear Bhutatma das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter dated 11/17/71, and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. I have not heard your report from Fresno center for some time, so I am encouraged to see that everything is going nicely there under your supervision. Now upon the shoulders of you the leaders of this Movement falls the responsibility of practically saving this earth planet from the present dangerous position. So the work is in your hands. Let me be free now to translate books, that is my desire. You become very responsible and convinced of this our Krishna philosophy and if you maintain your purity then you will convince everyone else with this philosophy, that is our mission. Kindly assist me to please Lord Caitanya in this way, by spreading Krishna Consciousness or pure love of God, and know it for certain that by this work you shall very very soon go back to Home, back to Godhead.

I received one letter from a lady who lives in Fresno. She is a Catholic lady and she says that she attends our Fresno Temple sometimes. She has questions about her Catholic faith and our Krishna Consciousness, how they are related. I have replied her, but if she comes there, kindly give her all facility to understand. She is a nice lady. Her name is Miss Lucie Richter, 3320 E. Montecito, Fresno.

Enclosed please find three copies of Gayatri mantra and three sacred threads duly chanted on. Hold a fire yajna and give Gayatri mantra to Babusvar das, Gangarama das, and Bhagavat Acarya das. Karandhara has a tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra, so you can get this from him. One thing is that the tape should be heard through earphones into the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
