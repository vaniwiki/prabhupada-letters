My dear Sri Govinda Das (Bob Lindberg),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your very nice letter dated 21st May, 1970, along with a set of beads.

I am very glad to note your humble attitude, so keep this nice state of serving mood and your success is guaranteed in Krsna Consciousness.

So I am very happy to accept you as my initiated disciple, and your initiated name is Sri Govinda Das Brahmacari. I have chanted your beads duly and I am returning them to you enclosed herewith. Please continue as you have been following the regulative rules and principles strictly and always chant sixteen rounds of the Holy Names daily.

It is very good that you are presently engaged in assisting Bhagavan das by taking care of the treasury and distributing incense, you may continue to expand this engagement and at the same time learn thoroughly our Krsna Consciousness philosophy and how to apply it practically. You can take all help from Bhagavan das in these matters, he is a very qualified devotee.

Therefore do not waste even a moment of this rare opportunity of human form of life. Chant Hare Krsna, be always finding out some engagement in the service of the Lord, and be happy, and by the grace of Krsna you will be freed from all contaminations of this material condition and become fit for realizing the highest perfection of life, Krsna Consciousness.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am enclosing herewith one sheet listing the standard practices for a devotee and also the qualifications of a devotee.
