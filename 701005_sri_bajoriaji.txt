====== Letter to: Sri Bajoriaji ======

Bharata Sadhu Samaj\\
Bombay

Dear Sri Bajoriaji,

Please accept my greetings. In continuance of my telegram dated October 2nd, 1970, and letter dated October 3rd, 1970, I beg to inform you that although my party from London has reached there in Bombay, I am unable to join you there in Bombay because there was no arrangement for my passage. Therefore, if my disciples there can do the work, then I do not require to go to Bombay leaving aside my important engagements here.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
