My dear Balarama dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your two letters dated December 23rd and January 7th respectively, and have noted the contents. Enclosed please find a letter as you requested announcing my appointing Bali Mardan as GBC. Upon your recommendation, I am happy to accept Nakula dasa Adhikari for second initiation. Now hold a fire yajna, and play the tape into the right ear of me chanting Gayatri. Enclosed please find one sacred thread.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
