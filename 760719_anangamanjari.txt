My dear Anangamanjari,

Please accept my blessing. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 28, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

The best thing will be if you come here to New York and leave your situation there at Bombay. You are a very sincere devotee, that I know, and there are many nice girls here like Silavati who you can associate with. We have just had our Rathayatra here down Fifth Avenue and it was a grand success. It is a very nice field for expanding Krishna Consciousness and you will be very happy here I know. It is not advisable to marry again as this may disturb your former husband who is now engaged in preaching activities. So rather you can come here to New York where your service will be appreciated and there is very nice association with so many nice girls.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
