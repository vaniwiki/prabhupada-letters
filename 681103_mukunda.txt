My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard anything from you in about a fortnight, and I am anxious to hear how you are doing there. It may be there is some mail delay due to my leaving Seattle, for Santa Fe, and then coming here to Los Angeles. You can write me at the above address, my residential apartment. And you will be pleased to know that I am now accepted with the USA Immigration Department as Permanent Resident, with option to apply for citizenship. And yesterday's report of the activities of Sankirtana party is that they sold 175 copies of Back To Godhead, and collected 130 dollars in donations.

Hope you are all well there, and I shall be expecting to hear from you by return of post.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
