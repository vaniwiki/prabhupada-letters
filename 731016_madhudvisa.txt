====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 28, 1973 and have noted the contents. Regarding the initiations I accept the following devotee as my disciple:

Varaha murti das - Adrian.

Also enclosed please find the sacred threads for the gayatri initiations of Gopi Kanta das Brahmacari and Yasomatinanda das Brahmacari. So you can chant on the beads and hold the fire sacrifice amongst the devotees. The mantra should be heard from the tape through the right ear.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
