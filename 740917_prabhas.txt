My dear Prabhas das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter in Bengali. I request you to learn the doll making more perfectly, and when I shall go the the foreign countries by the month of April to New York, I will take you with me. In the meantime learn more perfectly the doll making.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
