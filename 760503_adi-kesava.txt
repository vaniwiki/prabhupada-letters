My dear Ādi Kesava Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 21, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care. Your plan to have the Rathayatra on July 18th, down 5th Avenue, is approved by me and I shall try to be there definitely. However make the carts very strong, not that while the procession is going on, the wheel breaks on the cart. It is better to have one first class cart. The cart in Philadelphia was done very nicely. If you are unable to make three strong carts, then make at least one very nicely. But, if you can make three very strong, then I have no objection.

Concerning the house in Delhi, I am surprised to hear that the State Department in Washington has not yet received our application from their Delhi office. I am herewith enclosing a true copy of the application with explanatory note to this effect. I want you to see that this is delivered to the proper person in Washington, and if possible you can arrange an appointment with him so that I can meet with him and finalize matters if possible when I visit Washington. I am tentatively scheduled to visit Washington, D.C. between the 2nd July (friday) and the 9th July (friday). If we can finalize this business during this time in my presence, that will be very nice. I shall likely remain here in Hawaii until the end of May, then I will be in Los Angeles for about 10 days. Please inform me of the outcome of your endeavours.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Please enclose one "Krishna Consciousness is Authorized" and one copy of the letter from Kenneth Keating to Gurudasa (if available) when you present the application to the State Department official in Washington.
