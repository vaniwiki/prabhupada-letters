====== Letter to: Devaprastha ======

Hong Kong

My dear Devaprastha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 4, 1974 and have noted the contents. I understand that you are now taking over affairs in Hong Kong. I received the letters from Bhurijana and have referred the matters to GBC, to Madhudvisa Maharaja. I regard Hong Kong as an important center and I agree with your statement very much that if the Chinese are approached intelligently they will become strong devotees, because their moral character and steadfast nature is very strong. As you know I was there recently although I did not see you then. I also observed this in the Chinese people and appreciated it very much. But we need experienced devotees, otherwise how are we going to maintain a center there. Now I know you are a experienced manager but sometimes you have left. So you are now enthusiastic to stay and manage. So do not leave anymore and stay, then it is alright. Please give me further reports on your communications with Madhudvisa Maharaja.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
