Dear Parasara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Sept. 9th, 1971. Due to my extensive travelling your letter has just reached me. I am in due receipt of your daksine offering. You please direct all your inquiries to Vishnu Jana Maharaj. He is fully qualified to direct you in all matters.

Your ever well wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
