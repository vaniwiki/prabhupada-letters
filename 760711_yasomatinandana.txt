Ahmedabad

My dear Yasomatinandana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your new Gujarati magazine with enclosed letter dated June 28, 1976, and I thank you very much.

Your program in Ahmedabad is very encouraging. Do it. Why not take the government land immediately. If you can publish these magazines you will get many supporters and sympathizers. If the order department in Bombay is not despatching the orders on literature to the foreign temples then you can sometimes go to Bombay and organize things. You are one of the trustees. You can organize it or have some professional shipping agent do it. Ahmedabad is such a big city. Aren't there any shipping agents there? Why from Bombay, why not from Ahmedabad?

The distribution results from the Rathayatra are very nice. There is no question of profit. Distribution is the first consideration.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
