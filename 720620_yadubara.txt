Bombay

My dear Yadubara,

I am in due receipt of your letter from Bombay dated June 14, 1972 and I have understood its contents. Today I have received one telephone call from Giriraja and he has informed me that there is some disagreement among you leaders there in our Bombay Center. This is not at all a pleasant situation for anyone. I am entrusting this huge task to all of you for working together cooperatively for doing something wonderful. I can understand that you are responsible and cool-headed along with the others, so you take the hand in reconciling all differences.

I have just now written to Gargamuni, Mahamsa, Nara Narayana, Giriraja as follows: "It is my request even you do not agree on some points, Giriraja is in charge so please follow his direction and that will please me. I am very much anxious to see the progress at Bombay Center, and I want it shall become the first class preaching center in the world. Please help me in this ambition. If we can manage successfully, we will be attractive for the whole of India. Our task is very heavy, do not neglect by paltry disagreement. I hope Krishna will bless you to understand my heart and oblige."

You state in your letter that everything is going on nicely there in Bombay, and I suppose that in general things are all right, but this todays news disturbs me and so I have ordered that Gargamuni shall immediately leave Bombay for his Gujarat tour and that Nara Narayana be given full assistance for extending the garden to all vacant areas of our property. Kindly assist me for seeing that these plans are carried out immediately and that our main task, namely, the construction work, shall not be neglected. This is very important matter.

You say that the Clairidge Press owned by Susheel Somani has offered to print our Gujarati magazine free of charge, and then you say that the cost will be not more than Rupees 3,000/-. How it is costing so much when the work is being done without any charge?

I hope this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have just now got one letter from Acyutananda Maharaja from Mayapur, and his plan is to photograph all of the original manuscripts of Bhaktivinode Thakura which are held by his son, Lalita Prasad Thakura, in Birnagar. This is a very, very important work, so I think you are just the right man for going there with Acyutananda to make photos of each and every page of the old manuscripts as they are in very bad condition. After taking the photos, we %%___%% shall be going to London on %%___%% 2, 1972, so send reply accordingly.
