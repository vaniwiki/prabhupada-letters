My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June, 1970.

We must stick to our Krsna consciousness business at all circumstances. This determination will make us successful. Although according to Vedic system there is restriction that boys and girls should not freely mix, the brahmacaris are strictly prohibited to talk with young women, but in the Western countries this rule is not valid. As such, we have to accept both boys and girls in the same standard. But if each of us follow the regulative principles and chanting of the mantras hardly there will be any chance for sex indulgence. So we have to be little careful about it and Krsna will help us.

I do not know why you wife has not yet got her visa.

The devotees who are trying to join our movement may be called by some Vedic name, but ultimately change of name will take place after first initiation. In the meantime there is no harm in calling them by some suitable good names.

Speaking or anything all depends on practice and study. I remember when I was first called for speaking by one of my senior Godbrothers. I felt very much hesitating because I was not practiced to speak. Later on by speaking and hearing or reading I got experience and now we can speak 45 minutes, 50 minutes or one hour at a stretch. So you have to read our books very nicely and gather thoughts, then you can speak for hours without any difficulty. It requires practice. So read your books carefully, especially __Nectar of Devotion__ now published, and practice speaking. It will be alright.

The complete edition of the Bhagavad-gita As It Is is not yet published. It will be published soon. If you cannot procure mustard seed oil, you may use olive or sesame oil.

The translating work cannot be transferred everywhere. It is not possible because for my regular work I require reference of the books which means I shall have to carry with me so many books and other things. So I have no objection to do this, but by such action the work will suffer. But I can go to Australia when you are fully equipped for some time and again come back. I have never seen Australia, so naturally I am inquisitive. But in that case you will have to provide for at least two men's double journey. I wish that your center may be strengthened more and more, and if by next January as you have stated you like me to go there, certainly I shall go for some time.

The actress girl, Janne, has arrived here. She has presented me one ballpoint pen, and she has also transferred travelers checks to the amount of $500 to the Society. She appears to be very nice intelligent girl, and we are trying to engage her for some dramatical performance on the basis of Lord Caitanya's pastimes.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
