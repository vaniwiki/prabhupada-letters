My dear Niranjana Das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 27 September 1972 and have carefully noted the contents. So, both you and Ramananda come to Vrndavana and I shall clear up everything. I am arriving there by the 15th of October. Our Vrndavana address is Radha Damodara Temple, Sevakunj, Vrndavana (Mathura), U.P., India.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
