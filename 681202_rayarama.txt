My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of November 29th, 1968 and have noted the contents. I am encouraged to read how Advaita, Uddhava and Subala are all doing nice work in spreading our Krishna Consciousness movement. This is very encouraging to me and please thank them along with your other press men assistants for the nice work and accomplishment they are doing.

The answer to your question about the marginal energy is that the jiva soul is always called marginal energy whether he is in the spiritual world or in the material world. There are instances where marginal energy jiva souls have fallen from the spiritual world, just like Jaya and Vijaya. So the potency to fall under the influence of the lower energy is always there. And thus the individual jiva soul is called as Krishna's marginal energy.

So far as the letterhead is concerned, yes, you may go ahead with this, but first you may send me a drawing of what you are planning to make.

Hope this finds you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
