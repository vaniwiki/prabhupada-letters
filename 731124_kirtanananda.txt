New Vrndaban

My dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. You may be pleased to know that on my way to U.S.A., Los Angeles via New York, I am now staying in London. I have just come yesterday 23rd November, 1973 from Nairobi. The fact is that I was to stay at Nairobi for at least one week, and there was very big arrangement for Hare Krsna festival. The wide circulation of advertisement was there, and it was expected some thousands of people will gather, but the immigration department by their confidential conspiracy did not allow me to enter into Nairobi. Therefore, from the Nairobi airport I immediately arranged to come to London, and last night at about half past eight London time I have come here at Bhaktivedanta Manor. I am feeling very much happy. Here everything is going on very nicely. It has given me much pleasure. Now when I go to New York I wish to meet both you and Hayagriva Prabhu, and if you so desire I can go from New York to your place for a few days. I have got important talks with you for development of our New Vrndavana project, so kindly get information from Bali Mardan Swami, and as seen as you hear that I am there, please come and see me with Hayagriva Prabhu. If you so desire, I shall go to New Vrndavana along with you. Hope this will meet you in good health. I offer my blessings to all the devotees there.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
