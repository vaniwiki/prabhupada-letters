Calcutta

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Presently I am in L.A. and very soon will be making my way back to Calcutta, and Mayapur, via Europe. First I will go to N.Y. by the middle of this month and then go London. From there I will go to Bombay and Calcutta.

So I am very much anxious to know about the arrangements being made for laying the corner stone in Mayapur. My desire is that it be done on the 15th August, 1971 or round about that day. If Indira Gandhi cannot come on the 15th August, then some other day will be all right. But the ceremony must take place. So please let me know the latest development. I am anxious for your reply.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Also the brass pair of Radha Krishna Murtis meant for L.A. has no trace as yet. Whether Jayapataka has shipped them or not. Inform this matter by wire & oblige. L.A. temple is going on __very nice.__ ACB __Important__\\
