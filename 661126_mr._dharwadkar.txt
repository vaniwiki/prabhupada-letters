Dear Mr. Dharwadkar,

Please accept my greetings. Kindly refer to your letter of the 26th February 1966.

If you have not been able to sell all the books left with you for sale, you may kindly return the books to

Srimati Morarji (Sumati) of Scindia House Dougall Road, Ballard State, Bombay.

Or if you think you shall be able to sell them you can keep the books on sales account and in that case you will please immediately hand over two sets of Book (Srimad-Bhagavatam) to Srimati Sumati Morarji as abovementioned and oblige.

I shall be glad to receive from you a statement of account for Books sold and amount deposited with the Bank

Kindly treat this as urgent and oblige.

Awaiting your early reply and thanking you in anticipation.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
