====== Letter to: Ajita ======

Stockholm

My dear Ajita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 4/1/74, along with the new publication in Swedish of my English work, "Krsna Consciousness the Topmost Yoga System". Of course I cannot read Swedish, but looking through this book has given me unlimited bliss. After all, this is my prime duty, to publish books on Krsna Consciousness. The printing of the book appears excellent, and that you are "profusely distributing" the book all over Sweden is the crowning success of our movement. We will conquer Europe with these books. I can only thank you again and again in sincere gratitude for producing this literature, and pray to Krsna to bless you with all spiritual advancement.

I am planning to go to Paris, France in the second week of May, and while I am there I can also visit you in Stockholm. Let me know if you can arrange a meeting at the university for that time and then I shall be able to go and join you in spreading Krsna Consciousness to the people of Sweden.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
