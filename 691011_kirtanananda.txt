My Dear Kirtanananda, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated October 2, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. Regarding your question about who shall get the money that is collected by you and your assistant, Jimmy, I think that because practically a sannyasi belongs to every center whatever is collected should go to the same center where you are staying. That is best. But this question may be settled in the meetings held between all the temple presidents. If you collect something where there is no center, that money you can take to your own center, New Vrindaban. But I think that all these matters should be settled amongst yourselves with the presidents of different centers. Now as we are growing in magnitude we should managed things in such a nice way that there may not be any misunderstanding between one center and another. That is my request. Everything should be done on the basis of mutual agreement. So far my opinion is concerned, any amount collected from a particular center should go to the center. That means if you collect anything while in Columbus center, that should go to Columbus center, and similarly if you are in some other center. I am very pleased to learn that Jimmy has sent me his beads to be chanted upon. I have not received them yet, but when I do, under your recommendation he shall be duly initiated.

(hand written) I have received his contribution $25.00.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
