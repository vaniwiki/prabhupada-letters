My dear Govardhan Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 7, 1973 and am pleased to accept the following students as my initiated disciples: Triyogi dasa (Mike Slockman); Udayananda dasa (Randy Cieslak); Yajnavalkya dasa (James Schwartz); Visalaksa dasa (Robert Richardson); Nistraigunya dasa (Steven Forbes); and Madhyma dasi (Marsha Farmer). The sacred trread for the second initiation of Indrabarta dasa is also enclosed. So you please inform Satsvarupa Maharaja to do the needful for chanting on the beads and hold a nice sacrifice. Thank you for the nice letters from the students, and I am glad that you are appreciating this Krishna Consciousness Movement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
