My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 5/11/76.

Yes, if there is no difficulty to finalize the fixed deposit later we can wait until I come to Bombay.

Regarding the Gita Pratisthan conference, will they pay for my going or not? Talk to Bajaj personally about it, his secretary is useless. When he returns speak to him. If they do not pay we will not take a sankirtana party. But, if we can transport in our own bus, then we can do.

It is good that our friends are coming forward to help in Bombay. Let them present a statement that it is a genuine movement. All Indians are interested in spreading this movement. Krsna is accepted as the Supreme Lord by all Indians. His birthday ceremony, Janmastami, is observed by all Indians. In Bombay there is an embassy branch. Our Bombay friends should go there to express their protest.

Encourage Dr. Jhawer, I know he is very enthusiastic. Mohata can give lots of help. One thing, is the sanction there for our Gurukula construction?

That newspaper article is very nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
