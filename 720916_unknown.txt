__All Glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga!__

Dear

Please accept my most humble obeisances at your feet. Prabhupada just spoke with me regarding the distribution of foreign (other than English) language literature. His direction is that 10% of the gross income on the sales of all of our literatures, books, and magazines, should be sent to The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. The BBT is financing many world-wide projects for the society, and therefore all income from literature distribution should contribute and support it. Please therefore make the necessary arrangements. A simple way to accomplish this would be to figure at the end of each month what your gross (total; before subtracting production costs and overhead) income from the sale of literature was for that month, calculate 10% of this figure , and send this to BBT in care of myself in Los Angeles. I know that you will understand that this subsidy will greatly facilitate the growth of Society-wide programs and everyone will benefit. From your local view it may appear to be an imposition, but I assure you that overall it is in the interest of Lord Caitanya's Movement. Regarding your regular remittance, it will be left solely to your integrity and "for the overall benefit" conscientiousness. I am sure you will do the needful.

Also, regarding the sale of translations to outside publishers (which we hope to do with the Bhagavad-gita As It Is for Spanish, French, and German) 50% will go to the local Center which did the actual translating and 50% will go to the Book Trust, as per Prabhupada's directions.

If you have any questions or points to make, please correspond with me.

Haribol.

Your Servant,\\
Karandhara das Adhikari
