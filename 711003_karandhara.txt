My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed you will find one photograph of the Deities there in L.A. recently sent to me. Why is Krishna without a flute? What is the difficulty to make for Krishna a flute? You can take a twig and wrap it in golden lace with a pearl drop hanging. That is a flute; how long it takes to make? Nothing should be concocted; not that a flower in place of a flute.

I think you have already advised N.Y. to send the full manuscript for Bhagavad-gita As It Is to Dai Nippon. If not you can advise them immediately.

Enclosed also you will find one letter from Kunjabihari das Brahmacari. So four times he has left the society; that is not very good record. So he is asking for second initiation. Let him stick to L.A. temple under your care for at least six months and then he will be eligible. Piece of Govardhana Hill cannot be taken from Vrindaban.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
