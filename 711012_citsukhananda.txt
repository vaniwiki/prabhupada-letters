My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 29th September, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am very glad to see that Candrabali and your son have returned to you again. It is very good. Husband and wife, there may be some disagreement but it should not be taken at any time very seriously. So combinedly together, go on with your preaching work.

I am so much pleased that you have got a nice place. I shall try to go to your center at my first opportunity. Some time back I went to Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is a nice small city. I think Santa Fe is near Albuquerque. These tracts of land are full of hills.

I quite follow the situation prescribed by you, and all these yogis are mostly bluffers. They have no substance to give. You can openly declare this fact. Try to distribute our books very widely and preach also. These bogus yogis and swamis will vanish.

It is very good that you have registered the society. It is very important. Actually we are not a religious institution. We are presenting a cultural program, making men of good character. Therefore it is a cultural institution. We are also registered here in Nairobi as International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Ltd. Many people are becoming our life members also and we have collected over 30,000 shillings and are trying to find out land where to locate ourselves.

One thing is that all translations should be checked by you and Candrabali because those who are not our students, if they write some wrong conclusion, the whole thing will be murdered.

The prose and appreciations are very nice. Thank you very much. It is all being sent to Satsvarupa for future publication after examination. Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
