My dear Dr. Yogi Raj Dev Svarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Nil. In thank you very much for your kind appreciation. Because you are teaching in a respectable University I request you to study some of my books, especially Bhagavad-gita as it is. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, manah samyamya mac-citto, yukta asita mat parah "One should meditate upon me (Krishna) within the heart and make me the ultimate goal of life." [[books:bg:6:13-14|(Bg. 6.13-14)]]. Western people are now becoming more and more interested in yoga practice, but unfortunately because they have no authorized source of information, they are being mislead by unauthorized teachers and concocted methods of yoga practice. Actually the astanga yoga system practiced thousands of years ago is not practical for this age, therefore Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu introduced the simple process of chanting the Holy name of Krishna for the people of this fallen age of Kali. It is said in the sastras that the same result that was formerly attained by difficult sacrifices or yoga practice is easily achieved in this age simply by chanting the Holy name of God, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.

In all our temples we are doing that, and we have more than 40 big volumes of authorized books, Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad gita, etc. Intelligent people are accepting this movement all over the world, so if you are serious about joining this mission, then why not study these books, understand the philosophy and teach.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
