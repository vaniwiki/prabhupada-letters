My dear Radhavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter addressed to Brahmananda Maharaja dated November 26, 1974 and I am glad to learn that the situation in New York is proper again. Thank you very much. So now do everything nicely and cooperate together, and keep everything purified. That is the brahminical qualification, truthfulness and cleanliness, __satyam__ and __saucam.__ These are the first qualifications. Then controlling the mind and the senses, simplicity, full knowledge, and practical application of knowledge, and faith in the Vedas and the spiritual master. Those who are initiated by the brahminical thread, their first duty is to maintain cleanliness and truthfulness. I hope you can understand the importance of this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
