My dear Srimad Vamana Maharaja and Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my respectful obeisances. I am now staying in Japan at the above address in connection with printing work of some of my important books and magazines.

I beg to thank you very much for sending me a copy of your Sri Caitanya Panjika. I have received it just yesterday redirected from Los Angeles.

In future if you kindly send such Panjikas, please send it my air mail otherwise it takes four to five months to reach and sometimes it gets lost.

Please offer my dandabats to all the Vaisnavas.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
