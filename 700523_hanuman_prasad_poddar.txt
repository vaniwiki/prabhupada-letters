My dear Bhaiji Hanumanprasada Poddar,

I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 15th May, 1970. I am very glad to learn that some article has been published in your esteemed paper "Kalyana" regarding my activities, and I thank you very much for this. I have not seen the article as yet because if you have sent the specimen copy by ordinary post, then it will take about four months to reach here. If therefore you send me one copy by air mail, it will be a great pleasure for me.

Regarding the translation of __Krsna Consciousness,__ I think the following lines either in Bengali or in Hindi will be alright.

Yours in the service of the Lord,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. As you have asked for my suggestion, I would request you to formulate a scheme so that our Indian brothers interested in Krsna Consciousness may join this Movement and send many preachers all over the world. There is a great necessity of qualified preachers. So far Krsna Consciousness philosophy is concerned, it is now tested by my last three years' experiment that this philosophy will be accepted in any part of the world irrespective of caste, creed, color, and language.

Besides that, many of my students are eager to go to India, but I have no place of my own in India to accommodate them. If suitable place can be obtained, at least 40 American and European students may immediately go to India and preach this cult in colleges, schools and universities, and other public meeting places. I will be glad to know if you can help me in this matter.

By separate air mail I am sending several news articles, out of which my talks with Dr. J.F. Staal, Professor of Philosophy and of South Asian Languages, University of California, Berkeley, will be very much interesting to you. So we are gradually being appreciated by all classes of men. The above picture is our newly purchased building as I informed you before.

A.C. B.S.
