My dear Tripurari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 14/10/76 along with a copy of National Geographic magazine.*

Please go on with your program, preaching and distributing my books, encouraging others to remain pure by following our simple program of chanting, reading, Deity worship, etc. Krsna will certainly help you. Keep yourself always engaged in the service of Gaura-Nitai and that will keep you liberated from material contamination.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
