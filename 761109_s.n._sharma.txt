====== Letter to: S. N. Sharma ======

My dear S.N. Sharma,

I am in receipt of your letter dated 6/11/76 and have noted the contents carefully.

Yes, if you want to give us this land we shall be willing immediately to invest in developing a project there. We have long been interested in developing something in Delhi, but we were waiting for the opportunity. What Krishna preaches is meant for the weaker section. If they feel weak and abide by my direction, it is not my direction, it is Krishna's, they can be raised to the standard of the most exalted persons, even if they are all fools and rascals. The teaching is very simple, "__man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru__" [[books:bg:18:65|(Bg. 18.65)]]. Even a child can do it. Even the weakest child can do it if he is trained up. Let all the weaker section come to me. I shall train how to become first class men by chanting Hare Krishna Maha mantra and be fit for Krishna consciousness. That will solve all their problems. It is doing practically all over the world. I don't think there is any other institution throughout the whole world which can take charge of a weaker section and raise them to the standard of most exalted persons.

We have no business with Tagore's Gitanjali. We are simply interested in spreading Krishna's Gita. When the greatest author, Krishna, is there, there is no need of bringing smaller author. When there is brightest sunshine, there is no need of bringing small lamp. When there is brightest moonshine, there is no need of bringing glowworm. This is our principle. If you want to write something, read our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ carefully and write something simple to benefit the common people. In Gitanjali there is a little hint to surrender to the Supreme.

Faithfully yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
