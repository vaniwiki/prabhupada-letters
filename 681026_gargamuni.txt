My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my greetings and blessings of Lord Krishna. I am in due receipt of your letter of 10/18/68. I am very much perplexed to know that you are not feeling comfortable at the care of your parents. If your parents don't receive you as their beloved son, I don't wish to keep you in that blazing fire. I thank you very much for the strength of your mind and Krishna will certainly help you. You will be pleased to know that I have now immigration visa for your country and if I get the church-centre room in U.N. I am going to make my H.Q. in N. York. If your parents don't treat very well & want to make your life miserable, then you shall live with me. At least I shall not make your life miserable even though I am not as rich as your parents. If your father does not give you facilities for a car and good apartment. I don't advise you to live in that blazing fire. Hope this will meet you in good health. I am going tomorrow to Santa Fe and then to Los Angeles.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
