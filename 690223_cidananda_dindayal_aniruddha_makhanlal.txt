My dear Sons, Cidananda, Dindayal, Aniruddha and Makhanlal,

Please accept my blessings. I have duly received all of your elaborate letters, and there are so many points to reply, it will take time to reply you properly. In the meantime, my request to you is that you take very seriously our program of __Back to Godhead,__ and, as you have promised to contribute your quota of $750 per month against delivery of 5,000 copies of __Back To Godhead,__ I am so much obliged to you all.

Now, who will work and who will not work that is consideration between yourselves. It is local affairs, and how can I advise you that one is to do something and another is to do something. Neither you should depend upon me for such local administrative business. All of you are sincere devotees pledged to the missionary activities, so you should sit together and decide what to do and what not to do.

But I am begging from you $750 per month against 5,000 copies of Back To Godhead. Out of this 5,000 copies, if you simply sell 1,500 copies you immediately realize your $750. The balance of 3,500 copies will be in your hands. If you can sell them at any price, not less than 30 cents per copy to stores, then whatever amount you realize will be clear profit for the Temple. If still there is some balance copies, then these copies we can distribute free by post to heads of the society, schools, colleges, libraries, and so many other institutions. So we have to make a list of them, and take concession rates from the post office. In this way we can make vigorous propaganda with __Back to Godhead.__ Besides that, if you can introduce Sankirtana and classes and __Back to Godhead__ in Berkeley, that will be another great advantage.

So I am reading your letters carefully and I shall answer them duly. In the meantime, you consider my appeal and do the needful jointly. For Aniruddha my instruction is that immediately there is no program in New Vrindaban because unless there is suitable houses for residence, we can not begin any work there. So I have instructed Hayagriva to make houses first. Then we can consider programs for going there. Now there is other important matters such as __Back To Godhead__ which we should try for.

I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
