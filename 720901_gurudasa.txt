Vrindaban

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram as follows: "Bharatpur Trust will donate Kesighat Temple will sell surrounding rooms and garden we must offer price wire immediately." So I have received this telegram and have replied by telegram as follows: "Why not donate the whole thing and we spend money to make super gorgeous. Otherwise how we can offer without knowing details and site plan of temple? Rush them New Vrindaban." So the thing is if I do not know how much land is there, what is the condition, what is the price, what are the terms, how I can make concrete offer? That is not good businesses. So you can send me immediately everything, the site plan, what are the exact terms of the contract, etc., then we shall see. I think that is a very grand temple, and we shall be able to utilize it if the other party is willing to help us. But one thing is, why they cannot donate the whole thing and we shall spend our money to make it very wonderfully done up and renovated. But I think their plan may be to give us the temple only, because that cannot be sold, and no one can maintain it any more, and then we shall have to buy the residential buildings, the compound all the other buildings there, and that is their trick to get money for those buildings, by so-called offering us the temple without having to pay anything for it, because they cannot sell it anyway.

So Bhavananda is coming there in a few days, and Tamala Krishna is coming with one engineer, so conjointly you three men consider everything with these points in mind and do the needful. If you all three big men think that it is a good bargain, then you may offer as you think best, but consulting with me first. But one thing is, what we shall do with the land in Raman Reti? How to utilize it if we purchase the Kesighat temple? I am remaining in New Vrindaban at least until 8th September, after that you may write me in Los Angeles.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
