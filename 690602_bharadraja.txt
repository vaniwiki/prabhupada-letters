My dear Bharadraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 28, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I can understand that you are having some difficulty in finding time to paint because of your other duties, but I think that all of these duties may be stopped so you can devote your full energy and time to painting. This painting you are doing is very important, so it will count as your temple work. There is no necessity either for you to go out on Sankirtana if this will take away your time from your real work. I understand that you are also very musically talented, but this talent is not so much required on Sankirtana Party because for chanting Hare Krishna it is not necessary that all instrumentation be so much polished or complicated. If it is necessary for you to work part time to earn money for artist supplies then you should do it, or else if Isana das can continue to help you in this connection, that will be better. Both you and your wife, Rukmini, are very nice artists, so please tell me what ideas you have so that you may get as much artistic work done as possible.

For the time being, you should complete your Sankirtana painting, and then as you have asked about the __Krishna Book,__ I an enclosing an idea for a painting of Krishna showing the universe within His mouth to Mother Yasoda. So you may complete this painting also as soon as possible. I have so many ideas for paintings, and we will be requiring so many expert paintings as you are able to do, so please be very serious to do this work nicely and quickly. It will be great service. In our __Krishna Book__ we are showing the Western World for the first time what is God. So it is no unimportant task, and try to help us out in this as far as possible.

I hope this will meet you in good health

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
