My dear Balai,

Please accept my blessings. It was a great pleasure to receive your letter of January 14, 1969. I hope that by the Grace of Krishna you will have a very nice child next month, and my blessings are always there.

You have wished me to live until all of my publications are finished, and I thank you very much for these good wishes. May it be fulfilled by the good will of all of my disciples. Thanking you again for your kind letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
