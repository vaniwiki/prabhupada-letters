====== Letter to: Suresvara ======

New Vrindaban

Dear Suresvara das;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Sept. 19 and have noted the contents carefully.

I have just received it along with other mail which was forwarded from London. I am in due receipt of your $5.00 daksina, and I thank you very much. The verses of the Gita have a specific melody but you may choose a suitable tune. Most important is that the melody remains very simple. You can take further direction from Kirtanananda Maharaja regarding these matters.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
