My dear Panalalji:

Please accept my blessings. I would like to thank you for the Rs. 15,000/- that you have pledged towards the construction of the Hyderabad temple. I am also pleased to hear from Mahamsa Swami that the construction has started and the columns have come to beam level.

Since you are the most elderly devotee, I request that you please overlook the construction and fund raising from time to time.

If the temple is completed by the coming Janmastami, I will come for the installation ceremony.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
