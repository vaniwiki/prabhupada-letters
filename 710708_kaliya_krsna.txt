My dear Kaliya Krishna Das (John Moffat),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter dated 5th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Yes, I am so glad to accept you as my duly initiated disciple, as you were recommended highly by Sriman Bhagavan dasa Prabhu. I have given you the spiritual name Kaliya Krishna Das Brahmacari. Kaliya Krishna was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya. Similarly you become a great devotee of Lord Caitanya and help Him to push on this movement to every nook and corner of the globe. Then Caitanya Mahaprabhu will be very much pleased upon you and your life will know success.\\
Actually Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, or Krishna, doesn't need our service. He is completely self sufficient. What service we can do for him? But if we are sincerely trying to render some service, it is to our benefit, and He becomes pleased with us also. Just like the father, when he receives some service from the son. What service he requires from the such very young boy? Yet, still because it is done out of natural affection, the father is so much appreciative. So that is our position. We should never think that oh, my service is so much valuable to Krishna; I am performing such nice service. No. But we must take our service seriously because it will be to our benefit and Krishna will be pleased. That's all.

So go on as acting treasurer in Detroit center and see to it that the temple remains financially fit and in all cases depend on Krishna. Chant your 16 rounds of beads without fail and always think of Krishna. Then surely you will be blessed by Krishna in all respects.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
