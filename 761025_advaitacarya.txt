My dear Advaitacarya,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter undated.

You are taking care of the cows. That is cow puja. Don't bother with anything else. Keep yourself in Krsna consciousness by strictly observing the regulative principles and chanting sixteen rounds. Always keep engaged in Krsna's service.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
