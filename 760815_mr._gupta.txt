Dear Mr. Das Gupta;

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 7th August 1976 and have noted the contents. I am going to New Delhi by the end of the month. You can come there and take information.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
