My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 2, 1968, and noted the contents very carefully. I am so glad to learn that the New York devotees are all feeling my separation and you are feeling also; this is very blissful. In the transcendental platform, actually separation is more relishable than meeting. But either separation or meeting, the state is always absolute. Actually in the spiritual platform, there is no separation, but it is a different stages of __rasas.__

So far service to Krishna is concerned, it is variegated. Krishna has got multi-energies, therefore, He can receive services from us in multi-forms. So anyone can render loving service to Krishna by his talents, that is the technique of Krishna Consciousness. So by the Grace of Krishna, you have got the talent and you have got the opportunity also to serve Him, and I wish that Krishna may give you more and more such opportunity to make your progress in Krishna Consciousness. I have already written to Uddhava about binding and size of the book, and again I am repeating that all my books shall be printed in the size 6 1/2 x 9, but next printing, I am willing to do it, canto by canto. That is to say, the three volumes already published of Srimad-Bhagavatam maybe printed in one volume. And the paper should be that Indian thin paper. And the pages shall not be less than 1000. Of course, the composition all in Roman type, we shall avoid not the Sanskrit type. Simply we shall put transliteration, translation, and purport. In this way volumes 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. 12 volumes, of Srimad-Bhagavatam will be published. So we can do the needful. And so far Back To Godhead is concerned, it is already known to you how to do it.

Regarding binding: Some of our students also may learn the art, and so far I know, binding cost should not go beyond 40 cents. Please inform Balai dasi with my blessings, that I have received the report of the Istagosthi, and it is very nice. Especially the portion in which Rayarama and Purusottama's presentation to deal with newcomers is very nice. We should not disturb the newcomers immediately with opposite proposals, but tactfully we shall try to teach him in our ways, and gradually he will come to understand this policy is very nice, and approved by me.

Hope you are both well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
