My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters both dated 26th May, 1970.

So I was sure that you could not allow anyone to sit on the Vyasasana, and therefore when I read your statement I was little surprised. Anyway, that is alright.

I hope your arrangements for Rathayatra festival are going on and Yamuna devi is taking nice care of the Deities. I can understand from the record album that your devotional feelings have improved. So keep this standard intact. In India the "Kalyana" magazine has published a nice description of our movement, and they have very much appreciated about my regulative principles. So keep this standard rigidly intact so the Indians may not be able to criticize in the matter of managing our temples. I am sure if you simply follow the instructions I have already given there will be no difficulty.

Sometimes back I wrote you if the government can give us land in the Regent Park for constructing a big temple on the Indian style. I have not received any information about it. If possible try and get the information.

I have not heard from Mukunda for a long time. Please keep me informed at least once in a fortnight about the good progress of your temple. KRSNA book will be ready by Rathayatra festival. When you take the procession on the street, always keep our books and magazines ready for distribution.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
