My dear Kapurji,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter dated April 2, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care. Concerning the Chitra Studio, I very much appreciate your offering and I am sending Gopala Krishna das Adhikari along with one of our experienced photographers and filmmakers, Yadubara das Adhikari. They will surely arrive within the next couple of days and do the needful in this connection on my behalf. Thank you very much.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
