My dear Uddhava and Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter of January 11, 1968, and am pleased with your sincere service attitude. We are all conditioned souls so we are affected by Maya, but if we sincerely chant and serve, our attachment for Krishna will be revived and we will no more have to come under this Maya. Eternally we will be serving the Lotus Feet of the Supreme Lord.

I am obliged to you for your sincere service in Krishna Consciousness. Please both of you join with Gargamuni in the new center and with greater enthusiasm. Hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
