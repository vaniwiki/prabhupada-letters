My dear Nayana Bhirama,

Please accept my blessings. Regarding your article in Back To Godhead about Ayurvedic Medicine, I do not think this is very worthwhile endeavor. You have shown nice ability for writing so it will be more appreciated if you continue to study Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita and express the same by your assimilation. We have enough Krishna Consciousness matters to discuss so there is no need of wasting time with such topics as Ayurvedic Medicine.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
