My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated October 28 in which you propose to go with your good wife, Indira Dasi, to St. Louis for opening a Krishna Consciousness center. The proposal is very nice so you try for it. I have all approval. Please keep me well informed of your progress in this scheme. I hope that Lord Krishna will give both of you all necessary strength to execute this service nicely.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
