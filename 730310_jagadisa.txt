My dear Jagadisa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 1, 1973 and I have carefully examined the contents.

Actually, Hayagriva was not doing any managing or editing of BTG except for his own articles. More importantly he was engaged in working on our books, producing those smaller paperback booklets, etc. Such a talent is not so easily replaced, so we must try to bring him back to the standard for his own benefit. In this connection, I have written his wife, Kirtanananda Maharaja, and the GBC to see what they can do for him.

Now I think that you can join me as the next GBC secretary for travelling with me by my side. If I go to New York in the first week of April you can meet me there, or if I go to South Africa you can meet me first here in India. What do you think? If there is some difficulty kindly let me know immediately.

I hope this meets you in good health and transcendental mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
