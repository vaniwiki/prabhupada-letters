====== Letter to: Prabhusvarupa ======

Haridasapur

My dear Prabhusvarupa Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 4/12/76.

Regarding the construction of the boundary wall you may consult with Jayapataka Swami and Bhavananda Goswami. They'll do the needful, I have already advised them. Please work very closely with them in all matters.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

very soon I shall go to Bombay and send you the new plan.\\
