Manipur

My dear Svarupa Damodara dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 3, 1974 and have noted the contents. So it is very good your preaching there in Manipur. This is your duty. By the grace of Krsna you have got a position in the education field, doctor of chemistry. When you will present our philosophy the educated circle will have to listen. They cannot neglect. So when ever you speak, speak scientifically about Krsna's existence. %%_%% is the background of the cosmic manifestation. This is a fact. Unfortunately because people have become demoniac, Krsna is not realized, __naham prakasha sarvasya.__ He is not exposed to the nondevotee. Our mission is to turn the people to become devotees so that they can see Krsna. As it is stated in the Isopanisad, __niranmayena patrena satvasyapihitam mukham.__

So we have got a great mission. You are one of the strong pillars of the mission. So I have all confidence in you. Follow strictly all our rules and regulations. Be fully strong to push on this cult amongst the educated scientific circle. That you are getting many speaking invitations is a good indication. Take advantage of this. Krsna is asking you to do this job. The people there are naturally Krsna conscious, and when you present more scientifically, then will be convinced.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
