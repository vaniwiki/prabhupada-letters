Dear Ramesvar:

Please accept my humble obeisances. Your letter dated October 20, 1974 has been received and I have been asked by Srila Prabhupad to enquire who has had this document prepared without Srila Prabhupad's authority being given? It is understood from Bali Maradan that it has taken over one year to prepare this document at a cost of of Dollars 10,00.00. Who has ordered this money to be spent and who has paid for it?

When this questions are answered, Then Srila Prabhupad will reply your letter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your Servant,

Brahmananda Swami

Personal Secretary
