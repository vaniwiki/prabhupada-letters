My dear Nityananda das,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received one note from Brahmananda which informs me that your original set of beads was lost in the mail and did not arrive in the packet with your letter of initiation. Brahmananda has sent one set of new tulsi beads, and I have duly chanted upon them and I am sending them to you enclosed herewith.

I hope you are doing well in Buffalo under the guidance of Rupanuga Prabhu. Please be sure to chant at least sixteen rounds of the Holy Name daily and be happy.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
