====== Letter to: Gurudas ======

My dear Gurudas,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter (undated), and I am so glad to see he photo album sent by you. But I have not received any newspaper clippings regarding the procession-neither I have received the 2 slides which you mentioned in your letter under reply. (you mentioned 2 slides, one of Lord Jagannatha and one of the car) You write to say that there was one article in the San Francisco Examiner on July 1, 1968, but I have received none till now. Please try to send one copy as soon as possible. You will know about my plan about London-yatra from the letter which I am addressing today to Shyamsundar. I am so much satisfied with your successful performance of Rathayatra festival and I am awaiting to see similar festivals in all our other centers, including one in the prospective London center. Hoping you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
