My dear Tulsi das:

Please accept my blessings. I have received your request for initiations and I accept the following as my disciples and their spiritual names are as follows: Robin West---Rathagrahi dasa; David Moore---Disa dasa; and Dorrie Winham---Dharmada devi dasa.

I also accept the following as twice born brahmanas and their threads are enclosed duly sanctified: Citraka dasa, Ameyatma dasa, Guruttama dasa, Urjasvat dasa, Padmahara dasi, Manya dasa, Parvata Muni dasa, Nikunjavasini dasi, Krsna Lauliya dasi, Caitanya Simha dasa, and Racitambara dasi.

Now hold a fire sacrifice and impress upon them that they are taking vows before Radha Krsna, the spiritual master and the assembled Vaisnavas. It is a serious business.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
