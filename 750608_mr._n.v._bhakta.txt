Box 130, Nelola\\
Zambia, Africa

My dear Mr. Bhakta,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21-5-75 and have noted the contents. I can go to Zambia at any time by my secretary's arrangement. So, Brahmananda Swami, my chief secretary, is coming to meet me in Los Angeles on the 20th of June, and then he can give you reply as to when I shall be coming to Zambia.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
