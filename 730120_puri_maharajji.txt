My dear Puri Maharajji,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter dated January 5, 1973 is in hand, and I thank you very much for your kind sentiments. I am going to Calcutta on 23rd instant and we shall remain there until February 2nd, giving programs each night at different places in Calcutta. Then we are gong to Australia and New Zealand for one month, returning to Mayapur by first of March. So if you are able to meet me either in Calcutta or Mayapur, I shall be most happy to see you again and I think that we have got many things to discuss.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
