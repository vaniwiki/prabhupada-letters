====== Letter to: Rupanuga ======

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of December 15, 1968 and have noted the contents with much satisfaction and encouragement. This accredited course which you have attained at the University of Buffalo is a very nice breakthrough for Lord Caitanya's movement in the West. Please do this very carefully and seriously and I am sure that Lord Caitanya will give you the intelligence from within to successfully execute this new, important project. I think that under your expert guidance many of the students in your class will eventually understand something of the great importance of what you are teaching. By Krishna's Grace perhaps the more intelligent will also decide to join you and help you. I am handing over the course proposal which you have sent me to Hayagriva who is here in Los Angeles with me. He is planning to attempt a similar course in the University of Ohio. So if we can teach to the college students in this way surely it will be a great boon to our society. You have laid ground work for this project and for this I give to you my hearty thanks.

Regarding your question of the planetary systems, the planets are arranged in each universe in layers like the petals of a lotus. But in each layer there is mixed both heavenly, hellish and middle planets. On the outside layer there are these three kinds of planets, on the middle layers there are the three kinds of planets and on the inner-most layer there are found these three kinds of planets. Above these layers, in the center, is the Brahmaloka where Lord Brahma, the creator is residing. So the earth planet and the moon planet are both on the same layer but the earth is middle planet and the moon is heavenly planet.

I have sent to Jagadisa his beads duly initiated upon by me and I hope that he has received them by now. Please offer my blessings to Ernestine, Mr. Eric, Bhurijana and all others who are helping you at your center. I hope that you are all in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
