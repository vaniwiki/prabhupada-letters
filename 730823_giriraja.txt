====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

Bombay

My dear Giriraja

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter and the nice Vyasa Puja offering you have sent. I have sent it to Satsvarupa Goswami for printing in the BTG. Writing is a very important part of our work and satsvarupa is always anxious to have new material from the devotees for expanding the BTG. You have a nice talent for writing, practice makes perfect, so continue, it will be appreciated.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
