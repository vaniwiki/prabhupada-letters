Acyutananda. His address is as follows: 35 Satish Mukherjee Road, Calcutta-26, WB, India.

We are not arranging to print the __Krsna__ Book in our own press. It will contain about 48 color pictures. Sudama has written me from Japan that they have got very good opportunity in Tokyo for spreading the Sankirtana Movement, so they are moving from Kyoto to Tokyo city proper, and it is understood that some of the Japanese boys are already singing the Hare Krishna Mantra. I think I have written one letter to Sri Sai. Was it delivered to him? Now you are in good terms with the boy? Thank you once more for your letter. I hope this will meet you in good health by Krishna's Grace. I hope Govinda Dasi is also keeping good health now.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
