Dear Goursundar,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of February, and noted the contents.

Why not come see me during the Mayapur festival? It begins 27 February until 8 March.

You are already trained, so you can develop a nice center. Krsna will help. Your devotional service will never be lost. Be sincere and pray to Krsna that you remain in standard Krsna Consciousness. And wherever you remain follow the principles and your success of life is assured.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
