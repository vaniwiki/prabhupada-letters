My dear Krsna Vilasini dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1976.

As long as the body will be there, there will only be pain. Pleasure is only a misconception. Do not be sorry if you are in an "unfortunate" situation. It can also be fortunate if you take advantage by becoming serious to become Krsna consciousness. Follow the regulative principles, chant 16 rounds and as far as possible render service and study my books. Success is sure.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
