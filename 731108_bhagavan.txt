My dear Bhagavan Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that I have received a very nice report from Hansadutta of the Moscow activities, and I may request you in this regard to please immediately send Mandakini there for being married to Ananta Santi Das. Both of them will get good strength from it. So please do the needful.

I have not received any report from you of Paris affairs since coming to India, so please send me the report.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
