====== Letter to: Brsni ======

Kamuela, Hawaii

My dear Brsni Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 8, 1975. The Deities may be carved without hair or dhoties, and then later they can be dressed.

I will be anxious to see the photographs of your work.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
