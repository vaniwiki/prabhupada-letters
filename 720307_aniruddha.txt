====== Letter to: Aniruddha ======

Dallas

My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 31, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I am very glad to learn that you are enthusiastic to teach the children. Most of your questions I have answered as above to Satsvarupa. Simply follow the program of the elders, let the children associate as much as possible with the routine KC program, and when the others go out for working and business matters, the children can be given classes as you describe. They can learn our method of Krishna Consciousness by rising early, cleansing, plus knowledge of Sanskrit, English, a little Mathematics, history, geography, that's all. We haven't got to take any help from the government by getting so-called accreditation. If outsiders want to send their children to us, it will not be for their accreditation, but because they will get the best education for relieving them of all anxieties of material life and for this education the government has no idea. Where is such thing as transmigration of the soul being taught in classroom? If they simply learn to rise early, cleanse, all hygienic principles, their study will be greater than any government program. Whatever the elder members are doing, the children should do if possible. But for teaching the teachers themselves should be fixed up initiated devotees, otherwise how the children can get the right information and example? Thank you very much for serving Krishna in this way, and if you go on sincerely serving like this, chanting, and following the regulative principles strictly, all your questions will be answered by Krishna automatically. Hope this finds you in good health,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
