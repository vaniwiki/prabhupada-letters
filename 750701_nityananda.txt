My dear Nityananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 28, 1975 with the enclosed photos. Your farm appears very nice, open plain land. The cows are very nice and so are the sheds. This farm project you should consider very important. The idea is that people can be self sufficient and raise their own foodstuffs and have sufficient milk to save time and chant Hare Krishna. Why should they work so hard in the hellish factories? Let everyone live simply and be Krsna conscious.

Upon your recommendation I accept Paul Warren Menard as my initiated disciple. His spiritual name is Pana dasa. Please see that he maintains the Vaisnava standards and chants always 16 rounds minimum.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
