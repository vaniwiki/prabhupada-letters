====== Letter to: Haimavati ======

Krishna Balaram Temple\\
Raman Reti, Vrindaban

Sree Dham Mayapur\\
Dist. Nadia, West Bengal

Dear Haimavati devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of February 14, 1977, and examined the contents.

You report that Bhagaji is tired of dealing with the politics of ISKCON. Of course as soon as there are a number of men dealing, there are politics, but we still have to execute our duty. Anyway, I shall be coming there to Vrindaban and we shall talk.

As for yourself, after hearing your problems there and your difficulties living with Bhagaji etc., I suggest you come and live in Mayapur for some days. There are extensive residential quarters here. Why don't you come to Mayapur?

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
