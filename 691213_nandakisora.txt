My dear Nandakisora,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter and have noted the contents with pleasure. You are gradually developing to be a nice Vaisnava, and please continue in this way. Krishna will be very pleased upon you. Regarding the song by Srila Bhaktivinode Thakura, the transliteration is as follows:

> manasa deha geha yo kichu mora
> arpilun tua pade nandakisora

> maravi rakhavi yo iccha tohara
> nitya dasa prati tua adhikara

The translation is "My mind, my body, my home, or whatever I have got in my possession I surrender unto Your Lotus Feet, O my dear Lord, Son of Nanda Maharaja (Krishna). Now if you like, you can kill me, or if you like, you can give me protection. Whatever you like you can do. I am your eternal servitor. You have got every right to deal with me in any way as you please."

As I have informed Satsvarupa, I shall be arriving in Boston on December 21st at 3:40 pm. So I shall be very pleased to see you again at that time. Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Jahnava, and the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
