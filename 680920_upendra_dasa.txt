**Translation**

Dear Sir,

I the undersigned Mr. George E. Taylor professor of oriental languages after offering obeisances to the lotus feet of Guru beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letter which I received a few days ago. I beg your pardon because I am delayed in replying your letter on account of my being engaged in some other business. I hope all success to Bhaktivedanta swami for his great endeavour in preaching religious activities which I come to learn by your kindness. In your letter you have asked for some time to see us but there is no such opportunity to meet you. The authorities of the Washington University does not encourage anyone's religious activities and it is well known that there is specific stricture.

yours faithfully

George E. Taylor - Director

Dear Mr. Taylor,

While thanking you for your letter dated 20th September, 1968 I beg to inform you that our spiritual master Om Viṣnupāda Bhaktivedānta Svāmi Mahārāja is not preaching a type of faith which you have described as __yasya kasyapi dharmasya protsāhanaṁ__. He is preaching __svarupa dharma__. He is preaching the __svarupa dharma__ of all living entities. As a great Sanskṛt scholar you must have come across the following famous Sanskṛt passages like __sa vai pumsām paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhoksaje, dharman tu sākṣāt bhagavat praṇitaṁ dharmena hīna pasubhiḥ samānāḥ__ [[books:sb:1:2:6|(SB 1.2.6)]]. We practice and preach __svabhāva dharma__ but not that __dharma__ which is taken as a matter of faith. The __svabhāva dharma__ of every living creature is to become a servant. Even a great scholar like yourself is also a servant of __Washingtondesiya rajya__. Similarly everyone is servant of somebody superior. This servitorship is constitutional position of all living beings. But in conditional state everyone is serving his senses. This is called __virupa dharma__. The __svarupa dharma__ is to serve the master of the senses namely __hṛṣikesha__. This __hṛṣikesha__ servitorship is liberation of the conditioned soul. Without this, __namely hṛṣikena hṛṣikesha sevanam bhaktir ucyate__. __Harāv ābhaktasya kuto mahat gunāḥ manorathena asato dhāvato vahiḥ__, a man is __pasubhisamānāh__. According to Asian sanskṛt scholars __vidya bhāgavatabadhi__. I wish therefore to request you to introduce in your department of Asian language and literature the study of Srimad Bhāgavatam, the summit of Sanskṛt literature as accepted by great Sanskṛt scholars like Sridharsvami, Virraghavacharya, Jiva Gosvami, Visvanāth Chakravarty and above all Lord Chaitanya who was known as __Nimāi Pandit__ the greatest sanskrit scholar in the 15th century. As you are teacher in a great __visvavidyalaya__ you may introduce the study of Srimad Bhagavatam in your department because it is said in the Bhāgavatam __koumāra acaret prājno dharmān bhāgavatāniha dūrlabham mānusam janma tadapyadhruvamarthadam__. I am sorry I cannot reply in Sanskṛt because our process of study is not academic but by __sruti__.

yours sincerely,
