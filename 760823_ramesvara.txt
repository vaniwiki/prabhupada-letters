My dear Ramesvara Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the BBT Trustees report and have heard your proposal for funding the Mayapur project. Yes your proposal sounds very nice and you may do it. It is very good that this project be a world-wide effort.

Gurukrpa Maharaja has taken charge of the collecting for Mayapur now. You can simply send his food relief collection money to Mayapur. When the Bombay project is finished and Mayapur begins, the Mayapur project should be financed in the same way.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
