My Dear Kirtanananda, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated September 1st and 6th, 1969, and I have also received the Bhaktishastri examinations from New Vrindaban along with the contribution for our book fund. Hayagriva is here with me in England, and things are progressing nicely so far as Krishna Consciousness propagation is concerned. When I arrived here on the 11th September, there were m ore than one dozen reporters there to take pictures of the reception. The next day there were several articles published in the local papers, and I am enclosing one such article for your reference. I am very pleased to learn that you are going to Ohio to preach after Janmastami Day, and I shall be glad to know of your experience in this connection. This evening there is scheduled a program of chanting and kirtan at the Town Hall, and there are similarly many other big engagements for us here. Most probably I shall be returning to the USA by November.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
