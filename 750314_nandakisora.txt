My dear Nandakisora dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 14th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I think it is best if you consult with Prajapati prabhu on these points. He is in charge of the dramas, so take his advice on these matters. Keep yourself always engaged in Krishna's service following very strictly the rules and regulations so that Maya will not be able to discourage you in your attempt to become Krishna Conscious.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
