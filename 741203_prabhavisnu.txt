My dear Prabhavisnu das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 9, 1974. I am very glad to learn that you are all working peacefully together. This is the most favorable atmosphere for cultivating our Krishna consciousness. And if people see us working together nicely, they cannot criticize anything against our Krishna consciousness movement.

Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following devotees as my initiated disciples and their names are as follows: 1. Soley---Sarvasagara dasa; 2. Angela---Aksunnasakti devi dasi; 3. Jackie---Janardanaprita devi dasi. Their beads may be chanted upon by Hansadutta. I am also accepting the following as twice born brahmanas upon your recommendation: Brsabha dasa; Jaya Laksmana das; Jnana das; and Jalastitha devi das. Their mantra sheets and sanctified threads are duly enclosed. Now hold a fire sacrifice. The gayatri mantra can be heard through the right ear from my recorded tape.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
