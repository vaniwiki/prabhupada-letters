====== Letter to: Jagadisa ======

Toronto

My dear Jagadisa

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10th November, 1970 and I've noted the contents carefully. I've received a GBC report of the Pittsburgh meeting and it is very nice. Please go on working cooperatively in this way and always keep in touch with the other GBC members. Such communication will give you spiritual strength to make the right decisions for pushing this Sankirtana movement.

So far as Canadian expansion is concerned, your suggestion to open centers in Ottawa, Hamilton, Quebec and Winipeg is very nice, so do it practically and Krishna will be pleased by your sincere efforts. Performing Kirtana and conducting classes at universities along with distribution in the libraries and the colleges of our literature is a very important program, so do it enthusiastically. There are innumerable departments of knowledge being presented in the universities, but there is no department of knowledge for understanding the science of God, Krishna and therefore we want to introduce such a department of knowledge.

Yes, Krishna Consciousness is simple. Chant, dance, take prasadam and always try to think of Krishna. In the Bhagavad-gita it is stated by Krishna that whatever you do, eat, give away in charity or sacrifice should be done as an offering to Him, and by this principle of work, surely you will come to Him. So everyone has to eat and work. Simply we should do so on Krishna's account and that will make our life perfect.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
