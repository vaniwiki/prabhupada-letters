My dear Gargamuni Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the photos of Vrindaban as well as your telegram reading as follows: WORK STOPPED ON KITCHEN DOLLARS EIGHT THOUSAND NEVER RECEIVED PLEASE ADVISE\\
---GARGAMUNI.

So what I can do? Brahmananda Maharaja informs me that Jayatirtha told him on the telephone that the money was sent. So you have to check with the bank why it is not yet received. But why the work should be stopped?

I understand you are considering a property on Camac Street opposite Central Bank of India and the price is Rs. 20 lakhs. So whether the property is worth Rs. 20 lakhs? Is there sufficient land to build a nice temple there? I do not think so. Anyway, we will not move out of our present place. You are paying rent only Rs. 1100/- monthly. Our men can continue to live there, and we can construct a nice temple on this other property. What is the area?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
