My dear Brahmananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your Janmastami 1976 invitation sheet, but there is no mention of the Vyasa Puja ceremony. Generally in our centers they issue Janmastami invitations along with Vyasa Puja invitations.

I have read your Vyasa Puja offering, so it will be a great pleasure to know whether Vyasa Puja was officially held in Nairobi. I am always anxious to know about Nairobi affairs. If you kindly send a report at least once a month, that will be appreciated.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
