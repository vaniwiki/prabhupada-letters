====== Letter to: Giriraja ======

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 22, 1972, regarding the supply of deity for Chicago centre. I am told that the Bharatapur deity is more than 200 years old and is made of solid silver, and therefore it will be very difficult to get government permission to export it from India. It will be too much trouble, so if nice deities can be gotten from Jaipur as we have done before, that is better.

Now first business is to get the permission of Charity Commissioner. One MP from Assam has forwarded his letter to Chief Minister Naik urging him to help us get that permission. If we cannot settle, then get the Charity Permission and sue in the court. Our position is strong. We can sue even without Charity Commission permission.

You and Tamala Krishna arrange the pandal programme in Bombay to be the first-class presentation, and inform me of the dates. I think Tamala told me once from December 20 to January 10th. From Bombay I shall go to Calcutta, and after the 20th January I have been invited by Madhudvisa to go to Australia for about one month or six weeks, and then I shall return to Mayapur. Before coming to Bombay, I may go to Ahmedabad for some time, as Dinanatha has gone there to arrange the programme.

So long the regulative principles are followed, everything else will follow, and at least we shall command the respect of the public. People may not have the impression that they are the same hippies under different dress.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
