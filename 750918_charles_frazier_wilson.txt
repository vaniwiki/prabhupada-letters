My dear Charles Frazier Wilson,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 17, 1975, redirected to me here in Vrndavana, and I am glad to see that you have appreciated my books and the Krsna consciousness philosophy. So I recommend you to continue and read as much as possible and also chant Hare Krsna. We have our temple in Houston, Texas, and if possible you can associate with the devotees there for some time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
