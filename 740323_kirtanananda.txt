New Vrindaban

Dear Kirtanananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received from you the name of one devotee recommended for second initiation, namely Anadih das Brahmacari. So I am enclosing sacred thread and gayatri mantra. Have him hear the tape of me chanting the mantra through his right ear. Give him all good instruction and incorporate him into the New Vrindaban scheme according to his best service propensities. I will be glad to be receiving your regular report on New Vrindaban which you can mail to me at the Bombay address.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
