My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. I have gladly accepted for first initiation those devotees recommended by you and their spiritual names are as follows.

Tom Guild---Tatvavit dasa

Art Yri---Acyuta dasa

Debbie Yarber---Dhanistha devi

Leaf---Lila smaranam devi

Bala---Bala dasa

Now be sure these devotees know and vow to follow the four rules and that they are chanting at least 16 rounds daily. Initiation does not mean they have completed all spiritual perfection and now they can relax but it means now they have begun spiritual life. If they are true to their vows they will %%_%% all perfection in this life and be eligible to go back to home back to Godhead.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

PS. I have also accepted Charles and Alice French for first initiation and Sriman Brikasanga das Raksana das, Srimate Havirdani dasi and Kamatavi dasi for second initiation.

Now go on following all the regulative principles and enthusiastically engage yourselves twenty-four hours in the service of Sri Sri Radha and KRSNA. Alice's spiritual name is Atma-maya dasi and Charlie's is Tapan Misra das.
