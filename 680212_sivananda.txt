My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 8, 1968. You want to counteract the activities of Maharishi, but you must know Maharishi is the agent of Maya. Our process of Krishna Consciousness and Sankirtana movement is already counteracting the spell of Maya, but the Maharishi says that you remain under the spell of Maya. His preaching is that you enjoy, and simply you pay him $35, and purchase his mantra. People in general are already under the spell of Maya. That is to say, they want sense gratification. If anyone encourages the method of sense gratification, at the same time become a yogi, why people will not prefer that method? We say there is no illicit sexlife, no intoxication, no meat eating, no gambling, so if Maharishi says there is no restrictions, naturally large number of people will follow him. That means they want to be cheated, and Krishna sends them a cheater. We cannot cheat people like him. We must say the truth, as they are prescribed; in the Bhagavad-gita there are 18 kinds of austerities, 13rd chapter. The restrictions which we are following are austerities. Without austerity, without celibacy, any amount of nonsense meditation will not help. So there is no comparison of our method with Maharishi's method. We are not out to counteract any kind of vandalism. We must present the genuine thing before the public, and if they are intelligent enough they will take it up and realize it. The followers of Maharishi are not intelligent class of men. If you have any advancement in the knowledge of Bhagavad-gita, you can test any follower of Maharishi, you will find he is nil.

The idea for Japan is very nice, but who will bear the expenses, that is the problem. And who will take charge of the pavilion, that is the problem. If you can manage to construct such pavilion, I have no objection. But consult with Janardana and others in this connection. Your good wish is very nice, and I can also go there, but it requires thousands of dollars to give effect to such proposal.

If you can do so, you can join Acyutananda immediately, as you like. If you are able, you can go. You can correspond with Acyutananda, his address is as follows: Acyutananda das Brahmacari, c/o Mr. N. Banerjea; 114 Elliot Road; Kanpur, 4; India.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
