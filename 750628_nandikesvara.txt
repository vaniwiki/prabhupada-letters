My dear Nandikesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 17, 1975 and thank you for the nice report. You are enthusiastic for spreading Krsna consciousness. This is the most important quality. Please continue.

I am accepting the following as twice born brahmanas and their threads duly sanctified are enclosed: Duryodhana guru dasa and his wife Vrndadevi dasi, and hold a fire sacrifice and impress upon them that they are taking vows before Radha Krsna, the spiritual master, and the assembled Vaisnavas.

I also accept the following as my initiated disciple: Dandra Fohr---Sanga devi dasi. Please see that she carefully follows the regulative principles.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
