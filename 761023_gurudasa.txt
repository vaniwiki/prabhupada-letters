My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12/10/76.

I never said that you should go undercover for preaching in Eastern Europe. Everything should be done openly and very carefully. Krsna will protect your efforts.

Up to date the Vrindaban guest house is a failure. Nobody's coming. You are always welcome in Vrindaban, but I think you can come for the Mayapur festival. Right now, Harikesa and Sucandra are very eager to preach. So, you should find out where they are and make arrangements to assist them.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
