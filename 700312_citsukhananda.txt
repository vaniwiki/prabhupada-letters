My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10 March, 1970, along with the check for $50, and thank you very much for the same. I am pleased to see the newspaper clipping from San Jose State College newspaper, and learn that the students are already attending your Bhagavad-gita class at the Experimental College.

I am also very much pleased to have your report of progressing the public interest in Krsna Consciousness. The secret of success will depend on yourself keeping on the spiritual strength by regularly chanting and following the regulative principles, and side by side you have to act on preaching the gospel, and it will go on without any impediment.

I was so pleased to learn that the police officer was afraid of being converted and therefore he asked you to go, but with full support for your Sankirtana activities. It is very nice.

I am sorry to learn that Candrabali is not there, and she is living with her uncle. Do not be worried, she will come back; and if you give me her address, I shall write to her.

Krishna will give you timely a suitable place, don't worry about it. Our leader, Sanatana Goswami, was living underneath a tree, and He was keeping His Deity, Krishna, hanging on the branch of the tree, wrapped up in a cloth---and still He was always engaged in the service of the Lord. So place or no place, we must go on with our preaching work. Please keep me informed about your progress, and offer my blessings to all the boys.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
