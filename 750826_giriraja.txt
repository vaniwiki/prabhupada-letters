My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22/8/75 and your telegram reading as follows: COMMISSIONER AGREES WRITTEN IOD TEMPLE WITHIN 24 HOURS---GIRIRAJA DASA. So this is very good news. Actually Krishna is doing everything. Only we are taking the credit.

I am enclosing a copy of the latest "Back to Godhead", and I am requesting that in your Janmastami Festival meeting you read the article under "ISKCON NEWS" about the Ratha Yatra Festival. The point is that in the foreign countries they are accepting this a bona fide religion and making holidays and our Ratha Yatra is regularly established. But, in our own country they are giving so many hindrances. Anyway, after all we have got the permission. I am also sending you a copy of the corrspondence with Raj Kapoor. This should also be discussed in your meeting how prominent people are giving us respect, why are others making false propaganda? This correspondence can be published by you along with his photograph. I think you have one publication of Member Lists. It can go in there.

I am returning herewith the Bank of America resolutions duly signed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
