My Dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am so glad to receive your letter dated October 20, 1969. Now I am very much hopeful that New Vrindaban will develop very nicely under your good care. You had a very successful meeting in the University, and that is wanted. As soon as you get some opportunity you should immediately go out with Hayagriva's car and preach. Krishna will bless you more and more. Now you have got a good assistant, Yamunacharya das Brahmachary. I have sent his beads through Hayagriva. Hayagriva and Shama Dasi will be constantly engaged in editorial work, so you take care of the boys and cows in New Vrindaban along with Ranadhir. All our centers are doing very nicely, and now your center, New Vrindaban, is also doing very nicely. The more we preach the Glories to Krishna, the more He will be pleased and there will be no scarcity. So follow these principles and keep me informed of your preaching success.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
