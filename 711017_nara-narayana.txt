My dear Nara Narayana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 11th October, 1971 and have noted the contents. First of all you finish the model work nicely. I am going to Bombay on the 20th, starting from Nairobi on the 19th night reaching 8:15 the next morning. I shall start for Calcutta on the 24th instant and the expected time of arrival will be cabled from Bombay.* I am very glad that you are already working on the model. Finish it nicely and when I go to Calcutta on the 24th we shall take up the matter of engineering work, consulting with others.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
