My dear Acyutananda and Kirtanananda Maharajas,

Please accept my blessings. I have not heard from either of you since my coming this side to Bombay, so I am very anxious to know how you are each making life members.

I wrote one letter to P. M. Thakura to be delivered by one of our men personally. Whether it has been delivered? Where is the big key for Vrindaban? Devananda Maharaja has taken the smaller key from your box, but he did not find the large key.\\
I have written one letter to Mr. Jaju, and he has just replied briefly. Please see him and whether he is really serious?

Please keep me informed how things are going on in Calcutta.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
