My dear Madhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice and encouraging letter dated 18th May, along with your gift a check for $150 in appreciation for your initiation, and thank you you so very much for this.

I am very glad to learn that things are going on very well in Boston. Boston is one of our major centers for the large missionary work of Krsna consciousness movement, so there is always an abundance of Krsna conscious activities going on. It is very good that you are finding this atmosphere of avid service to the Lord to be so congenial. It is the sign of advancement in Krsna consciousness that the devotee does not care for any nice varieties of material engagements based on sense gratification but he finds increasing pleasure in those places where the service of the Lord is being carried out with enthusiasm.

So you take the good opportunity to study well our literatures and how to apply the philosophy of Krsna consciousness practically in daily working and help us to spread this transcendental message to all the people of the world. That is our desire. So your humble and sincere effort is needed to be applied for executing this program to the best of your capacity.

My Guru Maharaja used to say that everything is already supplied by Krsna; all the ingredients of different varieties already are there; there is no lack of anything in this world. The only thing that is lacking is Krsna consciousness. So Krsna is supplying us with all facilities, so there is no question of scarcity of anything. Simply we must become Krsna conscious and conscientiously apply our energy to utilizing all facilities in the matter of pleasing Krsna or devotional service. We should always be very careful to avoid utilizing any of the facilities available for our own sense gratification, but we should use everything for the satisfaction of Krsna only.

Thanking you once again.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
