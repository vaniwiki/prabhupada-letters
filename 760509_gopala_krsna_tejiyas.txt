My dear Gopala Krishna and Tejyas das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received very encouraging reports from the Library Party in India, and it appears that this program will increase more and more. Now, you must be very sure to keep a stock of each and every book so that you can supply all of these orders immediately. You may require a stock of some 300 of each and every volume. So, contact Ramesvara Maharaja and compare your stocks with what you may require in the near future. The point is that you must have these books in stock in order to supply the orders promptly.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
