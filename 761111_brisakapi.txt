Dear Brisakapi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated November 1, 1976.

This matter must be decided by the GBC. Let them consult together and decide. Whatever they decide is approved by me.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
