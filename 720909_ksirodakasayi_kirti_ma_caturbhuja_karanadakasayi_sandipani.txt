Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kindly remembering me on Vyasa Puja birthday, and I have appreciated your warm sentiments with great satisfaction. I am very much encouraged by your progress in Krishna Consciousness. Now go on in this way always striving to please Krsna and you will feel yourself becoming happy more and more. That I want.
