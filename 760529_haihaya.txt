My dear Haihaya das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 21, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

The daily collections from the temple should be counted before 3 persons together. The accountant has nothing to do with these things. He simply notes down the figure in the books. This is how it should be done. Yes, the collections will increase as people come more and more. The temple should become self-sufficient, that is wanted. However, see that stealing is stopped. I am doubtful that things are being stolen, otherwise how is the expenditure so high.

In addition to the picture exhibition in the guests' reception room, you can also have the appreciations for our books exhibited, as was done during the previous Mayapur festival. Fill up the guesthouse with visitors. That is very important.

This business of sleeping devotees should stop. What is the use of such sleeping devotees, simply increasing the expenditures. All of them must be engaged. Women and child should all move to the new Taparia house, and the mukhut business should remain in the Guesthouse for now. Gurukula can also be held daily at the Taparia house, and when the Gurukula is completed, grhasthas may occupy some of the third floor facilities of the Gurukula. But, everyone must be actively engaged.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
