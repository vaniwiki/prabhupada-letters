My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated June 7, 1969 and June 11, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the tour of North Dakota, this is a nice proposal. So if it is practical, it will be very nice for you and your wife. Only thing you have to do is rent a station wagon, so you can travel, sleep and cook there. Keep with you four or five pairs of cymbals, one harmonium, one mrdanga. One of you play the harmonium, one of you plays the mrdanga, and some persons in the audience can play the karatalas. In this way you can perform nice kirtana. Subala met me here in New Vrindaban and described this plan, but I do not think it is mature yet. But when some arrangement is done, you can accept it. You have suggested that Nandakisora and his wife join you, but how will you manage with two pairs of husbands wives with the $350 per week? The program is very nice, and if you can make it practical, I have full support for it. This is a good opportunity for spreading our philosophy and Sankirtana. I understand that you and Himavati have gone already to Vancouver, and I am expecting a letter from you as to your report in this connection.

Please offer my blessings to Himavati. I hope this will meet you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

PS: Regarding the time when the devotees arise in the morning, here in New Vindavan they are getting up by four o'clock. But in your country the people are not accustomed to this, and it will take a little time to get them used to it. But try to get them up at four o'clock as far as possible.
