====== Letter to: Kirtiraja ======

Los Angeles

My dear Kirtiraja dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 26, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for sending the book reviews. They are very encouraging to me. As much as possible, we want our books to be accepted by all learned circles of men. Regarding sending books freely to any library. The system that you can adopt is to send the books and tell them to read them over for one week's time. If they do not like the book, they should send it back at our cost. If they like it and want it, then they can send the amount of money to us (whatever the book sells for). But, we cannot give books away free to anyone. They must be paid for.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
