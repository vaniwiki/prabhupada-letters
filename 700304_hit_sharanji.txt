====== Letter to: Hit Sharanji ======

Scindia House\\
New Delhi, India

My dear Hit Sharanji,

Please accept my blessings. I hope you have received my letter dated 28 February, 1970.

In the meantime, I have received a reply from Srimati Sumati Morarji in which I understand that she has already replied to your letter regarding the dispatch of the Murtis.

Now, through the forwarding agents, Messrs. Cox and Kings, you can arrange to ship all the Murtis through Scindia Steam Navigation Co. to different places as already directed.

I shall be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience. Thanking you in anticipation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
