My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 21, 1969 sent Special Delivery, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased to learn that you are situated nicely in Columbus and now Indira Dasi has agreed to become your wife. This is very nice, and I don't think there is any need of worrying about her mother's request that she continues to go to school. She is old enough now, and if she wishes to come to Columbus as your wife, then this is her decision, and I do not see that the mother should object to this. So you may inform her in this way. When this is settled up I shall inform you as to where and when the marriage ceremony is to be performed.

Please convey my blessings to the other devotees there. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
