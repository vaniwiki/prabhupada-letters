Dear Sirs:

With reference to our meeting on March 20, 1976 at Haridaspore, I beg to propose that immediately we require at least Rs. 50,000/- for development of the place. Kindly let me know exactly what is the area of the land (include a sketch of the land), and then we can make a site plan and a building construction plan.

I heard from Prabhu Swarup Das that one gentleman has already promised Rs. 10,000/- so another Rs. 10,000/- can also be given by us. The other Rs. 30,000/- can be collected by your endeavour and the thing can be started immediately. I wish that before the next rainy season we can begin work.

I hope that this meets you in good health,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
