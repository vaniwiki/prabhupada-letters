====== Letter to: Patita Uddharana (was Patita Pavana) ======

My dear Patita Pavana, now, Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter, and thank you very much for it. That you are chanting and reading with great delight is very good. Please continue this practice and the delight will continue to increase the more you increase sincerity. I understand also that your family is now reading Back To Godhead, and this is also very good. Just try to explain this philosophy to them, and convince them in this way.

I understand that there is also a devotee in N.Y. with similar name, so I am hereby changing your name to Patita Uddharana. The meaning is practically the same. Patita means fallen, and Pavana means deliverer of, and Uddha means to lift up. So Patita Uddharana means One who lifts up the fallen souls, or Deliverer of the fallen souls.

I hope you are all well, and just continue and try to make the temple there very successful. There are many young people searching after the real path of spiritual realization, and you simply have to make it readily available to them.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
