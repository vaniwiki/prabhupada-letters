My dear Gurukrpa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. During discussions with Jayapataka and Gargamuni Maharaja's regarding the construction of the present new guest house in Mayapur, they informed me that 9,70,000.00 rupees are required to finish the project.

I desire that this project be completed as soon as possible. They inform me that the construction can be completed in five months if funds are provided adequately. Therefore you may transfer the above mentioned amount to ISKCON's Mayapur Development Fund in Calcutta, and advise me of the transfer.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

nb---If you have already done business with their bank in Calcutta, then you can send the funds directly, otherwise, if you do not know the details of their account, then you can transfer the funds to my account at the American Express International Banking Corp. Calcutta, in my name, account no. 5416.\\
