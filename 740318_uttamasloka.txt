Dear Uttama Sloka,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted for first initiation the devotees recommended by you, and their spiritual names are as follows:

Rick Richert---Revati-prana-natha dasa

Kevin Douglas---Kesisatru dasa\\
Be sure to instruct them on the ten offenses and their obligation to chant at least 16 rounds daily, without fail. You may send their beads to Rupanuga Maharaja for chanting, and you may hold a fire yajna in the temple.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
