====== Letter to: Radha-sarana ======

My dear Radha-sarana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter to my secretary dated October 2, 1976.

According to your recommendation I am accepting for second initiation Amala-harinama das Brahmacari and Viraja dasi. Now hold a fire ceremony for attendance of devotees only. You must be sure that these devotees are very strictly following the regulative principles and chanting a minimum of sixteen rounds daily. They must be fully engaged in devotional service, 24 hours per day. Please find enclosed two gayatri mantra sheets and one sacred thread. After the fire sacrifice, play the tape of me reciting the gayatri mantra into the right ear of these initiates and show them how to count on their fingers.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
