My dear Candanacarya:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 22, 1973 and have noted the contents. Yes, the name of your daughter Radhasakti is all right. I am glad to learn that you are again with the printing department. So now you print small books as many as possible from my lectures past and present as New York has done, and if possible print big books, but I don't think that big books will be suitable for your press.

Yes, I am returning to Los Angeles after completing the Bombay affairs and a little tour of Africa and Australia, but by mid December I am sure to return to Los Angeles.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
