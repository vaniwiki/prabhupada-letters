My dear Guru das,

Please accept my blessings. Acyutananda and Ramanuja Brahmacaris are now at the following address. c/o N. Banerjee, 114 Elliot Road, Kanpur 4, India. They are contemplating to open a preaching center at Kanpur, and you can open correspondence with them before starting for India.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
