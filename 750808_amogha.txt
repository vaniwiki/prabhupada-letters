My dear Amogha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 15, 1975 and have noted the contents. I think you should take Australian rather than the American passport. The Australian passport is better because it is Commonwealth. So you take the Australian passport, and immediately go to India. We require good men in India now. Indonesia is not a very important place.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
