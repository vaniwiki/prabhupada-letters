My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. Now I understand that I may return with my visitors visa which can be altered once I am in USA. If MacMillan is silent then immediately send me the correspondence which Dvarakadhisa had with the Japanese printers. Most probably I shall stop in Tokyo & hand over the printing to them. Hope you are well.
