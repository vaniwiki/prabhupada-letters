My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 7/22/73. Everything you have arranged is in order. I have signed the cards. All cheques issued should be entered into the Account Book, and an informing letter should be written regarding: to whom the cheque was made and what purpose: and send one copy to me and one to Bali Mardan.

I am also happy to note that Hayagriva is working on The Books. Please keep him carefully, his work is very important for our Movement.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
