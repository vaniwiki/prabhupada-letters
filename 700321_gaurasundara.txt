My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 3 March, 1970, and have noted the contents.

Since you have requested me so often to go to Hawaii, I must go, there is no doubt. It only remains for you to let me know when is the best time for my coming there. Of course the mango season is best, so please inform me so I can make out my schedule, and you can make all arrangements.

Do you have the pictures of Prahlada which you painted some years ago? I think they may be published in BTG, but they have been missing.

Please offer my blessings to Govinda Dasi and to all the boys and girls there in New Navadvipa.

Hope this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
