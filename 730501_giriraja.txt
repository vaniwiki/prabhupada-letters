My dear Giriraja Das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two letters dated 25.4 and 26.4 and have noted the contents carefully. I have noted that you have said about there being new law that licensee is tenant or owner. I do not know what to do on this, but the fact is that we are the proprietor. In the contract it states that we must pay Rs. 2 lacs and within the first year then the conveyance must be given, the another Rs. 2 lacs the next year thereafter up to 14 lacs being paid. So the first 2 lacs they've already taken from us, so the transaction is completed. Tactfully they did not give us the conveyance. So now they have given neither conveyance or returned our money, but the deal is completed. So when they shall give the conveyance, then we shall pay the balance.

But, you all have cancelled our claim, that weakens our case. So, why not let the Rent Court settle up and determine the rent of the land, and we will pay the actual rent of the land. . So in all ways we are the occupiers---as licensee, tenant, or owner. So what we actually are, that should be settled up.

Regarding apartment, Kartikeya says that we can purchase in the name of Society. But, if individual name is required, then my name can be given as Founder-Acarya. If there is some complication, then don't purchase. Keep the money in the bank, and try your best to get Grand Paradi land. If nobody can purchase
