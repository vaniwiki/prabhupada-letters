My dear Gopala Krishna dasa,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find the power of attorney which you requested over the telephone from Tamala Krishna Maharaja. It has been duly notarized and registered (recorded) in the court (see the attached blue card), and on the reverse side of the blue card it has been verified by the Consulate General of India in New York. The second blank (unused) page is for use in recording this power of attorney in the court in India. I trust that you will have received this safely and that you will immediately inform me by post upon receipt of this letter.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Is the opening of the Hyderabad Centre going to take place as scheduled on August 18, 1976? Please inform me immediately of the program.\\
