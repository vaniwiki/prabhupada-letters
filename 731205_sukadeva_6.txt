My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 4, 1973. Thank you very much for increasing the book distribution in Seattle. My Guru Maharaja was most pleased to see books distributed so continue to increase it more and more.

Yes, your debating program is approved by me. If we study the Bhagavad-gita thoroughly we can defeat all philosophies.

Yes, I can come to Seattle. I am going to Mexico City and Chicago to return to Los Angeles around December 24th. So after that we shall consider coming there.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
