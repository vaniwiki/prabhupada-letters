Dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of December 24th, and studied the contents carefully. I have also noted the photocopy of the check for $1,000.00 and thank you very much.

Regarding the book distribution in your zone, there is no pressure, but still you can try to improve. You have temples located in excellent cities for distribution, so why not increase it?

I was very pleased to hear of the successful meeting with the parents in Washington D.C. Now gather opinions in writing from them. This opposition party is artificial. They have no standing. Make a little effort and they will be defeated. Sunday school for Indian children is very good, and you have knowledge how to educate. This should be done everywhere. If we give the Indian culture to their children they will be very appreciative.

Regarding your proposal for becoming a lawyer, you can do it. If a GBC man becomes a good lawyer that is very good; utilize this opportunity by working with the lawyer.

As for the deprogrammers in the Philadelphia area, let us take precaution; let the GBC decide how to handle it. Let the deprogrammers do their best and we will do ours, and everything depends on Krsna. If we simply remain sincere devotees, then "all glories to the Pandavas, on whose side Krsna is fighting." For Krsna was on Arjuna's side, otherwise Arjuna was like a fig compared to the generals on the other side. Arjuna said it was like crossing a sea of crocodiles. If someone says Krsna helped Arjuna but that was long ago, we say that Krsna is here now, the devotees are here now, and the business is the same. It has nothing to do with material time.

If Montreal has such difficulty getting French books from Bhagavan in France, then why not open a BBT branch in L.A.? This can be settled by the GBC in Mayapur.

As for Balavanta becoming a lawyer, it is not that we are concerned for many devotees to become lawyers. We can pay for a lawyer; rather we need strong workers. If you can become a lawyer it will be helpful, but not that many devotees have to become. But I can understand that Balavanta's becoming a lawyer is a trick to help his preaching for associating with important people in the government. Therefore it is all right. In this case we apply the principle, anukulasya sankalpam pratikulya vivarjanam (C.C. Madhya 22.97) "Whatever is favorable for Krsna should be done."

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
