Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Vasudeva,

Please accept my blessings. Today I have received a report from Ramesvara Maharaja describing the Grand Opening ceremony of the Sri Krsna-Kaliya Temple at Fiji. I am so much pleased that this occasion has been celebrated so successfully. I pray that Kaliya-Krsna bless you with all intelligence and strength for pushing this great movement of Krsna consciousness forward to all the people of your country. You have worked so sincerely and now Krsna has personally appeared.

In his letter Ramesvara has written, "Our plan is to continue expanding book distribution and try to get literally thousands of Hindus to begin chanting japa. In short, my report is that Fiji could easily become the first country in the world to have a Krsna conscious government, and Vasudeva is the perfect devotee to help accomplish this task." May Ramesvara Maharaja's words come true. By your example teach all of the citizens to become ideal Vaisnavas, faithfully following the regulative principles and chanting regularly the Hare Krsna mantra. Worship the Deity very gorgeously with full attention to regularity and cleanliness. Distribute ample quantities of sumptuous prasadam to everyone who visits Kaliya-Krsna. This program will make us successful. And in the morning and evening hold regular Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita discourses, but do not allow any rascal professional receiters to discourse in our temple. Only initiated disciples should be allowed to speak on the subject matter of Krsna consciousness.

Now I have come to the West in a broken condition of health. In such condition no one would think of touring. An ordinary man would prepare for death. But I am not afraid of death, so why not let me see once again all of my beloved disciples and the Temples all over the world. When I go to Hawaii this winter I shall be very much eager to come to Fiji and to see you at that time. Until then go on very enthusiastically and try to make all of the citizens Krsna conscious.

Hoping this meets you and all of your family members in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
