My dear Dina Bandhu das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 6th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for the 300 dollars daksina. Thank you again and again for distributing my books with great enthusiasm. Now, try to double this enthusiasm. Anyone who even touches one of our books gets such great benefit. Give them to everyone. Because you are all very sincere and working very hard, Krishna is giving you all facilities.

I have accepted upon your recommendation the three persons for 1st initiation and their names are as follows: Dave---Devarsi, Michele---Maladhari, Andrea---Abhaya. Their beads will be sent to you by separate post. I have also accepted Anantatma dasa for 2nd initiation. His thread and mantra sheet are enclosed herein. Let him hear the tape of myself chanting the gayatri mantra. It should be heard through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
