St. Louis

My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24th August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. Your program of travelling in a van from town to town and distributing our books and literatures and having street Sankirtana sounds very encouraging, so you can go ahead and do it with my full approval. So if the management of St. Louis temple will be maintained nicely then you can go ahead. The small Deity of Caitanya Mahaprabhu can go with you on tour. That will be nice. This touring program, going from town to town with Sankirtana party and distributing our literatures is our real program. So do it enthusiastically and with determination and surely Caitanya Mahaprabhu will bless you more and more.

Please offer my blessings to your wife Indira and son Jagannatha. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
