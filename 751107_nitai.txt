Vrindaban

My dear Nitai das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 28, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the matter with Purusottama dasa, you immediately go and take back whatever books of ours that he has in his possession. You may inform him that we do not require his editing, neither should he correspond with our men in Los Angeles. He is a very heinous man. He wants to become more important. Who sent him books from Los Angeles without asking me? Who has given him the books he now has? You take them back immediately. If this man comes to see me in Vrindaban, I do not wish to see him.

Regarding your enrolling in the Sanskrit school, if you get a certificate and you can get the extended student visa, then it is all right, but first of all get it.

It is not at all good that the Deities do not have warm clothing for the cold weather. They are still spending so much for construction, spending spending, but the Deities are not clothed properly. What is this?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
