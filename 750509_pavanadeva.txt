My dear Pavanadeva dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21st of April, 1975 and have noted the contents. Do not be discouraged. Simply follow all of the rules and regulations very carefully. Rise early, attend mangala arati, attend class, chant 16 rounds and follow the four basic rules and regulations. This is most important. Without these things, there is no spiritual life. If your try sincerely, then Krishna will give you all blessings.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
