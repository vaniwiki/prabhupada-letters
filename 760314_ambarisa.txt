My dear Ambarisa das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 8, 1976 and I have noted the contents carefully.

I am glad to hear of your program. Try to satisfy your parents also. Your parents desire that you become educated also, although they do now know that someone who is a devotee is best educated.

I have sent one letter to Srutakirti das in Hawaii. He has been managing the restaurant very nicely in Honolulu and now he can come to assist you in opening another prasadam restaurant there in Boston. I am enclosing a copy of the letter which I have sent to him.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
