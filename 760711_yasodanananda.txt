Hyderabad

My dear Yasodananandan Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 8, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

It is a good idea to use the money which had been collected in Madras to complete the Hyderabad Temple. The immediate necessity must be met first.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
