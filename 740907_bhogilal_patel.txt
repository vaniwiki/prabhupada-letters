My dear Bhogilal Patel:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter forwarded by Giriraja as well as your telegram dated September 6, 1974 regarding the Haridwar bungalow. I thank you very much for it, and when I am fit, I will take advantage of it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
