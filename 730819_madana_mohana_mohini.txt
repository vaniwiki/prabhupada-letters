My dear Modan Mohan Mohini,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 13, 1973. I thank you very much for your kind sentiments. To be a fool before the Spiritual Master is a very good qualification. It is not a good qualification to be over intelligent before the Spiritual Master. Even Lord Caitanya presented himself as a fool before his spiritual master.

Hansadutta is GBC for your zone and if you have any questions you may inquire from him.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
