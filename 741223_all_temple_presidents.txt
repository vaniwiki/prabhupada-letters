To: All Temple Presidents:

Please accept my blessings.

This is to introduce our life member, Sri Narinder Natha Bagai. Please try to help Mr. Bagai in every respect during his visit to your Temple, and provide him with boarding and lodging free of charge.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
