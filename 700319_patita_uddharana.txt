====== Letter to: Patita Uddharana ======

Boston

My dear Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for the six volumes of our BTG magazines which you have bound up and sent to me. You have done it very nicely, and I am keeping them installed in my bookshelf for convenient reference.

I do not think it is necessary to make any slip-cases as you have kindly offered. But in future, the magazines may be bound up by the full year and you may enclose in the binding also an index for the year's articles. Soon our BTG will also be printed in other languages, and it will be nice if you can also bind these in similar sets as the English BTGs.

I am very glad to know that your pen is inspired to create, because we are in need of many intelligent writers who can express our Krishna consciousness philosophy nicely just following exactly the transcendental words and purports of our vast Vedic scriptures according to the previous Acaryas of our Gaudiya Vaisnava Sampradaya. And if you continue to work in this writing and publishing of our literatures with steady enthusiasm and sincerity, your success in Krishna Consciousness is certain. Therefore to keep your spiritual strength, always observe the regulative principles strictly and chant at least sixteen rounds of beads daily without fail. This is essential for understanding our philosophy practically to advance in Krishna Consciousness. And we should always avoid mental speculations.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
