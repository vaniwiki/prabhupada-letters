My dear Daughter Manmohini,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter dated 18 February, 1970, along with your beads for chanting and a pair of lovely flower garlands. Thank you very much.

I have immediately offered the flower garlands to Radha and Krsna and they are so nice looking. I am very happy to accept you as my disciple and I am glad to know that you are praying to Lord Krsna only that you may always remember that your position eternally is to serve and take shelter of His transcendental lotus feet. So I am returning your beads duly chanted by me, and your spiritual name is Manmohini Dasi. Manmohini is another name of Radharani and Manmohini dasi is the maidservant of Radharani. Now please chant Hare Krsna mantra and be sublimely happy.

You know that as my initiated disciple you must chant regularly sixteen rounds of beads daily and follow the four restrictions; namely no eating of meats, fish or eggs; no illicit sex life; no taking of any kinds of intoxicants; and no gambling or mental speculation. If you stick to these principles and chant the Holy Name avoiding the ten offenses in the matter of chanting you will become steady and rapidly advanced in Krsna Consciousness.

I am very pleased to note that you are nicely engaged in preparing Bhoga at the Boston temple and you are also going on Sankirtana. Please study very carefully all our books and learn our philosophy with the help of our many experienced students there in Boston, and remain happy in Krsna Consciousness under the care and guidance of Sriman Satsvarupa and Sriman Brahmananda as you are their younger sister.

I am enclosing herewith one sheet listing the 26 qualifications of a devotee, the ten offenses to be avoided in chanting the MahaMantra, and standard practices for initiated devotees.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
