My dear Sukadeva das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 10, 1975. Your letter will be reviewed during the Mayapur annual meeting. That is the time to take up such matters. You all should co-operate and then things will go on very nicely. We should not bring in politics. That is a very nasty thing. Anyway, this matter will be reviewed at Mayapur. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
