My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am simply remembering your face when you were crying in the plane. Please don't be agitated in any way. Please remain fixed up in Krishna Consciousness and you will always be happy. And now you have got a very nice assistant, Madhavi Lata devi, and she is also very good and sincere girl, so you will have good company to talk, and paint; wherever you may be, Krishna is always with you, as He is always with everyone. But everyone who is in Krishna Consciousness can know Krishna is with him. Others do not know. In the Bhagavad-gita, Krishna says that I am the Supersoul everywhere. So Krishna is so kind that He is always with us as Friend; if we can learn to treat Him with our friendly love and affection the reciprocation is permanent, and that is the highest success of our human form of life. I shall be glad to hear from you at your convenience. And chant always joyfully Hare Krishna. Thank you very much. Hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Here, Anapurna and Govinda dasi, they are very nice girls, helping me in all respects. Anapurna has gotten a letter from her father in London, and may be we shall be very soon going there, and formulate a Sankirtana party with the help of some San Francisco students.
