====== Letter to: Umapati ======

Paris

My dear Woompati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21 January, 1970, and I have conveyed your good suggestion to Suridas and Jotilla to go to Hamburg. As Tamala is already informed of this fact, I am sure he will take this practical suggestion and do the needful.

Regarding antiques: we do not require of them in our Temple. For the time being don't spend money on antiques, better to try to expand our cult as far as possible with strenuous effort.

So I am getting good reports from all our centers. Now I will be very much pleased to have our own center in Paris as soon as possible. I am so much thankful to you for your sincere endeavor to spread Krishna Consciousness in the European countries.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
