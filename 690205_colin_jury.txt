My dear Colin Jury,

I thank you for your letter which was sent along with Yamuna's. I am pleased to hear that you are anxious to meet me, and I will be pleased to meet you when I go there. But first there must be a nice house secured. Our society is now legalized in London, so there should be no difficulty in securing a house immediately. Please help the devotees there to do this. I am simply awaiting their letter to start for London. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
