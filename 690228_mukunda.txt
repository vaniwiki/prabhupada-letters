My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated February 23, 1969, and I have noted the contents with much pleasure. I am enclosing herewith the copy of __Easy Journey To Other Planets__*. Also enclosed is some pages of __Isopanisad,__ so you can show them to Mr. Maschler and complete the business for their publication. I was so glad to learn from your letter that you will be able to sell __Back To Godhead__ to the extent of 5,000 copies at least, and please arrange for this.

About Sankirtana movement, in New York, Brahmananda has also begun Sankirtana in different colleges, and I quote herewith a few lines from his letter; "You will be pleased to know that we had a very successful kirtana engagement at two colleges in Pennsylvania, Dickenson College and Franklin and Marshall. At Dickinson the students were so enthusiastic that practically all of them (50 at least) were all dancing, what to speak of everyone singing and clapping. Even the professor, a dried stick scholar, danced in ecstasy." So in the future we will stick to the principle of Sankirtana movement and distributing our __Back To Godhead__ specifically and the other literature generally. I am pleased to note that you are printing up 10,000 copies of the __Prospectus__ of our society. Also your proposal of getting 1,000 subscribers to __Back To Godhead__ from London alone is very encouraging and please do it. You should send your activities report every month in short for publication in __Back To Godhead.__

Please convey my thanks to Mr. Parikh because he has taken our movement very sincerely, and Krishna will be very much pleased upon him. Actually it is the duty of all retired men and women to devote themselves in the service of Krishna. That is the basic principle of Vedic civilization.

Thanking you once more. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB; As I am going to Hawaii for the month of March, you may address my mail to Iskcon, 4 Leilani Building, 1649 Kapialani Blvd., Honolulu, Hawaii.\\
