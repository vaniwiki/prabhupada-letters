My dear Tusta Krishna Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 14, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the U.S. 226 dollars and the A. 50 dollars daksina. I am very glad to hear that you are keeping yourself busy preaching. Don't become a dead man. Always preach.

It is very nice here in Melbourne. The temple is very beautiful. I will leave from here on the 23rd for Fiji and stay there for two days. Then I shall go to Honolulu and stay for at least one month.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
