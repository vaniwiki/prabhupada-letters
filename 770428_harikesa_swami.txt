I am enclosing sanctified threads for Pavanesana, Airavata, Ajata das, and Kamadhena das. Also gayatri mantra is enclosed. Have them hear the tape through the right ear, and hold a fire yajna. Instruct them to firmly follow the rules and regulations.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
