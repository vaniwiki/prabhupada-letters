My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and noted reports of work there at your center and with great satisfaction. Please do it nicely. You are intelligent and Krishna will give you more and more intelligence to serve Him. I shall ask Jayananda for the permit and he will send it to you, along with the information required.

You will be glad to know that we lost our Hollywood temple, but by Grace of Krishna we have got a better place at a cheaper rent already on the Melrose avenue. And we are going to occupy the same within a day or two if all goes as planned. Everything is going on nicely here, and please keep me informed with regular reports of your activities there. If you think so, Gary can be initiated by post and you can arrange it for him.

Hope you are all well there,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
