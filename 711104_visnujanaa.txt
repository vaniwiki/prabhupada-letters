====== Letter to: Visnujana ======

San Antonio, Texas

Dear Visnujana das Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil, and have noted the contents carefully.

It is very encouraging for me to hear that my Sannyasis are traveling and preaching. Regarding keeping our temples clean, this is essential. Unless we can maintain the temples we presently have superexcellently clean, we should not open new centers.

Two men may remain at the temple and clean thoroughly every day and the rest should go to the streets for sankirtana. For Spiritual life chanting Hare Krishna is sufficient but because we are habituated to unclean habits we must have temple worship. Sankirtana will keep everyone's mind clean and surely this quarreling will cease.

The best thing would be if you could combine the Road show with visits to cities that have existing temples. In this way you could enliven the devotees tremendously. We must keep our existing centers strong.

This will be the greatest preaching program if you can travel and distribute literature. I have experience in Sydney when I spoke at the University, the students bought my literature.

Enclosed are sacred threads for Sri Galim das and Dvija Hare. As far as Kunja be Hari is concerned you please consult with Karandhara on this matter.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
