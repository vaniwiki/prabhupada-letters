Trinidad

My dear Citsukhananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am glad to receive your letter dated July 5, 1974 and have noted the contents. You can immediately secure that land, and I am asking Saurabha from Vrindaban to send you the sample plans exactly like our Vrindaban temple. When the time is ripe, I shall be very glad come there and open the temple.

Krishna may bless you because you are doing so much for Krishna. Try to have a nice temple for Krishna at Trinidad. It is an important place.

I Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
