My dear Ramesvara & Co.,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 31, 1975 and the six new volumes of Caitanya Caritamrta. So the books have increased, and they are all very nicely done. I think I may stop all touring and just sit down here for translating. You have taken seriously the publishing and also the distribution of these books, and that is the success of our mission. You have taken seriously this work and I know that my guru maharaj is pleased with you because he wanted this. So by this your endeavor you will all go back home back to Godhead.

Let me first of all finish Srimad-Bhagavatam, then we can take up others. So I wish to also thank you for your cooperation. Because of your cooperation, therefore I has been possible. For me to publish alone the first three volumes, I had to take so much trouble, but by the cooperation of you American boys and girls now this has become possible.

You promised on Vyasa Puja Day, and it has come, although Nitai has come a little late just after our ceremony. Anyway, what you have done is good. Nitai has said he has brought advance verses for 7th Canto, and this will help me. Nitai was to come on the 20th but now he has come with the substance, so I am very much pleased.

The pictures are all wonderful. The artists tease me with so many questions, about this and that, but they have done nicely, so it is all right. So you all go on with your work, and I will pray to Krsna for your ever advancement in His service.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
