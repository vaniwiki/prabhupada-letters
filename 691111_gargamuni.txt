My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 6, 1969, and I thank you very much for your bank deposit receipt. Practically you are the only hope who is filling up the gap in my Book Fund deposit account. Recently I have issued one check for $4,000 from my Book Fund to the Iskcon Press account. Out of that, you have already fulfilled the amount of $2,500. So I thank you very much. Regarding your business, Krishna will surely help you, and He is already helping you. We want to show the world that Krishna's service is not stereotyped, one-sided. Krishna can be served from any position, provided one is willing to serve Him. Krishna can be served and approached by businessmen, by lawyers, by scientists, by artists, by musicians, by philosophers, even by thieves and rogues; everyone. He is so kind. One has simply to accept the prescribed method how to approach Him. When I speak of thieves and rogues I do not mean that a Krishna devotee is also a thief or rogue. The idea is that even the thieves and rogues are eligible to accept this path of Krishna Consciousness and make their lives sublime. Actually, when a thief or rogue takes to Krishna Consciousness he soon becomes a saintly person. Just like Jagai and Madhai: They were thieves and rogues, but after being favored by Lord Nityananda they became first-class devotees. So Krishna Consciousness is so nice that everyone can approach the goal, and if one simply agrees to follow the prescribed method, very soon he becomes a saintly person.

Regarding your sales report, I think it is encouraging, and the profit should be expended in the manner as I have already suggested in my last letter. Regarding Bina Musical Stores, I am sending herewith their invoice dated 30th August, 1969 and the shipping documents of Nedlloyd & Hoegh Lines (B/L 30). So you will have to pay only the freight, $129.00, and clear the goods. I do not know whether you have already received these documents through the Bank of Baroda because that was arranged with them. If not, you can do the business with these documents. The invoice #14528, dated 30th August, 1969, is for 5 cases of musical instruments. In the invoice you will find one piece "Bina Sangeet Model Harmonium". This should be kept aside for my personal use. It is not for sale. Other items are for sale. There is another item, one Big Size Khol, or mrdanga. You will see how the quality is and kindly report so that we can order for more.

Tamala Krishna is scheduled to arrive here this evening. He has not come yet. Iskcon Press has very nicely printed our __Peace Formula__ and __Two Essays.__ They are also cheap, so I hope you will order them 2,000 copies. Our __BTG__ appearance is coming out nicer. Everyone approves. So by Krishna's Grace I find all sides bright. My only request to all of you is to keep it bright. Don't let it go dim. That is Krishna's Glories. When Tamala comes we shall talk with him about the World Sankirtana Party program.

In further regards to your recent contribution, this time you have deposited the money in the wrong number. My account number is 12410, but I see on the receipt the number is noted as 12416. In the future you should be careful about the number. In the meantime you rectify this mistake with the bank when you get time. I am returning the receipts herewith for your reference.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
