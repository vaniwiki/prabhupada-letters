Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your express letter of 4 April, 1974 along with the list of needed checks and I have examined the contents.

As far as the checks needed for Vrindaban construction I am handing them along with this letter by hand delivery by Gurudasa who is here now. One check listed by you for Rs 23,000 to Punjab National Bank has already been send separately by express post. the other checks are all given to Gurudasa.

Regarding the offers of land in different places, you should take them. First accept them, then we shall see how to manage them. We will have to import brahmanas to man them. If our men are trained, one man can run a place. One experienced man can sit down in a hut and simply talk about Krsna and organize the local people. This is how I started in the beginning at 26 Second Avenue in New York City. If there is genuine preaching they will be attracted, so long the preacher has no self motivation, but simply chants and preaches. Anyway, take the offered land.

Now work in consultation with Gurudasa and Saurabha go ahead for the completion of our Krsna Balarama temple in Vrindaban.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
