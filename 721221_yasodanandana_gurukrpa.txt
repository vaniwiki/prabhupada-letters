====== Letter to: Yasodanandana, Gurukrpa ======

Coimbatore, India

My dear Yasodanandana and Gurukrpa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 3, 1972, and I have very much appreciated hearing from you the news of your successes in preaching tour. You are the pioneers preachers in South India. That is very important portion of India, and there is much to do there in future, so you are paving the way. I know that you are both best preachers and you will not stand by idly and listen to any nonsense ideas or mayavadis. That is very nice.

My Guru Maharaja was also inclined toward his bolder preachers. Therefore I am requesting that both of you, with your party, join me very soon at the Hare Krishna Festival in Bombay Cross Maidan, at least you should come by January 1st. This is our big opportunity to emphasize our preaching strength to the big men of India and population in general. There is arrangement of "Questions and Answers" tents for the general public, just by the main street of the city, wherein we shall conduct throughout day and night preacing by my disciples by answering any and all questions put forward by the public. I think that you will enjoy preaching in that way, and I want to place my best preachers there for that purpose of defeating all challengers. Kindly oblige and do the needful.

Hoping this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
