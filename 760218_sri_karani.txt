My dear Sri Karani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of two checks, one for U.S. $8,000.00 and the other for U.S. $4,000.00 from you and your brother. I thank you very much.

The monies will be deposited into our Bhaktivedanta Book Trust account for printing books. I am instructing our Los Angeles BBT headquarters to send half of all of the books printed to you and half to your brother. One full set of all of our books between you. They will send air freight prepaid.

Recently we have received many acclaims by prominent educators, scholars and scientists throughout the world for our books. Dr. R. E. Asher, Professor of Linguistics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland said, "It is axiomatic that no book can be expected entirely to satisfy all it's potential readers. Her is one, however, which can be said to come remarkably close to ideal...Here we have the ideal of what an edition of a Sanskrit text for a western audience should be...It is beautiful planned and printed..."

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
