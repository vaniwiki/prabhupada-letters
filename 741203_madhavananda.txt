My dear Madhavananda das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 1, 1974 and have noted the contents. Of course I was here in India, so I could not attend your Diwali-Govardhana Puja function, but I understand it was very nice.

I am glad to understand that you are living and working peacefully with the others there. This is required. If we also fight and preach Krishna consciousness, what will people say? Therefore Lord Caitanya has stated: __trnad api sunicena taror api sahisnuna.__ Another symptom of a sadhu or spiritually advanced man is described in Srimad-Bhagavatam by Lord Kapila: __titiksavah karunikah suhrdah sarva dehinam__ [[books:sb:3:25:21|(SB 3.25.21)]]. The symptoms of a sadhu is that he is tolerant, merciful, and friendly to all living entities.

I may also refer to a letter to you from Mr. Mody dated November 1, 1974. It appears that Kausalya has annoyed him very much so that he could resign his membership. So I want to know what is the cause.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
