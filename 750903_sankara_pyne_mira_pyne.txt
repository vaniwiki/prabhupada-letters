My dear Sankara and Mira:

Please accept my blessings. I am very much pleased with your Vyasa Puja offerings. Both of you have done very well. I am very pleased to know you are making progress in Krishna Consciousness and following the rules and regulations. Next time when I come to Calcutta, I shall initiate Mira. In the meantime go on with your duties as prescribed by me which will be always pleasing to me.

Thanking you very much.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
