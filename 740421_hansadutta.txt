Bhaktivedanta Manor

Dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your GBC report of April 11, 1974.

Your activities in book publication and distribution in the German and other European languages is very engladdening to me. I am enclosing the latest letter I have received from Wolf Rottkay and I am glad you have been able to engage him; cultivate this man, he is an important elderly professor in a U.S. university and wants to be engaged in Krsna Consciousness. Your chart for reporting book and record distribution is approved by me, as from this chart I can quickly see how the centers are doing. Yes, by all means you may print my morning walk speaking about "Life comes from Life" into a small book; this argument should be spread, as any intelligent man will be convinced that our discussion is thoroughly scientific and exposes the so called materialistic scientists as rascals. So go on printing and distributing as many books as possible; this is your real work and your personal success. From you report of an hour long kirtana at Moscow Airport, I understand that the sankirtana movement has already begun there and now it will go on further.

I am also enclosing the names of 13 new disciples recommended by your. This is the result of our preaching propaganda, when our family members increase. Now be very careful to see to the growth and protection of the devotional creeper of these new devotees in your charge.

By now I hope you have received my telegram and letter sent to Hamburg advising you to go to Bhaktivedanta Manor for managing affairs there. There were so many letters and reports coming from Mukunda, Puranjana, Bhaja Hari, Prabhu Visnu and then contrary reports from Madhavananda and with Shayamasundar away affairs seem perilous. I hope you are able to settle things up in regard to the debt of the Bury St. temple and temple organization at the Manor. Now Shayamasundar has wired me that he will send tickets for myself and three secretaries for coming to London. I have asked him to send me tickets and I can leave India for London about May 1st. As I have already informed you I am going to Paris the second week of May and Bhagavan das is arranging for a tour of Geneva, Rome and Sweden. I may also visit cities in Germany if you will arrange for that. So when I arrive in London if Syamasundara sends tickets, or when I arrive in Paris, I shall discuss these matters further with you. Now we are in South India at Hyderabad and will visit the Balaji temple in Tirupati and then return to Bombay prepared to leave for London on May 1st.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
