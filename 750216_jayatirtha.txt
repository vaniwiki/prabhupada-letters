My dear Jayatirtha Das,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted Jesus's for 1st initiation upon your recommendation. His name is Yaduvamsi. His beads may be chanted by Kirtanananda Svami. I have also accepted Aroudha, Vidambha, Pujana, Sastramayi, Jalakara as my duly initiated brahmanas. You should allow them to hear through the right ear, the tape of myself saying the gayatri mantra. Please make sure that these devotees follow very strictly all of our regulative principles and chant at least 16 rounds daily. Then they will not go away from us.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
