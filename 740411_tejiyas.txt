Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. In reponse to your telephonic message I beg to enclose herewith check number PJH 365504 for Rs 17,600 in favor of the Punjab National Bank. Yes, %%_%% also I sent eight checks totalling Rs 43,614.63 (Rupees forty three thousand, six hundred and fourteen and sixty three paise only) through Gurudasa Adhikari. Before that a check for Rs 24,000 and another for Rs 23,000 was also sent to you. The check for Rs 24,000 for Rajastani Moorti Kala Kendra is understood as not sent to Jaipur. Anyway, this check should be considered cancelled. Another check for Rs 19,005 has been issued and now today's check of Rs 17,600. So make a list of statements and see what is the balance is in the bank now. In my calculation the balance is now Rs 18,745.81. (Rupees eighteen thousand, seven hundred forty five and eighty one paise). Please confirm this.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
