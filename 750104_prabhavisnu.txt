My dear Prabha Visnu das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated Dec. 17 and Dec. 27th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Your festival sounded very nice. Go on like this. Regarding book distribution, this is my foremost desire to have my books circulated profusely. I have just discussed with Hansadutta about lowering the prices for England. Keep the grounds there nicely. That is important. I am glad to hear how nicely the cows are doing. Send some milk here.

Madhavananda is being sent to Hong Kong to collect for Krishna-Balarama Mandira in Vrndavana.

As far as the initiations are concerned, Hansadutta was not so sure about all of them, so he can go over the list with you in London, and after hearing from him, we shall consider.

So, all your desires are fulfilled. You must be very cautious, being president that you set a perfect example so others will not be misled. Always chant 16 rounds and observe our other rules and regulations strictly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
