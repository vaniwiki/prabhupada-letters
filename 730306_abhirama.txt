My dear Abhirama:

Please accept my blessings and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your unsigned report dated the 18th of February. I have just arrived here a few days ago and by the 15th I shall go to Mayapur on the festival celebration of Lord Caitanya's Appearance Day. We are expecting many thousands to visit there and our nice building is almost completed.

Yes, your appointment as the new president of the Miami Temple is completely approved by me, now take advantage and preach among all the young people there and recruit some good men. For some time now I have been thinking to have a nice place in Florida and now it looks like you are trying for it.

As far as the Deities are concerned, we do not want to repeat the same mistake again, so it is better that you wait to get some more brahmanas before installing Them again. For worshiping the banyan tree, the representation of Krsna, simply offer a little flower, incense and water. Of course, now I am trying to get more valuable time for my translating of __Bhagavatam,__ so you may consult in these matters with Rupanuga Maharaja, your GBC representative.

Yes, you are feeling increase in strength with increase in service, and I am not the actual bestower of mercy, rather I am just a messenger for Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. So just work hard for Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His mercy will fall upon you like torrents of rain in the monsoon season.

I hope this meets you in good health and I beg to remain
