My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of 7, December 1968 and have duly noted the contents.

Regarding my plans for January I can not as yet give a definite answer because I have recently been invited to visit the South American country, Guyana at the beginning of the new year. So this too is undefinite and I will have to see whether they provide for our visit or whether will not before I can decide if I may go to Hawaii in January. I am sending the letter out today asking for confirmation of this invitation and just as soon as I hear word, I will let you now so you may make your arrangements. I have included a copy of my letter to Mr. Dindayal who is the person who has extended our invitation.

So I am pleased that you are all working very hard to help us in this great mission. Please convey my blessings to Mahapurusa, Murari, Lilavati and to their child Subhadra. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
