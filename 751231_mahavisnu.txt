My dear Mahavisnu Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings I am in receipt of your letter dated December 12, 1975.

It is very unfortunate that Savitri devi dasi met with such a bad accident. The material world is full of danger at every step. Even a great devotee like Bhisma met his end by being pierced with hundreds of arrows, but he was so powerful that he waited in that condition to see Lord Krishna before he passed away. These are the examples of Bhagavatam, and we have to try to follow the instructions of such great personalities. Please offer my blessings to this nice girl and prayers for her well being.

Regarding your getting married, I have no objection. However as a brahmacari you are not obligated to marry, what is the advantage to your getting married? That should be considered. If one can remain brahmacari that is best. Finish this life and go back to Godhead, that is the basic idea of Krishna consciousness movement. So you decide.

The Edinburgh temple may be moved. However Hansadutta Prabhu has suggested that if it is to be moved why not move it to Birmingham or Manchester where there will be more facility to preach and make life members and devotees.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. As you have recommended, I accept Jagaddhatri devi dasi for 2nd initiation. Now you must hold a fire ceremony. She should hear the mantra from the tape recording through the right ear. Brahmana initiation means to be very clean, inside and outside. Inside by chanting the glories of the Lord, and outside by bathing regularly, washing hands and mouth after eating. Instruct her on all of these things and do it yourself, as "EXAMPLE IS BETTER THAN PRECEPT."
