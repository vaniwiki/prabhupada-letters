Tehran

My dear Nandarani dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the information you sent in your letter of June 10, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care.

Try to publish Persian books as many as possible. That will be a big success. Iranians have very much respect especially for the Americans and your dealings with them will be very much appreciated. Also, if the collections are very good there you can send some money to Gargamuni Swami in Mayapur for the project.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. I am scheduled to visit Tehran for several days in August.\\
