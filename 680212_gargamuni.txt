My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 10, 1968, and have noted the contents. The matter is little more risky in the sense that the rent is $400 per month, but you have assurance from friends and your own resources of $250, so balance is $150 which I think you can collect from the meetings very easily. So far I am concerned I always take risk for Krishna. I came here in your country risking my life. And still although I am physically unfit, I am trying to execute the orders of my Guru Maharaja as far as possible. So to take risk for Krishna is very good. You know the history of my starting the society in 1966, it was all risky, and I was alone, but I took it depending on Krishna. So I think if you take the risk of $150, for Krishna's sake, Krishna will supply you the required money undoubtedly. It depends however on your personal discretion, but I am hopeful that if you take the risk it will not be bad. In the meantime, Upendra is also released earlier from his internment, and I think if he takes some job he can also help. So try to open this branch and let us depend on Krishna's Good Will.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
