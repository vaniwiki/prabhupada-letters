My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I reached Boston as scheduled on December 21st, and there was a good reception by the devotees for Krishna's servant. The newspaper article published remarked on this occasion that "in the Logan Airport there has never been anything like this." It was exactly like the reception you arranged in London on September 11, 1969. I hope everything is going nicely in London temple.

As advised by George I expected his remittance last Monday or Tuesday, but failing to receive it, I advised Brahmananda to contact you on the phone. He tried four times, but could not do so. I wanted to send the order of __Krsna__ to Dai Nippon, but as I have not received any information of the money, I have not sent the order as yet. Please therefore advise me immediately at the Los Angeles address: 1975 So. La Cienega Blvd. Los Angeles, California 90034. Upon hearing from you I shall do the needful. In case the remittance has not as yet been dispatched, please do it immediately directly for credit in my checking account #3081-61625, Bank of America (Branch No. 308) 8501 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90035, and advise me also.

I hope this meets you in good health. My blessings for Malati and Sarasvati. The new child born of Harsarani may be named Govinda Das.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am going to L.A. this morning
