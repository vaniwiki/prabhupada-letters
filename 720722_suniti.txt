My dear Suniti,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 13, 1972, describing the condition of your husband, Jaya Gopala das. Whatever happens we must take it as the special mercy shown by Krsna to his devotee. Yes, the reading of Krsna Book and chanting at his bedside must go on. I am offering prayers to Krsna that He may protect Jaya Gopala, who is such sincere devotee. Now you and your godbrothers and godsisters also continue to offer prayers and chant always the Hare Krsna Mantra for him, and this will save him under any conditions.

Hoping this will meet him in improved condition of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
