My dear Aksobhya das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter regarding the Krishna Bowl game, and it should be stopped immediately. This thing will be a taxation on the brain on the young children. Why are you inventing? Why you are not satisfied? You are all only inventing and spoiling money. You should teach the children perfectly Sanskrit and English instead of spoiling time and money. The children cannot pronounce correctly the Sanskrit. Let them read it correctly, that is wanted first. They must pronounce nicely English and Sanskrit. The English is no difficulty. If you can do this, then your education is all right.

You may introduce contests, but if the children and also the older devotees cannot pronounce Sanskrit correctly, it is all a useless waste of time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
