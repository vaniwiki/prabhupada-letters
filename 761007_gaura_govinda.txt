Bhuvaneśvara

My dear Gaura Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 1st inst. and have noted the contents. Nityananda Kanungo, the father of Bijayananda, can give you information about that land. He is a very famous man, and he lives in Cuttack. Otherwise Bhavananda may be able to give some assistance.

You may send me copies of your new publications.

I hope this meets you well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
