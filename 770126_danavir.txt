Dear Danavir,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 11th along with enclosures regarding the Bhakta Program and it is very nice.

It is good to hold more classes with the bhaktas, but they should all be on the basis of our books. You should not go beyond the jurisdiction of our teaching. The idea of theater, based on Bhagavatam topics is also a very good way to introduce the philosophy to the people in general. Go on preaching with vigorous enthusiasm and increase your program for bringing new men to live in Krsna Consciousness.

You yourself must be ideal in following the rules and regulations, rising early, and restricting eating and sleeping. The less a person is concerned with material enjoyment such as eating, sex and sleeping, the more he is spiritually advanced. If the "devotee" himself lives like a hog or dog how can he preach?

We are planning to construct a temple here in Puri and I was instructing the GBC that we can invite anyone to come and stay with us for three days and we shall supply room and board. In that time, however, he should rise early and attend our programs. After three days if he likes he can stay with us permanently, become shaven headed, engage as we request him, and we shall take care of all his necessities.

Yes, your plan to have all temple presidents report the scores on new men recruited is approved by me. You can keep count which temple is recruiting the most men, just as they keep count of the book distribution. Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
