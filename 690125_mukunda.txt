====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 22, 1969, and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. You have written to say that Londoners there are all so very anxious to meet me, so I am also very much anxious to meet you and the Londoners. Therefore it is the best thing that the five-story house which you have described in the letter under reply may be immediately occupied.* You can offer the best reasonable rent, and you can take the risk depending upon Krishna. If the Beatles come forward, you can take the risk. I hope that Mr. Parikh, who is a veteran educationist, can help you very much in this connection. I am very much pleased that he is also on the board of managers committee.

Your Sankirtana Movement there is growing in popularity, and therefore you must immediately have a nice place. I think that for this purpose the five-story building is quite suitable. The first floor can be used as a meeting room or kirtana hall. The second floor can be used as temple room. The third floor can be used for prasadam distribution. The fourth and fifth may be used for residence and propaganda office.

Now the legal document of incorporation under the company act has been examined by me, and I think that it is all right. I have made a little change somewhere, and you can do the needful. So by showing this legal document, you can immediately occupy some magnificent temple house.

Regarding your seeking publication of __Easy Journey to Other Planets,__ I am very glad to hear this, and I understand that Kirtanananda Swami has a nicely edited copy of this. I have already asked him to send me this copy, and when I examine it, I will send it immediately to you. In the meantime you can finalize the negotiation.

So I am very pleased with the good news your letter has brought. I hope this will meet all of you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: There is a Mr. Ivan Levine in the Montreal temple who is, I understand an expert trumpeteer. He may be interested in joining you in London with his wife, after their initiation probably, to join you in your musical activities in London. I have advised him to write to you about this.\\
* If the opening ceremony is made on the 7th of February 1969 the appearance day of my Spiritual Master, then it will be a grand success.
