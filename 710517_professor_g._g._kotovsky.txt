Dear Professor Kotovsky,

I beg to inform you that a letter received from you in my Bombay address was redirected here some four or five days ago, but I have not received it as of yet. It appears that the letter is missing. I therefore request you to issue a duplicate of your letter under reference and send it to me to the above address immediately so that I can take action on it. Thanking you once more.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
