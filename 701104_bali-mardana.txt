====== Letter to: Bali-mardana ======

My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your air letter from Japan dated 18 October, 1970, and I have noted the contents with great encouragement.

It is for your daring and active nature that I have chosen you to represent me as GBC man for the southeast Asia zone, and I can see from your latest words that my choice has not been wrong. I think that Singapore and Hong Kong are English-speaking places so that you will not find much difficulty there. So just open two nice centers immediately and that will link-up our chain of centers around the world.

The basic principle of our actions should be that they are all meant for pleasing Krsna. If we act always in this consciousness automatically everyone will be attracted to devotional service, and this is the secret of our preaching work. If you simply practice the regulative principles which I have introduced you will remain pure. Factually this is our only strength. I have seen better orators, better scholars and better organizers but no one is becoming pure by following regulative principles. Simply because we rise early, take bath, chant sixteen rounds and strive with every activity to please Krsna---this is what impresses others.

Please report to me fortnightly, and correspond with your other GBC men as well. I request that you always display and distribute my books wherever possible.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
