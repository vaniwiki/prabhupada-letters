Dear Bhaktin Susan Newman:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. Do not waste your time with this study of monkeys. What will you learn by this? Better to hear from Lord Krishna Himself in Bhagavad-gita than to waste your time in this way.

Chant Hare Krishna and read our books very carefully. I am going to New Vrindaban at Janmastami, so you can come there for the celebrations.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
