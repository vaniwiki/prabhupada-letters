My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. It has been some time now since I have heard from you, so I am anxious to receive your letter. Please inform me how you, Govinda Dasi, Balabhadra, Turya dasa and Jayasri are doing. I shall be glad to hear from you about this. You will be pleased to learn that Sudama, his wife Cintamani, and Bali Mardan have gone to Tokyo, and already they are making friends with very influential people there, and they are very encouraged that in Japan there will soon be a nice reception of the Krishna Consciousness Movement. I am very pleased to learn of the progress in Japan, and similarly, I am pleased with the nice progress being made in all of our centers. I arrived in London on September 11th, and there was a grand reception arranged. I am enclosing herewith some newspaper articles which reported on this event. Last Tuesday evening we were interviewed on a very popular program on BBC television. It was quite successful, and I can understand that there is immense potency in England for spreading Krishna Consciousness. I want that there may be at least four or five centers here.

So I shall be awaiting your letter as soon as possible. Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
