My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your very interesting letter dated 11 February, 1970. In the meantime, I have sent you one letter which I hope you have received by this time.

Herewith please find one cover addressed to George Harrison, and I hope you will deliver it with my blessings. I am very glad that his service is effectively working on him, and that is the way of realization, Krsna Consciousness.

The description of Krsna Consciousness movement in London gives me a great pleasure with hope and interest. Lord Caitanya was also checked in His Sankirtana movement by the then police officer, and He led a procession of one hundred thousands of men to the house of the Kazi. So I think Lord Caitanya is planning a situation which will help us in pushing the Krsna Consciousness movement throughout the whole world. I therefore request you all to chant Hare Krsna mantra very rigidly sixteen rounds a day and thus be fixed up in your spiritual strength and everything will come out successful.

The cover of George Harrison is open, and after reading it you can close it and deliver it to him. So far his contribution is concerned, I shall duly acknowledge it as I do usually in the __Krsna__ book also. Besides that, I wish to put his good name on the dedication page of devotional service.* I would have done this in the Isopanisad, but this book was already printed. I hope you like the letter which I have addressed to George.

Hope this will meet you in good health. Offer my blessings to Malati, your daughter, Sarasvati, and all other boys and girls at the Temple.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
