My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated September 13rd, 1969. Regarding the press purchasing, it must proceed on, and Krishna will help you. Don't worry. I understand that you require approximately $14,000 out of which Advaita has $4,500 and you have about $5,000. The balance may be asked from Tamala as the house we are contemplating to purchase is untouchable by us on account of too high price. So Tamala can spare the balance money for the press at the present moment, and when the house will be actually purchased, Krishna will provide us with the money. Anyway, don't be discouraged. Whatever deficiencies will be there, Krishna will supply you, and if there is actually any deficiency, please let me know and I shall send you a check for that amount. I think this will be all right.

In the meantime, I am sending herewith my pass book for the First National City Bank. You go to the bank and make it up and let me know what is the balance there. You can simply let me know what is the balance and the passbook may be kept with you carefully for depositing in my book fund regularly.

Your report that book sales are not very satisfactory is not very encouraging. if it is not selling well in New York, why not dispatch to other centers for distributing? The United Shipping agency has dispatched the books as I understand, and on receipt of this you will kindly let me know how many full sets of __Bhagavatam__ are there. Then I shall instruct you to distribute them in different centers on hearing from you.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
