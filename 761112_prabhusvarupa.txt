Haridasapur

My dear Prabhusvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 8/11/76.

Yes we shall begin work immediately. Where is that Rs. 10,000 which you have already collected. With that 10,000 plus 10,000 from us you can begin work immediately to construct a boundary wall. I am going to Mayapur by the fifteenth instant. From Mayapur I may go to Haridasapur and begin work immediately. Our architect has been ordered to make a design plan. The boundary wall you can begin immediately.

Please chant regularly the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra and observe the regulative principles. Then you'll get spiritual strength.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
