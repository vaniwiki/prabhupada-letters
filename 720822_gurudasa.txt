Vrindaban

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your long letter redirected here from London. Do not be upset. The thing is that the construction work must be begun immediately. Gargamuni is there, I understand, and you are there, and Tamala Krishna is preaching. So if you and Gargamuni can do the work, then there is no need of taking help from Tamala Krishna. So there is no need of talking any more. Begin the work immediately. That I want to see.

I am returning to Vrindaban by October 15, and I want to see by that time that the construction work is going on there. I am here in Los Angeles now, and will be going to New Vrindaban by the end of August.

Please offer my blessings to all the others there, especially to Yamunamayi. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
