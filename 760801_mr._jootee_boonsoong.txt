Dear Mr. Boonsoong,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge reciept of your nice gift of silk cloth which has been presented to me by my disciple Yogesvara Das. He has also spoken to me of your interest in the activities of our movement. I thank you very much.

This Krsna Consciousness Movement is based on the __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ We have attempted to present this great philosophy to the world in a pure way, without material motive, and by the grace of Lord Krsna our effort has come out successful. People everywhere are taking to Krsna Consciousness, following the simple principles, and becoming happy. At least no one has ever seen such high character as in our boys and girls. And thoughtful men like yourself are appreciating.

Again, my thanks for your consideration. Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
