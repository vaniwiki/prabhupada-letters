====== Letter to: Jayapataka ======

Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Please give the enclosed document to Tamala Krishna. What this is for I do not know, so he should see to it and do the needful.

Regarding the new calendar, have you typed it yet and sent one copy to Boston? If not, it should be done immediately. And one copy should be sent here to me. The part dictated to Devananda Swami is already completed and I shall dictate the final part of the calendar in the very near future.

Also, what has happened to my passport? If it is prepared, you can send it here immediately. So far as the beads are concerned, I have sent someone to Vrindaban to inquire there also and so I will let you know about them later on.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am in due receipt of your long letter of 31/3/71. Tamala has gone there & thus I hope everything will be in order. I am anxious to purchase the lands in Mayapur. I wish to stay there for some time at the Birla Dharmasala. Shall be glad to know if you can arrange for this through Sri K. K. Birla or other who has donated the Birla guest House. ACB\\
