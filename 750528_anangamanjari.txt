My dear Anangamanjari devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 23rd, 1975 and have noted the contents. I have given the information in my books, how to please the spiritual master. Simply by following the rules and regulations very carefully, by chanting at least 16 rounds daily, by reading our books, and by always engaging one's self in the service of Krishna, a person will please the spiritual master and Krishna both.

In your country, the Deity should not go without shirt. Gaura-Nitai may wear turbans. Nothing should be offered to Krishna unless it is prepared by the devotees themselves.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
