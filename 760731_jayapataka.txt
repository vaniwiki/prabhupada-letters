Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents carefully. Let Prabhu Svarupa transfer the land immediately, we shall do the needful. You are an intelligent boy so you can take it from me that this Haridasapur scheme is for making a link with Bangladesh, so we have to deal from that point of view. Let him collect the funds and see that it is done properly there. We shall organize a nice organization there. It doesn't matter that he cannot assure the full money. As far as the fresh initiation goes, we shall see later on. I am expecting to receive the land upon arrival.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
