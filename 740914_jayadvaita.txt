My dear Jayadvaita das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 3, 1974. I have the proposed advertisements for BTG and I approve them. I have also seen the article by Brahmananda Swami and it has been returned to you with Dayananda together with corrections.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
