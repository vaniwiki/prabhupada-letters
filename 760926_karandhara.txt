====== Letter to: Karandhara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th inst. and have noted the contents. Regarding the skyscraper scheme, yes, that I have already sanctioned since the idea was given to me by you.

If you make 2500 mrdangas per year, that is very good, then distribute to the whole of American people.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
