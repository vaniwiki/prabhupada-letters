My dear Revatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 1, 1969, and I have signed the letter to the draft board as you have requested. If it will be of help to you, I shall also send you one certificate stating that you are my disciple. I thank you very much for the nice sentiments you have expressed, and surely this nice attitude will be a great asset for your further advancement in perfecting your life in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
