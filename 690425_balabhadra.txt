My dear Balabhadra,

Please accept my blessings. Both Gaursundara and Govinda dasi have highly spoken about your service attitude, and I am so glad to hear about your activities. Krsna has sent you to our association, and I am sure you are intelligent enough to understand our philosophy. Please try to understand us without any doubt. If there is any question, you can send it to me, and I shall be very glad to reply. But try to understand us nicely, and surely you will be very happy. Both Gaurasundara and Govinda dasi are good devotees, and your association with them will be very much beneficial.

I am so glad to learn that your capatis and other preparations are attracting many guests at our love feast. Here also, as well as in Buffalo, things are improving very rapidly. I think that Hawaii is certainly a very good place for a center. While I was there, I enjoyed the climate very much. In comparison to the climate of the Eastern portion of America, Hawaii is certainly a very good place. Next time, when you get many mangoes, if you invite me I shall go there again.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
