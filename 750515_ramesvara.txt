My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. Caitanya caritamrta is complete (12 parts) and only 3 parts are published, and now the 5th Canto is almost finished, so why these books are not being published? This is our first business. Immediately, these pending books (17 in total) must all be published. Why the delay? The US printer's binding is better than Dai Nippon. So, some may be printed in US and some in Japan, but the pending books must be finished in a very short time. When I see so many books pending, it does not encourage me to translate. When I see books printed, I become encouraged to write more and more. We can talk this over more in Hawaii. Now, you and Hansadutta expedite the publishing work. That is your business. And push on the selling. You request Tripurari Maharaja in this connection along with the others. Now, Bhavananda Swami and Gargamuni Swami are there. They are also expert in pushing this on. By combined effort, publish as quickly as possible and immediately Caitanya-caritamrta should be done.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
