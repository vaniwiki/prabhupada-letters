Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 17, 1972, and the pleasure of my again spending some days in Vrindaban is only exceeded by the pleasure of hearing from you the good news of our activities in Mayapur. I am very much encouraged to note the many signs of progress in the building work and other things. You are the best man for this task of being responsible for our world headquarters at Mayapur, thank you very much for helping me in this way.

Regarding the preparation of rice by steaming and then drying, we can offer such rice even it is twice-cooked. Gaudiya Math offers, even during the presence of Prabhupada it was done, so there is no wrong. It is called sidha. I never took sidha except in Gaudiya Math.

Now you have got one very nice Jersey cross-bred cow, so take care of her very nicely. Feed her nicely fodder and she will give more milk.

Never mind coming here, I shall come very soon to Mayapur and speak thrice times what I am speaking here. I am coming there soon to live with you, so do not be anxious.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
