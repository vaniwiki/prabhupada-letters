Dear Mr. Duke:

I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 31, 1975 redirected to me here in India. How can I assist you when I am here in India? If you take away the girl, I have no objection. They come and go, but if the parents take her away, I have no objection. We have no business to keep young girls from their parents. We do not force anyone to go or to stay. It is all voluntary.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
