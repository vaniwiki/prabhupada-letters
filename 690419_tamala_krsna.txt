My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 12, 1969, and I have noted the contents with pleasure. I am glad to learn that two new boys, Robb and Kelly, have moved into your temple. Also, it is good news that you now have a weekly course in the University there. Regarding the draft lawyer, I have enclosed the circular which I am sending out to the temples.

I thank you for the nice sentiments you have expressed in your letter, and I hope this will meet you in good health. Please convey my blessings also to the other devotees there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: I have received the twigs which you have sent to the Buffalo temple, and please continue to send them regularly while I am on the East Coast.

I have also received the checks both for me and Brahmananda. Please consult Mr. Greene and let me know how shall I reply the letter.
