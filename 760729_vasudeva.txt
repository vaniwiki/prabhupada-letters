My dear Vasudeva das;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the undated joint letter from you and Upendra dasa and have noted the contents with care. Regarding the situation in Fiji, it is necessary that we come to a proper understanding as to the status of the land and the organization of ISKCON Fiji itself. The first point is that the governing board of ISKCON may have yourself and your brother as members, but must also have the GBC for the zone, Gurukrpa Swami, the GBC Chairman, Tamala Krsna Goswami , and Upendra das as members. The second point is that after ISKCON has been organized in the above way the land which the temple is being constructed on must be leased to ISKCON Fiji with a 99 year unconditional lease with option to renew which I shall approve.

In case you do not like this arrangement then you may keep the temple as your private property and as my disciple I will give you guidance. But you may not use the ISKCON name to collect funds or to take loans. In this connection until this matter is resolved no loan may be taken from the bank or elsewhere and all collections in the name of ISKCON, must stop. If you desire to keep the temple as private property then Upendra das may return to Hawaii and ISKCON Fiji may be dissolved. If you want to consider this project as an ISKCON project then you must abide by the orders and direction of the GBC, which you do not like to do. Now whatever you like let me know.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
