My dear Gurukrpa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. You have sent some money for Mayapur and Vrindaban projects and I am very much thankful to you. This money was properly utilized for development of the Mayapur and Vrindaban schemes. Now I am in Vrindaban, but you may have been informed that the opening ceremony has been postponed until the temple and asrama are completed.

I would like to know how much money you have collected and how it was spent. Formally it was understood that money was paid to Dai Nippon and BBT paid to M-V Fund.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
