My dear Tamala,

Please accept my blessings. I hope everything is progressing well with you in Paris.

I am enclosing herewith the copies of two letters which will speak for themselves. Please immediately let me know what is the actual situation regarding this matter.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
