My dear Dixit das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 23rd and have noted the contents. Yes your idea about minimizing the expenses of the Juhu project are very good. I have just written a letter to Giriraja suggesting that they do this and the way is to localize the collecting program. They should collect their funds from the local people in Juhu and Veille Parle Scheme. So I have given them a plan for taking subscriptions from respectable men who are living in that area. So I may request that you help them to make these subscriptions amongst the local inhabitants. I think if you work with them in this way then everything will be alright.

Service to Krishna is the perfection of all relationships.

You may know that we have had to postpone our temple opening here due to the buildings not being completed, but we hope to complete by three months time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
