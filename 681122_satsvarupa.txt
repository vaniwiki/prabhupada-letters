My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of Nov. 20, 68 along with the 1st tape of this term. The 2nd tape is already sent to you and the 3rd tape is enclosed herewith please find. When typing, please mention the tape No. I hope to send you new tapes regularly & I hope you will do the needful.

I understand that the 3rd Canto full and 4th Canto up to date are with you. Please keep them with you & let me know when they are ready. Most probably we shall start our own press very soon. And as soon as the press is started we shall immediately begin printing of Bhagavatam & other books.

Please let me know if Devananda has any binding experience. Whether he can teach some boys here to bind nicely. Unless I am certain that everything in all press department will be done by ourselves I am not inclined to start the press. I have duly received the copies of prospectus sent by you.

Thanking you once more,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
