====== Sivananda ======

My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I understand from Krishna Das that you are improving in your health. Please take care of your health, and the two boys who are with you are just like your junior brothers and they will take care of you also. You can do whatever you find convenient because I know that whatever you do must be in accordance with our Krishna Consciousness movement. But do not leave these boys alone for the time being. They will never interrupt in your activities, they will obey your orders, and you will live there as their senior guardian, as my representative. Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
