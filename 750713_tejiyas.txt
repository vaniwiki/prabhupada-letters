====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejiyas das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 1, 1975 and have noted the contents. It is nice that Mr. Agarwal wants to construct a temple for us in Meerut. It is a good, big city.

Regarding the Jaipur land, yes it is situated in an important place, a good locality although a little deserted. If Mr. Jaipuria gives the land and builds the temple, we can take it. Many pilgrims go there. I am enclosing a copy of my letter to him.

It is a very good suggestion to open the vanaprastha institute. The elderly people can live there according to the Vaisnava principles and worship the Deity and take prasada. I also want to open the Varna Ashrama College there as there is sufficient land.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. You should check with the authorities that we can get an import license for importing printing paper in an equivalent amount to all the foreign exchange we have sent to India. We can print the books there, and many will be exported to Africa, U.K., Fiji, etc.\\
