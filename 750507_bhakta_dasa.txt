My dear Bhakta dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am due receipt of your letter dated April 15th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to hear all of the good news in your letter. This is very encouraging. Continue to preach vigorously, following all of the rules and regulations very carefully and Krishna will give you every facility. It sounds like the Rathayatra festival will be bigger than ever this year. I am hoping to come there again.

Regarding your physical malady, you should do whatever is required to treat it properly. Whatever is most practical. The names for the new child are approved by me. Circumcision is not important.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
