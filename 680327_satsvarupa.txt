My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 28, 1968, along with enclosures of transliteration made by Pradyumna, and I thank you very much. Regarding your letter dated 17th March, it was within the tape received and I have just opened it. There is no question of changing Boston program. I am engaged here up to 8th of April, after that I shall be free to go to New York. I do not know what is the program in N.Y., because I have not received any program of New York. So ask Brahmananda to send me letter when I shall go to N.Y. I can start for N.Y. after 8th of April any day. So make your program conjointly but for me I am free after 8th from San Francisco. I have already sent you one note about Pradyumna's hospital bill, and as soon as I hear from you, I shall arrange to send you $500 from my personal book fund. I am told by some of my students here that it is very easy to pay the bills by small installment payments, and if that arrangement can be made you may see to it, if it is possible.

Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
