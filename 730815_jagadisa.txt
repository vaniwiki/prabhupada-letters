My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 1, 1973 and I have noted the contents carefully.

The book fund debts should always be cleared very quickly, otherwise how books will come out, so always pay regularly as you collect.

To install Deities in a moving vehicle is not very good. There is always danger of falling and breaking. Sudama already has experience of this. Why is Deity worship being introduced? It should not be introduced because it is very difficult to maintain the standard under such circumstances. If you have picture of Guru Gauranga that is sufficient. You are wondering if you did the right thing by giving the Deities to Sudama, so the answer is no. The deities may be brought back and worshiped in the temple as before. The idea of traveling Sankirtana is to distribute books not to do Deity worship, it is very difficult to maintain the standard of Deity worship in the temple, how will it be maintained in a truck?

Another thing is that opening temples should not be encouraged at this time. Subala did the same thing in Santa fee years ago, why again he is doing the same thing? Hansadutta in Germany instead of increasing the temples and Deity worship he has increased the Sankirtana parties. He is running on 8 New buses and distributing large quantities of literature, this is more important. Neglectful Deity worship means offense. So make propaganda in this way, but in the bus there should not be Deity worship, simply the picture of Guru Gauranga.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
