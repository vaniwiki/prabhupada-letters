====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

London

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings AND OFFER THE SAME TO YOUR good wife Janaki. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25th December, 1970, along with pictures of Regent's Park land and Finchley Road, but I have not yet received the registered packet containing certified memorandum and articles of Association. Anyway, we have now obtained registration of our Society in India (Bombay) and tax exemption also. Now we have got our place in Bombay and we are getting another in Calcutta very soon.

In regard of Regent's Park land we are taking steps to contact Sri Karan Singh, who is already known to Gurudasa and that way of obtaining royal favor is very good. I think Sri Singh will like to help us in this matter, so let us see what Krsna desires. In the meantime continue to work from your end as far as possible. I am so glad that you have decided to return as President of our London Temple. I consider London as our prime center for spreading Krsna Consciousness Movement, so it is very important center and I therefore wanted that you take charge of the affairs and see that things are always improving. Simply offer all your talents and energies in this service of the Lord and know that Krsna promises that for one who surrenders fully unto Him, He fully protects such devotee from all kinds of material distresses and sinful reactions. I hope that Janaki will join you in this work, and you set the example of ideal householders in Krsna Consciousness. I have also received one letter from Janaki and I am replying her separately.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
