Los Angeles

My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. Am in due receipt of your letter dated 4/6/73.

I am still in New York, but if the climate is not suitable, I may be going to Los Angeles very soon.

Your program for traveling on the West coast holding festivals at schools and communes is approved by me. Especially you must try to convince these students to join us. There is nothing else that will save the world from destruction and it is our responsibility to recruit these young educated boys and girls before they become spoiled by the degraded conditions of this so-called human society.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
