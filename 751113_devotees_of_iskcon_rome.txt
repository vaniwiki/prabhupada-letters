Rome

My dear devotees of ISKCON Rome,

Please accept my blessings. I have received from Haihaya recommendations for the following devotees for initiation and I am glad to accept them. Their spiritual names are as follows: Bhakta Tonino---Narakantaka; Bhakta Franco---Sjjanasraya; Bhaktin Miriam---Amohamoha; Bhaktin Subrena---Yoganandakari; Bhaktin Luciana---Vicitravasini; and Bhaktin Micaela---Citrarupini. So the beads may be chanted on by Bhagavan das and be sure to see that all these devotees follow all our rules and regulations, chanting minimum 16 rounds and attending the mangala aroti and the __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ class. This is very important because the __maya__ is very strong, __mama maya duratyaya__ [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]]. But we can easily cross beyond it if we take cent per cent shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna. __Mam eva ye prapadyante/ mayam etam taranti te.__

I have asked Haihaya to remain here in India for helping in the management of the Krishna-Balarama temple in Vrndavana and he has gone there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
