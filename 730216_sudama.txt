My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of 6/2. and I am very much joyful to hear that you are enjoying you preaching activities there in America. Actually this is our real business, preaching, chanting, distributing prasadam and book distribution. This book distribution is especially an important program and it is first class preaching work. So I encourage you to work with all the senior men there in America and encourage them to distribute more and more of this transcendental literature.

As far as your attachment for tending the Deities is concerned by no means this can be considered material attachment, but this is our real desireless state to be always engaged twenty four hours in the service of the Lord. But if the facility for serving the Deities is not there, then we should not be discouraged. This is real detachment. When Caitanya Mahaprabhu was touring all over India He did not bring the Deities with Him. So in our travelling and preaching, Deity worship is not essential but if it is done nicely it can be a very attractive aspect of our preaching work.

After consulting with the GBC I have decided that the far east zone can be managed by Karandhara das for he already has extensive dealing with Dai Nippon etc. So he may look after this area for the time being and in the future we will see what happens.

So now I am seeing more and more that my senior disciples must take an active role in continuing the high standard of purity which has been established in our Vaisnava line. In your travelling from centre to centre, you must be very careful to see that the leaders are observing the principles of chanting 16 rounds, rising early for Mangala Arati, participating in the morning and evening classes, observing the four regulative principles etc., and if there is any deviation from this standard then it is the responsibility of you and the local GBC representative to rectify it immediately. Within these Vaisnava standards which I have put forward lies the spiritual strength of our movement. So you may please do the needful in this regard. I shall be returning to the U.S. in April and I will be looking forward to seeing you at that time. I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
