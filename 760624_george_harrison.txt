George Harrison\\
c/o Bhaktivedanta Manor,

My dear Sriman George,

Please accept my blessings. I would be very much pleased if you can meet me the next time that I am in London. I am scheduled to be there from July 20th to July 26th, 1976, and for further details you can contact Mukunda das. I am looking forward to seeing you again.

Hoping that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
