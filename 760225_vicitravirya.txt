My dear Vicitravirya das,

Please accept my blessings. I have recently thought of a scheme to increase funds in our BBT account. I would like to send Indian goods to you for sales to the devotees and others. In the beginning I can have cloth sent, especially saris. So many others are doing it successfully, we also can be successful. I will have the papers sent through my personal account in Lloyd's Bank and you can deposit all monies received from sales of the saris in my account. You may also keep a percentage of the sales for the London temple. Please advise my secretary if you are able to execute.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
