My dear Sivananda Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12/1/72 and have carefully noted the contents.

For the time being you may suspend the program for taking sannyasa. You may remain with your wife until she recovers and then you may travel together and open branches.

I very much appreciate your attitude in saying "It is not sannyasa so much that I am interested in, its Krishna Consciousness and working to please my Spiritual Master." This is the correct understanding of devotional service, to be engaged one hundred percent in the Service of Krishna, never mind what position you are occupying. Please continue in this way and try to live peacefully with your wife.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
