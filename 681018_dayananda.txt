My dear Dayananda,

Your letter, Dt. 10/17/68 just received.

Please accept my blessings. My program is already above mentioned. Regarding the idea of Prasadam restaurant, I am advocating it since very beginning. If you can manage such Prasadam eating place and the temple at one place it will super-excellent. I shall personally assist you in this affair because I like this idea very much. Our chanting is medicine and our Prasadam is the diet for curing material disease. So I fully agree with your this scheme and you may accept the place as described in your letter dated 17th Oct: which I have just received.

ACB
