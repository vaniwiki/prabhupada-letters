My dear Amogha,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated August 3, 1972 and I have noted the contents. Yes, that is a good idea if you want to return to Djakarta for again opening our center there, along with your wife. It is very encouraging that the citizens in Djakarta have donated for your airline tickets, so that is a good sign. If Madhudvisa has agreed, then you may go there immediately. It is better if you take some men with you for the preaching work and other things. We should not open centers with only two persons, we shall have at least four men. I remember once before you wrote me from Djakarta and informed me that you were going to Australia to find a wife and then you were going to Indonesia. So now your plan is coming true and I think Krsna will give you all facility for continuing as you have proposed.

When the soldiers risk their lives on the battlefield, the government is very much inclined to give them all facilities in their work, even the citizens may be deprived of their comforts. So Krsna takes special appreciation for His devotees who are engaged in risking for His preaching work, and He will give you special care and guidance at all times because you are sincerely trying to serve Him in this way. Thank you very much for your sincere endeavors.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
