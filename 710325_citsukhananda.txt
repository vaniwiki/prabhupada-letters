My dear Citsukhananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 3d March, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so glad to hear that you are now in L.A. discussing final plans for opening one center in Mexico City. That is very encouraging news. I am anxious that we establish centers in major cities all over the globe and Mexico City is certainly an important landmark. Both you and your good wife Candrabali can speak Spanish language nicely, so you are certainly qualified for such a mission.

I am also glad to note that you have begun working on BTG Spanish edition. Actually we want that BTG be printed in every major language and distributed all over the world so that there is no language barrier in taking to our movement. So go there, husband and wife, and make our Mexico City branch a grand success, and Krishna will certainly bestow upon you all blessings.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
