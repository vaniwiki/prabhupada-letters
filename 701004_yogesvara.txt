My dear Yogesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you so much for your letter dated September 21st, 1970, along with your copy of __Who Is God?---A Children's Introduction to Krishna Consciousness__ which I see you have done with great care.

I have gone through the book, and I think it is very nice. Devananda and others have also seen it and have also approved your efforts. But I think this book is meant for somewhat older children, about ten to fifteen years. We are also immediately requiring some books for much younger children, say five to ten years age. Another thing you just see that every and each item and example for discussion is made very clear in continuous context so that it will be easy for their understanding. As you have done this first book it is very good beginning, so you go on writing and improving and make a series of such books and we shall see to their printing.

Also have the pictures done very nicely and in color if possible as it is done by our Art Department in Boston and if you have any questions in this regard you may correspond with them directly. That will be very nice. In the meantime, have all your works read by the other devotees as they may find it convenient to do so and they can give you further suggestions. So go on writing more books; we need many such books for distributing to the public schools as well as for our own schools and send me the draft copies as you make them up. I will be very glad to see to them.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
