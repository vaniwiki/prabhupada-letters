My dear Jadurani,

If Kirtanananda goes to Montreal you can give him one Visnu Picture. I hope you have received the Visnu names sent by me.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. My dear Rayarama, Please keep in touch with Mr. Leo Ypstantin. One Indian gentleman who is here for the last five years as permanent resident, suggests that if my students and admirers submit application to the visa department submit that they want me for their benefit they sanction Permanent Resident Visa: Several other organizations the %%__%% mothers my students as admirers, %%__%% papers have appreciated my work. Why not adopt this procedure before the expiring of my tentative period. Please consult Mr. Ypstantin and let me know his opinion. Show him the cuttings. ACB
