My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 30th June, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I have not gone to London, and so have not received your letter. But I have asked that London forward all my mail here. If I don't receive it, then we can discuss personally when I go there. I will be going to N.Y. very soon.

So far your questions: Narayana appeared as a four-handed full-grown youth before Devaki and Vasudeva; during the prayers offered by Queen Kunti, Krishna's chariot was waiting in the background, Pariksit Maharaja was baby but Krishna appeared full grown but reduced to scale, yes, the paintings may be signed "ISKCON PRESS"; no drawings should be made. Simply you paint the important verses, and less important verses may be avoided. But drawings are not good;

Nobody is free from anxiety. The soul is suffering and that is expressed through the manifested body. Not that the body is suffering separately. Just like, face is the index of the mind. Nobody can see the mind, but by the face it is understood that the person is in good mental condition. So the body suffering is the reflection of the soul suffering. So the king in your painting is not really happy, but rather full of anxieties. That is to be shown. Another example is that when my garments are dirty, I, the living entity, am not taking care of my dress. So from my dress, it appears how I am taking care. Similarly the condition of the soul is expressed through the body. When water is hot, that you cannot show by painting. You cannot paint the heat; you must touch the water. So by seeing the expression of the bodily features, one can understand whether the soul is happy or not.

Lord Caitanya was not holding Sudarsana cakra; simply he was calling; Narada came out of Brahma's heart very little and then grew like a child; Narada entered the body of Narayana. That you have to show yourself. Now can I instruct you? He can enter through any part of the body. Just like so many universes are coming out from all parts of the body of Maha Visnu, so where is the difficulty to understand that the entire creation can re-enter from any part of the body?; Narayana appeared and disappeared to Narada's vision like lightning. So you can show Him almost invisible and speaking.
