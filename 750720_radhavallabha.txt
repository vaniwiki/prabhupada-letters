====== Letter to: Radhavallabha ======

Los Angeles

My dear Radhavallabha das:

Please accept my blessings. In the next issue of "Back to Godhead" you should put one note of thanks to Mr. Alexander Kulik of Laguna Beach California. This boy has kindly paid BBT Dollars 25,000.00 for publication of books.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
