My dear Gaura Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26/10/76.

I have already informed you that I received only one document, which I have received from Gargamuni Swami. I received no sale deed. You may take one certified copy and use that.

I cannot read the Oriyan books, but I thank you very much. Please go on increasing. You can ask for paper from Gopala Krsna. Ask him where he is printing, what his cost is, the size of the paper, etc.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
