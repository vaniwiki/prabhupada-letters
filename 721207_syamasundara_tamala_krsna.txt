My dear Syamasundara and Tamala,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much surprised not to hear from you about the Nair affair. I have tried to contact you by phone, but it is understood that you have left Mr. Valia's place and they could not say where you are. We have sent a telegram today reading as follows: "Anxious to know progress with Nair. Call urgent 83260".

So my definite order is as follows: if the conveyance is not yet signed or there is difficulty, then immediately take back the money from the attorneys (3 lakhs), and make a fixed deposit with the bank for six months.

Hope you are in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
