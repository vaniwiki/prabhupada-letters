My dear Bhakti Steven Knapp,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your long letter how you are appreciating this philosophy. It is said in the Bhagavad-gita that out of thousands of men, only one takes an interest in the perfection of human life. The perfection of human life is to develop one's dormant love for God, and thus be released from the terrible cycle of birth and death. People are so foolish that they simply waste time in temporary pursuits of material happiness, eating, sleeping, defending and enjoying sex life. Especially sex life. The sum and substance of material life is attraction for the opposite sex. The sum and substance of spiritual life is attraction to Krishna.

So to develop attraction for Krishna is not difficult, you simply have to hear about Krishna, his activities, his name, his form and his teaching in Bhagavad-gita. Naturally you will develop love for Krishna, because we are all part and parcel of Krishna. The beginning process is to Chant Hare Krishna, follow the four regulative principles and associate with devotees, and take Prasadam of Krishna. I think you are now living in the temple of Krishna, so these things will be very easy for you to practice.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
