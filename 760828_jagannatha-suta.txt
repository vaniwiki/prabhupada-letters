====== Letter to: Jagannatha-suta ======

Los Angeles

My dear Jagannatha Suta das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 18, 1976 and the separate package containing ten __Back to Godhead__ magazines. Thank you very much for them.

Actually I am dependent on your mercy. If you kindly follow my instructions and continue to push on Krsna consciousness, that will make me very happy. You must very strictly observe the regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds a day and Krsna will give you guidance. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gita, __tesam satata yuktanam bhajatam priti-purvakam dadami buddhi-yogam tam yena mam upayanti te__ [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]], to those who worship Him with love, Krsna gives the guidance so that they can come back to Him. The more you give service to Krsna, the more you become advanced. __Yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau tasyaite kathita hyarthah prakasante mahatmanah__ [ŚU 6.23], "Only unto those great souls who simultaneously have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of the Vedic knowledge automatically revealed." This is the secret of success.

By the way, there has been some disturbance created by the publishing of a few comments on Vallabhacarya in Back to Godhead Vol. 10, No. 8, page 5, column 3, paragraph 2. Kindly avoid comments such as these in future publications.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
