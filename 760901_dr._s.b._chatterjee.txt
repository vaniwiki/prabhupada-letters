Dear Dr. Chatterjee,

Please accept my blessings. Things are deteriorating on account of the loss of God consciousness. This simple method of chanting the Hare Krsna Maha Mantra will awaken God consciousness, and people will become very grateful all over the world. We welcome you to Vrndavana after the 3rd of September. We have got accommodations and whatever prasadam we have got we can give.

If you want to see me in Calcutta, you will have to wait until December when I may arrive there. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
