Calcutta

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter dated January 1, 1973, is in hand, and I have noted the contents with great care. Who tells you not to edit? I have never said. I said to stop this intoxication, but not your editing. You say it is rumor only, but I have heard it several times from other persons. So let it remain as rumor, don't let it be fact. That will give me great hurt. I am also coming to Calcutta soon and we may discuss everything further when I come there. And why you are living with that ganja smoker? He has got his wife and family, so you should separate from him and live in the temple as the others are doing. If there is such complaint against our senior men it does not look well.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
