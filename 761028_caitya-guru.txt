My dear Caityaguru dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 26/10/76.

Yes, Krsna will bless you with good success. Do it rigidly. Krsna will give you strength undoubtedly. I started this movement alone in a foreign country and Krsna gave me all success. Krsna will certainly help you if you simply remain sincere and try to present Krsna consciousness as it is. I know the atmosphere in Chandigarh is very receptive.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
