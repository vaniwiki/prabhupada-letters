Dear Sir:

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your Hindi letter dated May 27, 1969, and I do not know why Gopala Krsna's father is so much upset. I have received one letter from Gopala Krsna dated May 29, 1969 in which he writes "I don't think my parents will have any objections now because I have assured them in telegrams and letter that I am not going to abandon them." I hope this will clear the whole thing. So far as I remember, I met you in San Francisco, if I am right. I hope you are doing well. Thanking you for your letter.

Sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
