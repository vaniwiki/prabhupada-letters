My dear Vrndavanesvari,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated "Victoria Day", and I have noted the contents with pleasure. I have received letters from the Hamburg devotees, and they appear to be very much jubilant to know that you will be arriving on June 27 at 9:30 am. I am also very also very glad that you will be prepared to go there. In my previous letter to Mandali Bhadra, I already informed him that he will act as the editor of the German __Back To Godhead.__ So when you go please set up everything in a cooperative mood. The workers there are very sincere, and upon your joining them, they will be very much encouraged. I am also glad to learn that you are enjoying reading the book, __Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ and now both you and your husband have to preach these teachings of Lord Caitanya in the European countries. So please read our books very carefully, and as soon as there is some question you can ask me. In the future I hope that Mandali Bhadra will translate this book into the German language.

Regarding the first question in your letter about how do we know of the spiritual abodes since once going there no one returns, you should know that the great liberated souls and incarnations who appear from time to time in this material world are not actually coming back, because they are never subject to material contamination or the laws of material nature. For the purpose of delivering the fallen living entities they come here temporarily and then go back when their business is finished, and this is all under the direct order of the Lord. So the appearance of the Lord or the great liberated souls in the material is different from the appearance of the contaminated living entity who is forced to take birth in the material world due to his desire to lord it over the world. In your second question you asked if we will remember the earth, when in Vrindaban, and the answer is certainly. When Narada Muni was talking to Vyasadeva, as you may have read in first volume of our __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ he was in a spiritual body, but he remembered his previous life and explained it to Vyasadeva. In material life there is forgetfulness, but in spiritual life there is no forgetfulness. I hope this will sufficiently answer these questions for you.

Please convey my blessings to your family. I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
