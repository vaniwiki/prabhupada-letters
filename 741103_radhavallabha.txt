Dear Radhavallabha Prabhu:

Please accept my humble obeisances. your letter addressed to Nitai Prabhu dated 25/10/74 has been brought to Srila Prabhupada's attention. Regarding book production, Srila Prabhupada is most concerned that you finish C.C. Ādi:1 as soon as you can and at least by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura's disappearance day as you have anticipated.

Regarding the indexing for Srimad-Bhagavatam, that has caused some confusion. From you letter it appears that you are printing a one volume index covering the first four Cantos, in a softcover edition. But, the indexes for the First and Second Cantos have already been published at the concluding volume of the Canto. Why are you now changing the procedure? Since the indexes for the first two Cantos have already appeared, why not just publish indexes for the next two Cantos which have not yet appeared? And, even if you bring out indexes for all the first four Cantos, since the entire work is not yet completed, you will again have to do the work over again when the succeeding Cantos are published.

Anyway you can do it as you are doing it, but it is advisable to consult directly with Srila Prabhupada on such a matter specially if you are making some change in any of the publishing, that should be consulted with Srila Prabhupada first. Kindly do this.

Prabhupada is expected to remain in Bombay for one month so that the samples of the newly printed books may be sent here.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your servant,\\
Brahmananda Swami\\
Personal Secretary
