My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 23rd, 1969 with enclosures. I shall keep the letter of Mr. Manu Vora in my file. The composition which you have sent me, although it is incomplete, it appears to be nice. I do not find any mistake in the composition, but sometimes you have spelled Caitanya as Caitanya, and sometimes you have spelled it Caitanya. so why there should be two different spellings? On page #3 you will find this difference. Otherwise, I do not find any difficulty. Regarding __Isopanisad,__ I have no books here with me, so I cannot actually refer to the book what is Mantra #9. This is the difficulty of editorial work. I do not know in the absence of the book how I can help you. But the way of English synonyms given by you on page #3, under heading "Sri Isopanisad English Synonyms, Invocation and Mantras I-V" is set up very nicely. If you follow this principle throughout in all our books, it will be very, very nice, super-excellent work. But if you sometimes refer me on my touring program, it will be difficult for me. Of course, after my return from Europe I am sitting down tight for book work, and then it will not be very difficult job for me if you refer any sentence for correction. In the meantime, I think you are doing nicely. Just pray Krishna and do your best.

So far as your family life is concerned, the description given by you is nice. You should always remember that sex life should be avoided as far as possible, and simply it can be utilized for begetting Krishna conscious children. So you are all grown up boys and girls, advanced also in Krishna Consciousness; so you will do the necessary thing even without consulting me. Regarding the pages of __Nectar of Devotion__ which were sent to you from Germany, it may be delayed so you will have to wait for some days. It was sent by registered mail, so I am hoping it is not lost. When you receive it, please let me know. Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. In every page the name of the book over the left page and the subject matter on the head of the right page must be mentioned.
