My dear Prajapati das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 8, 1975 and have noted the contents. You can come to the Mayapur festival and stay until the Vrndavana festival if possible. In between the two festival, we will be trying to arrange other large programs in South India (Madras and Hyderabad), so, there will be a nice program for all the devotees. You don't have to worry so much about recruiting new people. Just work nicely with the dancers you have now. Make full utilization of the facilities that you already have. Regarding your plane fare to India, it will be best if you can collect that money by selling some books on sankirtana. Then there will be no shortage.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
