My dear Revatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 3/10/72, and I am very much pleased upon you for taking up the matter of preaching work in England especially, and also other places. I am happy to hear that new centers are being opened by you and others in Europe. This is our best field, and practically I am observing here in Australia that you western boys and girls are becoming angels by taking up this Krishna Consciousness process, and that our Indian boys and girls will not take it up. They think that to have a good wife and sufficient income, bas, that is the goal of their life. But you all are joining me and you are coming out very nicely by Krishna's grace, so I am very much thankful. One thing, if we are not very careful to always stick to the point of regulative principles and purest standards of high living, then everything will spoil very quickly and the whole show will be a farce. So impress this point in your preaching for training the younger devotees, they will follow your example in all respects.

I think your idea to canvass the youth groups and colleges in England is good proposal, so do it nicely in cooperation with Dayananda and the others there, and I am sending Kesava there to England soon to organize the book-distribution and travelling Sankirtana Party, so you know him, now you help him very seriously to increase these two programs, because I think especially that England is the best field in the world for distributing our books, as good or better than USA, so I want that you all should be very active to increase the scope there. Kesava is the recognized expert in these fields, so you take direction from him how to do it, and you preach wherever you go throughout the British Isles, and make this travelling SKP a great success, a greater success, than it is now in your country.

Regarding your questions, 1) The devotee __always__ takes bodily pains as the mercy of Krishna. 2) Everyone who is chanting Hare Krishna is getting benefit. Sanatana Goswami says that one should not hear from an aVaisnava, or non-Vaisnava. So people who are imitating are hearing from a Vaisnava. They are not a Vaisnava, because the Hare Krishna Mantra is introduced by us only into the western world, so whatever they have heard is from a Vaisnava.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy spirits.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
