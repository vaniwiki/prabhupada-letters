Dear Prabhus,

Please accept my humble obeisances. All Glories to His Divine Grace, Srila Prabhupad. It has come to our notice that one Godbrother of Srila Prabhupad’s, Swami Bon Maharaj, has been spreading damaging propaganda against Srila Prabhupad and against our movement. Satsvarupa Maharaj recently informed Srila Prabhupad that one Professor in Canada refused to take a standing order of Srila Prabhupad’s books because he associated with Swami Bon at his Oriental Institute in Vrindaban, and Swami Bon so much made untrue accusations against our beloved Spiritual Master Srila Prabhupad. Swami Bon recently made a tour of Canada and Satsvarup Maharaj reported that his statements were “poisonous, saying many false things about Krsna consciousness.” Recently, one professor, Dr. Hines, of Indian Religious Studies at Yale marked: “I think Swami Bon is just jealous of Srila Prabhupad.”

Under the circumstances, we shall __fully__ non-cooperate with this Swami Bon and neither we shall form any kind of association with any person whose aim it is to blaspheme the Lord or his pure devotee.

I hope that this meets you all in blissful serving mood,

Your unworthy servant,

Pusta Krsna Swami

Acting Secretary for

Srila Prabhupad
