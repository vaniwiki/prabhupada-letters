====== Letter to: G.L. Nanda ======

Sriman Gulzari Lal Nanda\\
5, Tuglak Road,\\
New Delhi 110011

Krishna Balarama Temple, \\
Rama Reti, Vrindaban (U.P.)

My Dear Sriman Nandaji, 

Please accept my greetings. After seeing the whole situation I've decided like this. Let us immediately construct a nice gorgeous temple on the spot which you have earmarked for constructing the Radha Krishna Temple. I think the land is measuring about 10 acres. If you allow me to construct the temple on this spot, I can take up the work immediately without a moment's delay. Later on when the construction is completed the cost may be exchanged by giving me a land suitable for constructing a Varnashram college. The idea is that the temple construction on the land earmarked by you is overdue, therefore I wish to take up the work immediately.

I hope you will favorably decide.

Your sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
