Krishna Balarama Temple, \\
Rama Reti, Vrindaban (U.P.)

My Dear Sriman Nandaji, 

Please accept my greetings. After seeing the whole situation I've decided like this. Let us immediately construct a nice gorgeous temple on the spot which you have earmarked for constructing the Radha Krishna Temple. I think the land is measuring about 10 acres. If you allow me to construct the temple on this spot, I can take up the work immediately without a moment's delay. Later on when the construction is completed the cost may be exchanged by giving me a land suitable for constructing a Varnashram college. The idea is that the temple construction on the land earmarked by you is overdue, therefore I wish to take up the work immediately.

I hope you will favorably decide.

Your sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
