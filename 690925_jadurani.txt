My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated September 16, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased to note that the Boston temple is going on nicely and you are working very steadily at your painting work. Regarding Barunadev, he is a very beautiful demigod in the form of a man. He has a beautiful body nice clothe, helmet, ornaments. So you may paint him in that way. Regarding pictures from __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ if you have enough time, I can suggest so many pictures; but for the time being you are engaged in pictures for __Krishna.__ That is also __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ First let these pictures be finished nicely. Make them as nice as possible, and then later on you can do pictures for our other books. Regarding the relative importance of painting and temple kirtanas for you, the painting is more important. Paint and chant Hare Krishna, that is the most important engagement for you. I have received a letter from Satsvarupa in which he inquired if he may print some of the __Krishna__ book in __BTG.__ Please inform him that this is a nice idea and he may do it.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
