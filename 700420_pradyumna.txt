My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received the blueprint copy of __KRSNA, the Reservoir of Pleasure__ and I have begun to read it through. But I notice that there are some points you should correct before the final printing. I have already noted you the injunction that you should change the pretipadika artha to first case ending instead. Sannyasin should be printed Sannyasi, etc. So please correct these.

Another point is that there are some errors in the English also. On page 2 it should read ". . . decided to kill his sister, Devaki." but it has become sisters, plural. Then, what does it mean?: "The Lord's compromise was that He had Vasudeva propose . . ." This does not seem to be very clear or at least it is very awkward expression. So please see that the editors make a very careful final proofreading before printing the final copies.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
