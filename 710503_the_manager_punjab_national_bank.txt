Dear Sir,

This day I have taken a fixed deposit a/c No. 1146/228/ [indistinct] for a sum of Rs. 1,30,000/- from your office for a period of 61 months. I request you that the interest accrued on the fixed deposit be credited to my savings fund A/c No. 2595 after the close of every 1/2 year. For this purpose, I am leaving the above-said fixed deposit with you.

Yours faithfully,\\
