====== Letter to: Edward ======

New York

My dear Edward,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 31-1-76 which has only now reached me here in Bombay.

It is difficult to send things through the mail, so better if you go to our New York temple for getting prasadam. Krishna is absolute so prasadam offered in our temple in New York is as good and the same as the prasadam from here. I am glad that you are enjoying chanting "Hare Krishna" and reading my books. You and your wife should continue with this process and try to attend our temple as often as possible and gradually you will come to Krishna consciousness.

Hoping this finds you both well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
