My dear Yasasvini devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your very nice offering and I thank you very much for it. Pleasing the spiritual master is the most important principle in spiritual life so go on acting in such a way that the spiritual master may be pleased. Always chant at least 16 rounds daily and follow the four principles without fail. Then you will be strong in your spiritual life. By always following the principles, chanting, and performing regulated worship of the Deity, one can make steady advancement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
