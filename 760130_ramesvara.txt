My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings.

Enclosed please find a conversation between Dhrstadyumna das and a Professor Verdu of the University of Kansas. It was a television program as you can see from the enclosed photos. The professor has very much appreciated the discussion and he has written that he will now teach a course with special attention to the teachings of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This conversation can be published as a small pamphlet similar to the one published originally as the "Vedic Way". The photos can be used for the front and back covers. The letter from the Prof. Mr. Verdu, can also be included. You can also include some reviews from important professors on Caitanya-caritamrta. There should be an advertisement for Caitanya-caritamrta 1st Part %%_%% pp.; 2nd Part %%_%% pp.; 3rd Part %%_%% pp.; Complete %%_%% pp. It should be printed so that Temples can give to persons who offer small donations, even too small to give a BTG to. It will also impress all intelligent people, that our students can present our philosophy so nicely and authoritatively.

Now work is proceedingly full scale here on the new residential building and in Bombay work is beginning under the guidance of Larson and Tubrow. So Rs. 7 Lakhs will be required immediately this month for Bombay. In your BBT Trustees report you say that $200,000. has been put in fixed deposit for one month. That one month is now over so you can immediately transfer $100,000. to the Bombay Bank of America account. The balance can be put on fixed deposit for another month and transferred to B. of America Bombay in the beginning of March when it matures.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
