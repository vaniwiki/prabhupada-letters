My dear Gatravan das;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and have noted the contents. I do not know why you are bringing this matter to my attention. I have appointed Rupanuga das as my GBC to take care of these matters. Do not bother my brain. I cannot understand what has gone on but I simply request you to return to the temple and take part in the activities. In addition you should chant Hare Krishna and read my books and cooperate with the authorities. If you engage yourself full time in preaching then there won't be any other time for these other activities. You should approach the other Vaisnavas in a very humble state of mind.

Do not be puffed up but always be more tolerant than the tree. This is the prescription given by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
