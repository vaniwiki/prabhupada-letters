My dear Nayana Bhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received one unaccompanied cheque for $100 return addressed to your Philadelphia center. So I beg to thank you very much for this contribution which I think must be a gift for Vyasa Puja Day presentation and I have deposited it with Dai Nippon for publication of our literatures.

Please offer my blessings to all the other devotees there. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
