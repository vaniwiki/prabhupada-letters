Dear Mr. Mittra,

I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 5, 1968, and have noted the contents. I cannot follow exactly what the account is; and a few days ago the president, Brahmananda, came to see me, and I understand that he is regularly corresponding with you about the statement of account and other things. So I am busy in my propaganda work and I cannot just divert my attention in this account business. So far the 15 cases of books, I have several times submitted the invoices and each time they are rejected. So I am fed up with this business. The best thing is that you kindly send me a copy of the invoice as you desire to be made and then I shall make as it is, and send it to you immediately. Otherwise, my brain does not act how to make the invoice which will satisfy all concerned.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
