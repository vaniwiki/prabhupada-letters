My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated May 12, 1972, and have noted the contents. I am encouraged to hear that you are prepared to take sannyas and travel widely for GBC's real business. I am thinking to go to Mexico City by end of this month or first of June, and we shall stay there for one week, and, as you have invited me to come there several times, I am thinking to return to Los Angeles by way of Dallas. I can stay in Dallas for several days, so you can arrange like that. We shall discuss more at that time.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
