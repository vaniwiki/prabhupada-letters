====== Letter to: Gaura Govinda ======

My dear Gaura Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 30/11/76.

Yes, as soon as we get electricity, the sooner it will be fit for my coming there. For my translation work I require electricity. I am going to Wardha on the 17th. Find out the travel arrangements from Wardha to Bhuvaneśvara. Whether there is a direct railway line? Or are there airplane flights from Nagpur to Bhuvaneśvara?

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have just now received your letter dated 8/12/76. You may come to meet me in Hyderabad before the 17th or come to Bombay by the 22nd December 1976.\\
