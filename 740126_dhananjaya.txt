Rome

Dear Dhananjaya,

Please accept my blessings. I'm so glad to receive your Special Delivery mail containing BTG. I am so glad to see you have given another step forward in our activity of pushing on the Krsna Consciousness movement. Rome is certainly a very important place in Europe. Big, big headquarters of the Christian world headed by the Pope. The people are naturally religiously inclined there, and I am sure if our movement is properly organized there, surely we shall get many devotees. Please try to remain there and go on propagating Krsna Consciousness as far as possible. My special thanks to you because you have immediately published the magazine.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

I hope you are going to Mayapur also.\\
