My dear Yasodanandana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22 March, 1976 and I have noted the contents carefully. My program will be confirmed by the end of April. There is a proposed meeting with the chief minister of Haryana for organizing Kuruksetra and if that meeting is serious, then certainly I shall remain in India. The minister is supposed to meet me in Vrindaban before the 10th April and after the meeting I shall let you know my program.

Concerning the story of Prahlada (Varaha Nrsimha), if the story is mentioned in the Puranas then it is alright. I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
