Dear Sir:

Re: __My H.S.B. Account No. 14538 with You.__

I beg to inform you that I am travelling all over the country and whenever there is some collection I transfer the money by mail transfer. I had no difficulty anywhere, but here in Gorakhpur it is the first time that a branch has charged for the transfer. Previous to this they did not charge. Neither in Surat, Amritsar, Allahabad, Indore, etc. did they charge for my mail transfer.

So kindly issue a letter in my favor that your branches should not charge for my mail transfer.

Also, kindly let me know what is the balance in my favor in the above account. I have just transferred Rs. 1611.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
