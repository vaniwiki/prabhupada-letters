My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I have advised Brahmananda to give you loan of $500.00 from the funds which are set aside by Brahmananda for publication of my books. The condition is that as promised by you, you must return the money by monthly installments of $100.00. Please be always strongly fixed up in the Lotus Feet of Krishna, just as the bees are fixed up in the honeycomb. This staunch affection for Krishna will save us from all kinds of dangers created by Maya. You know it very well that the material energy is so strong that it captivates the spiritual spark, living entity and the only remedy is to cling to the Lotus Feet of Krishna. This age is especially meant for dissension, therefore whenever there is such occasion we should simply call for for the help of Krishna. Our task is very heavy because we have declared was against Maya. She will always try to defeat us or even kill us but we can always be saved by clinging unto the Lotus Feet of Krishna. Kindly remember this secret of our success and try to convince all your God-brothers on this point. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta, Swami
