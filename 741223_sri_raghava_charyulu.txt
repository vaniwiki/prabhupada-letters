Dear Sri Raghava Charyulu,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7th Nov, 1974 addressed to my Los Angeles headquarters. I was so much pleased with your interesting letter and I wish you will understand more and more through your learning of mathematics and physics about the intricacies of God's creation. It is the duty of a learned scholar to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his talent of knowledge, austerity, penance, etc. Why one should become great mathematician? What is the perfectional stage? That stage is when he describes the glories of the Lord by utilization of his talent of education. So I request you to observe more and more the cosmic manifestation; how it is created by the energy of the Supreme Lord. Actually by the evolutionary process when a living entity comes to the status of human life it is his duty to solve all the problems of life. The chief problems of life are collectively birth, death, old age and disease. __Bhagavad-gita__ gives information how to solve these four problems. It is the essence of all Vedic knowledge presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. I am so glad to learn that you have taken so much interest in my book, __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ I shall be staying in Bombay up till mid-Jan. and I wish to cordially invite you to see me at your convenience. Generally I can be seen between 5 and 7 p.m. Thank you once more for your interesting letter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
