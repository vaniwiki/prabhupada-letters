My dear Satsvarupa das Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 26, 1974 and your Vyasa Puja Offering. It is very encouraging that many professors have purchased books for themselves and are considering to order them for their students. I very much like this program of the standing orders. Try to increase it up to 50,000 such orders from the libraries. I have written to Bali Mardan Goswami in this connection. Regarding the remark that distributing a book to a professor is 100 times better than to a ordinary man, I never said that. I said it was very important.

Regarding your suggestion for a book especially for use in college courses, if possible you can pick it up from my other books, articles and speeches. You have the idea, so you can do it, just suitable for them.

It is all right with me if you manage the Central Zone and also the library party. There is no need for you to come to Vrindaban for the festival.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
