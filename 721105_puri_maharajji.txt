(after Nov. 15th: c/o Hariprasad Badruka,

Ghasiram Building,

Mahbub Ganj,

Hyderabad, A. P., India)

My dear Puri Maharajji,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your letter dated October 26, 1972, which has reached me here at Vrindaban. Yes, the programme is going on very nicely, and all the devotees are enlivened by our discourses daily in morning and evening in the Samadhi courtyard at Radha-Damodar temple. I can understand that due to so many celebrations at this Urja time you are unable to join me here.

Now after Urja you will go to Puri for again trying for that place, but now there is competition, so how we can stop it? But if you offer them the right price, and if we try to get it very seriously we shall be able to do it, by Krishna’s grace. So if you need any help from me in this connection, I am here in India, so I am at your service to do the needful and secure Srila Prabhupad’s birth-site.

Soon we are going to Hyderabad, and by December 1st we shall reach Ahmedabad and Bombay. I think by January 10th I shall be in Calcutta, and I may see you then.

Meanwhile I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Sri B.V. Puri Maharaj,

n.b. I think Hyderabad is not so far from you, so whether you can meet me there? Then we shall discuss going to Puri and other things.
