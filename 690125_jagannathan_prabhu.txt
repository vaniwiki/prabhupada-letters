My dear Jagannathan Prabhu,

Please accept my humble obeisances. I beg to thank you very much for your sending me the copies of your books %%____%% and your letter dated January 20, 1969. I have noted the contents very carefully. I have immediately upon receipt handed over the books to my editorial assistants, and I shall duly inform you about their opinion for publishing them in this country. I think it may take at least one month to let you know their decision. I have received news from Vancouver that our godbrother Sadanandaji Swami (formerly brahmacari Earnest Schulze) who is in Germany now has enquired from a friend about my address, and he wants to meet my disciples in our German Hamburg center. I do not know his address, but I am expecting his letter very soon. When I hear from him I shall let you know.

My sister from Calcutta has addressed me one letter that she has heard by some source that I am coming to Mayapur during the great festival. This means that some of our godbrothers and sisters may be expecting me during the ensuing festival there. But till now I have heard no news from Tirtha Maharaja.

Hoping this will meet you in good health. Thanking you once more for your letter and books.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: The set of books may also be sent to Brahmananda das Brahmacari c/o International Society for Krishna Consciousness, 61 Second Avenue, New York, NY 10003
