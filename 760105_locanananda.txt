My dear Locanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 31, 1976 and have noted the contents carefully.

Your Deities shall be named Radha Gopinatha. Your report is very encouraging about book printing. The more we distribute books our mission becomes solidified.

Yes, we should always remember following the regulative principles and reading our books. That will give us spiritual strength.

Upon your recommendation I am pleased to accept as my initiated disciples: First initiation; Mr. Claude Nowe---Klesapaha-dasa, Bert de Vos---Vrsnivamsa-dasa, Belgin Kaya---Vedasmrit-dasi, and Maria Eugenia Jorquera---Marutvati-dasi; Second initiation; Jaya Gopala dasa, Janaraja dasa, Aharadi dasa. Now, hold a fire sacrifice and instruct the devotees to follow strictly the regulative principles and always chant a minimum of 16 rounds. Let Bhagavan dasa chant on their beads. Play the tape of me chanting Gayatri into the right ears of the second initiates and teach them how to count on their finger divisions.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
