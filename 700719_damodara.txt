My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings for yourself and your good wife, Mrganetridevi Dasi. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 13rd July, 197-0, and I am so glad to know that you are now happily married by Subala at a nice ceremony in Philadelphia.

You were for some time feeling agitation and now Krsna has blessed you with a very nice, qualified wife who is an enthusiastic devotee as well. Please both of you husband and wife work now conjointly in full Krsna consciousness for spreading Lord Caitanya's message. You are very intelligent boy, good devotee and good preacher with good experience also. Your wife and you are good match, so take up this work of spreading Krsna consciousness very seriously and make your both lives sublime and Krsna will certainly give you all intelligence how to advance in His service. Please take advantage of this opportunity and utilize your lives for the transcendental loving service of the Lord and be happy chanting Hare Krsna mantra, dancing, distributing Prasadam and literatures, and preaching Krsna consciousness as your life and soul.

Hope this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
