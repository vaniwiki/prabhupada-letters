My dear Tamala Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter addressed to Brahmananda Maharaja complaining that Madhudvisa Maharaja in Bombay is not cooperating. The books are very urgently required here because we have made about 35 members and none of them have been supplied with any books. Every day they are asking for books and this is not very good for us. Brahmananda also showed me the copies of the correspondence with Bombay since the beginning of August and still the books are not arrived. So please do the needful. Why this is happening? I have also sent one note to Madhudvisa Maharaja in this connection.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
