====== Letter to: Dayananda ======

Dallas Gurukula

Dear Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received you written note of 3/8/74 with names for initiation. I have accepted the devotees named by you as my disciples and their spiritual names are as follows

Sherry---Syamalangi devi

Debbie---Dyuti devi

Gary---Giri dasa

It is very pleasing to me to accept also some of our older Gurukula students who you have recommended as ready for initiation. Ekendra das Brahmacari and Dvarakadhisa dasa Brahmacari have already been given their spiritual names by me. Catton---Katyayana das Brahmacari, and Lisa---Manisa devi, are also now initiated devotees. All initiated devotees must chant at least 16 rounds daily, without fail. Now that they are initiated there is no question of not doing their rounds. You may hold a fire yajna and Jagadisa Prabhu may chant on their beads. In court when a person swears to tell the truth he can be punished by perjury if he does not take it seriously and tells a lie, so those who will promise before the deity to follow the rules and regulations of initiated disciples will be punished if they fail to do so. I am certain, however, that under your able guidance all the boys and girls are enthusiastic in their duties for Krsna.

I have received your recommendation for second initiation for Ram Gopala and Baladeva. das Brahmacaris. I am enclosing sacred thread for them as well as gayatri. Have them hear the tape of me chanting gayatri through the right ear. I will be pleased to hear your latest reports from Gurukula.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
