My dear Lilasukha Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. Your letter of Nov. 26, 1967, received along with your beads. I have sanctified your beads last evening when I initiated two other boys Cidananda and Krishna das. I am very glad to know that you are realizing Krishna Consciousness. The more you chant, the more you will realize.

I think Krishna has brought me again in your country for the purpose of training you perfectly. One must be educated. The education may be taken either in schools or privately but one must be educated. We want many preachers to broadcast this message Krishna Consciousness. Without education we cannot preach because a preacher has to meet many kinds of opposite elements. One has to be engaged in one's specific occupation and at the same time to advance in Krishna Consciousness. Herewith please find your beads. Get some Small Beads to be fixed up in your neck. Have regularly the Tilaka marks. Brahmananda will assist you in all details. Be happy in Krishna Consciousness. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
