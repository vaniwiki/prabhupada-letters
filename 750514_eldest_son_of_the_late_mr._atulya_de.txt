My dear son,

Please accept my blessings. I wanted to see you very urgently to know about your family affairs. So, will you kindly give me your exact name and address so that I can arrange to see you? When I was grhastha, I had visited your home two or three times. Now, I am a sannyasi. My headquarters is #3 Albert Road, Calcutta-17. So, it will be very kind of you to write me at this address in Calcutta how I can see you.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
