My dear Sons and Daughter,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Traidas I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. I have chanted on your beads and they are enclosed herewith. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Jeffrey Balawajder/JANAJANMADIH DASA\\
Alann Hayes/ANADIH DASA\\
Auda Gen/ARAUDRA DASI

Now my request to all of you is that you very seriously stick to the principles of devotional service, following especially the four principle restrictions, and without fail always chant at least 16 rounds on your beads daily, and be happy.

You have got now the golden opportunity of this human form of life, and it is not accident that you have got your spiritual master, so take advantage by following always in his footsteps and very quickly you will attain the supreme perfection of your life. That is done by trying always to please your spiritual master, being engaged 24 hours in Krishna's business of spreading this Krishna Consciousness Movement all over the world, helping me however best you are able to do it according to your individual capacity. Then you will be freed from maya's clutches and go with me back to home, back to Godhead.

Hoping this meets all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
