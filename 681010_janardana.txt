My dear Janardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am surprised that since I have come back from Montreal I have not heard anything from you. Why you are silent? Please reply this letter immediately because I am very much anxious to hear from you. Are you doing French translation work of our books? What about the program of French publication of Back To Godhead? I wrote you from San Francisco, but I have not heard any reply from you. Please take care of this business with the American Consulate, as you will find described in Hansadutta's letter, as soon as possible. Hoping you are well, and convey my blessings to Muna, hoping that she also is in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
