Dear Bhagavat Ashraya,

Please accept my blessings. I have received, by hand delivery of devotees from Delhi, your letter making recommendations for brahminical initiation. I therefore accept the following devotees:

Syamasundari devi dasi\\
Chandra Lila devi dasi

Give them gayatri mantra by hearing me speak it on the tape through the right ear. Instruct them in the standards of cleanliness and brahminical life.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
