My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 16, 1972 and I am so much pleased to read the contents. The newspaper clipping sent by you is very much encouraging. I am starting for Australia on the morning of March 31, and I wanted to see Giriraja before my starting. So kindly send him upon receipt of this letter if he has not already started. The report that Hindus and Muslims are taking prasadam together is very encouraging. Please continue this program. All the Muslims in Mayapur have now become very friendly towards us. For the last 50 years our Godbrothers were there but they could not make arrangements for the Hindus and Muslims to take prasadam together. The picture is very attractive, and is fitting %%___%% devotees. I am so pleased that Tamala Krishna Goswami is working so %%___%% hard, so combinedly you do the project together quite successfully. That will please my Guru Maharaja and me also.

Kindly send the reports at least twice in a month to whatever center I may be staying.

We have gotten an invitation from Bangladesh from my Godbrother, His Holiness Bhakti Sambandha Turya Swami Maharaja, Sri Gaudiya Math, P.O. Bordia, District Jessore. If possible you can make some program for Tamala Krishna Goswami's party to go there at our own expense. He is now a ruined man so if possible we can utilize his center as our branch.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
