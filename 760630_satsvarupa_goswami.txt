My dear Satsvarupa Goswami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 28, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

We are concerned with service. What is the meaning of the post, that is, president, secretary, etc., etc. I am glad to see that Govardhana is doing nicely. I have confidence that things will go on nicely there, but he should be encouraged to faithfully follow the rules and regulations and chant 16 rounds daily.

Why was Gaura-Nitai and Radha-Krsna Deities put on the Ratha cart in Chicago? Who has sanctioned this? This is not authorized. It does not mean that we shall make Rathayatra a conglomeration. Everything should be done by proper sanction.

Concerning the installation of Deities of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Maharaja Prabhupada and myself, you have my permission to have them for the Chicago temple.

With regard to your question about Bengali style kirtana and mrdanga playing, one or two styles is best. To introduce more styles is not good. It will become an encumbrance. Who is that Krsna das Babaji who is teaching? If we introduce so much emphasis on style of kirtana, then simply imitation will go on. Devotional emotion is the main thing. If we give stress to instrument and style then attention will be diverted to the style. That will be spiritual loss.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
