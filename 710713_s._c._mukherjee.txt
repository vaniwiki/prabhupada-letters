====== Letter to: S. C. Mukherjee ======

Sri S.C. Mukherjee\\
B/2 Kiron Sankara Roy Road\\
Calcutta-1

My dear Sri Mukherjee,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2nd July, 1971 and have noted the contents. Presently I am out of Calcutta. So it is better if you are still interested in our Mayapur project to see the Mayapur committee and speak with them at our temple at 3, Albert Road; Calcutta-17. The committee is in charge of all these affairs and if they are in need of your service, that will be very nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
