My dear Annada devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 20, 1974 and am pleased to hear that you are well. When I was in Delhi I was sorry to learn that you were ill, so I immediately informed your husband that you must be cared for. Anyway we have to depend upon Krishna in all circumstances. As long as the body is there there will be different degrees of health and unhealth. We have to tolerate these things just as we have to tolerate the seasonal changes of sometimes hot sometimes cold.

You are a devotee, and so Krishna will protect you. Always think that Krishna is with you. He is present in His name, so you are always associating with Him.

I Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
