My dear Bahudak,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated December 15th, 1975 and I have noted the contents carefully.

I was very glad to learn how our devotees are coming out victorious in the preaching to the university professors and students. Other groups have no philosophy nor do they have any idea of spiritual life, what to speak of living it. Our movement is authorized. Our books are based on the statements of the most exalted devotees. And if we follow strictly the guidelines for devotional service as they are given in the Nectar of Devotion and Nectar of Instruction, then no one can touch us. Our position is definitely due to our books, therefore I am always pressing on this point. All the groups are declining including the Christians. We are being harassed by the authorities and they are all Christians. Because they are losing ground, and we are increasing, they are trying to stop us. There is always this battle between the demons and the devotees, but the devotees always win because they are protected by Krishna.

It is good that you are again the President of the Vancouver temple. Of course the farm projects are important but more stress should be given to Sankirtana. We require so much money here in India. So Jayatirtha has said right. Whatever we are doing in India is from the BBT fund. Continue to go out on Sankirtana. Example is better than precept.

The harmonium may be played during bhajan if there is someone who can play melodiously. But it is not for kirtana and arati.

All of the devotees you have recommended I accept for initiation. Dharmarupa das, Subavrata dasi, Mahojjvala dasi, Sthanur das, Jagadadija das, Damagosh das and Kanti-mati should after holding a fire ceremony, be allowed to hear the Gayatri mantra through the right ear from the tape recording. They must always keep clean, internally by chanting the Lord's glories, and externally by regular bathing. In addition they should regularly study Bhagavad-gita, Nectar of Devotion, Nectar of Instruction, Isopanisad and all the paperbacks because soon we shall be holding examinations based on these books for the brahmanas. Those who pass will be given the title Bhakti-sastri. Gail Bergeron's spiritual name is Paratpara dasi. She that she chants minimum 16 rounds daily and strictly follows the regulative principles.

I hope this meets you and all the devotees there well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
