My dear Niranjana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3rd August 1976 and have noted the contents with care. Thank you very much for your concern. I have gotten much better. The opening of the temple in Hyderabad was very successful.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b.---Your idea of putting the disassociated sloka below the original is not good. Do not do it. The Hari-bhakti-vilasa in Hindi is not very important. Neither is the chart of Lord Caitanya's activities, but you can keep it for future reference.\\
