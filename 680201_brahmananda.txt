My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter of 1/29/68. Yes, I very much approve of Mr. Kallman's idea for the book on "Transcendental Meditation." Rayarama has begun work on it already, and probably he will bring it back to N.Y. with him. Mukunda talked to Ravi Sankara and he said he is too busy with recordings and movies, etc.

The specimens of paper are all nice, any one of them will be suitable. But I prefer the 70 or 60 lb. Your letter to Village Voice is very nice, and is written right to the point. I have made an Istagosthi file, and I shall go on putting the reports there as you send them.

Lord Jagannatha is one feature of Krishna as so many features, as Lord Narayana. Jagat means universe, and natha means Lord, the Lord of the Universe.

Today I have received one urgent letter from Acyutananda Brahmacari. He is doing very nicely with preaching work at Kanpur. He has held many seminars, at different places, and the educated circle (lawyers, teachers, etc.) are taking part in his preaching work. Kanpur is the next important city after Calcutta and Bombay. Therefore his decision to start immediately one center at Kanpur is acceptable. As proposed previously, $10 from each center should be contributed for the Indian American House. Now, you can immediately sent him at the following address $100 from the book account. And for the next month we shall arrange to send him $60, collected from each center $10. He is requesting me to send you, Rayarama, and Rupanuga for sometime there for preaching work. Rayarama has already sent him a note that he may be going there, latest by April 1968. You had the program to go to India for some time, now you can arrange for your starting there. Kanpur is very important center, and there are many big business magnets, and 4 or 5 Brahmacaris staying there for sometime and preaching this mission will carry good effect. The bank should be advised to transfer $100 by air mail to the following address; Acyutananda das Brahmacari, c/o N. Banerjea, 114 Elliot Road, Kanpur 4, India.

Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
