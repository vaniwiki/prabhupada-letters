====== Letter to: Sucandra ======

Munich

My dear Sucandra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 17, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I am very glad to know that you are working sincerely to distribute this great science to the people of Germany. Not only the people in Germany, but all over the world, people are suffering due to lack of this knowledge. When the son is suffering, the father is also afflicted. So Krishna, the Supreme Father, does not like to see his parts and parcels suffering in the material world. To deliver the fallen souls, He gives His instruction, He sends His representatives, and sometimes He even comes Himself just for the benefit of all the living entities. So it is our duty, as His representative, to canvass. "Please take this knowledge and make your life successful." So all of you continue to push on this movement with ever-increasing enthusiasm, and Krishna will help you.

So far your daughter, there is already one devotee named Visakha, so instead your daughter may be named Vaisnavi Dasi.

Hoping this meets you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
