My dear Paramananda,

Please accept my blessings. I was so pleased to receive your letter of December 8, 1968 and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. Such attitude of humbleness which you have so nicely expressed along with your very good service attitude is very beautiful and will take you far to advance more and more.

I am happy that you and your very good wife, Satyabhama, are finding such satisfaction in executing your Krishna Consciousness activities and such pleasure will only increase more and more as you continue to advance further. This is my blessing upon you both that your lives may become happy and successful. So my one request to you is that you keep yourself always engaged in Krishna's service sincerely and that you help your wife in this matter also. Now there is enough engagement with popularizing our books and magazines so you will have enough work to utilize all of your time in this important endeavor. You are strong, intelligent boy so there is so much of such service that you can render and be a great asset to this Krishna Consciousness movement.

In the future there may be facilities to start schooling in our New Vrindaban and when this is begun I think that Satyabhama and yourself may consider to go there to teach and assist with the work going on there. So as Krishna desires we will see what happens.

Please convey my blessings to all others and I hope that you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
