My dear Sukadeva dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 12, 1974 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I am accepting David Kiish as my disciple. His spiritual name is Damaghosa dasa. I am also accepting Abhinanda dasa Brahmacari for second initiation. Enclosed is his sanctified sacred thread and mantra sheet. Hold a fire sacrifice amongst the devotees and he can hear the mantra from my tape record through the right ear. For chanting on the beads, a sannyasi or GBC man can do it.

Regarding your question that if I have ever said that the Society authorities must suffer for the devotees under their protection, no, I never said that.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
