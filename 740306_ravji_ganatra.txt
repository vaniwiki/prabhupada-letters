Dear Ravji Ganatra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 23, 1974, and I have noted the contents.

Since you have gone we have not gone an inch forward. They have gone and made application for the police commissioner to give sanction, but it is still lying there and they do not say yes or no. There is no sanction as yet. Our position is not clear. I require your help very much. Things are standing in the same position as when you left.

I was in Bombay myself for 10 to 12 days. Now I am here in Mayapur on account of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's birthday anniversary. I arrived here March 1st. By the end of March I will be again in Bombay, and by that time you will come back and help us in this matter. More when we meet. Thanking you for your kind attention,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
