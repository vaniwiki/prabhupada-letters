My Dear Shyamadasi, 

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to receive your letter dated 5th April, 1970. Next summer, if your child delivery is complete by that time, I invite you to come here at that time and stay in this new temple along with other devotees and see how things are going on here. This church is very nice and commodious. We have got lecture hall separate, temple hall separate, my two storied residential quarter separate, and brahmacary and brahmacarini quarters separate, householders quarter separate. Besides that there is extra land for developing a nice green house and parking motor cars.

So I am glad that you are typing the remaining portion of KRSNA, and then I shall send the second part of KRSNA also for editing. Your husband wanted from me a specific duty, and I think the best part of his valor can be utilized in editorial work. There is ample work for his engagement and your assistance for him, so combined together you fully engage yourself in this service of Krsna and please come here.

I shall ask you to make some good chapaties for me. This will be an extra duty for you besides your typewriting work.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
