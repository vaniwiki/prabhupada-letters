My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. After receiving your letter of April 12, 1974, I sent you a telegram requesting you as follows: "Come immediately to Bombay. Everything is all right. Krsna will bless you." But I have received no word from you as yet. If you are not coming to India please let me know what your program will be.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
