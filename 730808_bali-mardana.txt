My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your books which I find very very nice. Actually this book production is most important, and you have pleased me very much. Just go on and flood the whole world with these Krsna books.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Has Mukunda done any business? If not then this business has no ready buyer and thus it has no prospect, that is my opinion. I understand that you are coming during the Janmastami Festival here at this place. ACBS
