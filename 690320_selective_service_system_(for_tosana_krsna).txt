RE: THOMAS GRITTON ALLIN III 4-40-50-437 (TOSAN KRISHNA DAS BRAHMACHARY)

THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT THOMAS GRITTON ALLIN III (TOSAN KRISHNA DAS BRAHMACHARY) is my bona fide initiated student. He is being trained under me to become an ordained Minister of Religion in the KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS (God Consciousness) SOCIETY, and he is studying regularly the following books: (1) __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ (2) __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ (3) __The Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ and other allied literatures. He is also preaching this perfect religious process amongst university students.

MY INITIATED STUDENTS ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO INDULGE in the following principles of degradation: (1) All forms of intoxication, including coffee, tea, cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, etc. (2) The eating of animal foods, such as meat, fish, and eggs. Rather, their diet consists of Prasadam, especially offered foodstuffs (vegetarian), (3) Unmarried sex indulgence, (4) Gambling, or idle sports of any sort. Their lives are dedicated to serving God, and as such, they have no time to squander on unbeneficial activities or non-Godly activities.

SOME OF MY STUDENTS HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED IN THE 4D CLASS or Ministerial Order prior to this by the Selective Service System.
