My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28th July, 1970.

Krsna can expand Himself in various ways with His different wives. You are not only advanced student in painting, but also in Krsna consciousness, so always pray to Krsna how you shall draw the painting and I think it will come out nice. My another request to you is that because I am going to the Eastern hemisphere countries I wish to establish as many branches as possible on that side. As you know me very well from the very beginning, I shall require many pictures of Pancatattva either Sankirtana or standing Five together, also the pictures of Acaryas.

Wherever a Sankirtana temple will be established, I shall require at least three pictures, namely your Spiritual Master, my Spiritual Master and the Pancatattva as they are being worshiped in the first apartment of the Temple here in L.A. These pictures may be painted on a canvas oil painting and when it is dried up they may be rolled all together and dispatched by Post Air Mail. The frame work may be done locally. Paraffin paper may be placed between paintings so they will not stick.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
