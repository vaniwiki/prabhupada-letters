My dear Balarama das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10th August 1976 and have noted the contents. However the enclosed daksina never arrived for at customs all currencies are confiscated. Therefore do not send cash in the mails again. The beads are duly chanted upon and are enclosed within along with one brahmana thread. The names are, for Bhakta Rarmer %%__%% Vrajaraja dasa, and for Bhakta Ted---Tribhuvanapati dasa. Jyotir Maya das has been accepted by me for second initiation.

Now hold a fire yajna and present the names at that time. The gayatri mantras may be heard by tape through the right ear. All of our initiated devotees must strictly chant 16 rounds a day and avoid the four pillars of sinful life completely. These four regulative principles should be lectured on by some expert speaker, as well as the ten offenses to the holy name. The brahmana must possess the qualities mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita (18.42) and take bath at least twice a day to maintain external cleanliness as well as always chanting the maha mantra for internal cleanliness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
