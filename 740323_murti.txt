Dear Murti das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter in which you propose to come to Vrindaban with your wife to help with deities, construction and preaching at our Krishna Balarama temple. After consulting with the authorities there, we all agree it would be a very good idea. So please make arrangements for your transfer here. Our Vrindaban temple is perhaps our nicest building in the whole movement and I want at least 25 good men here at all times. Because it is Vrindaban, those who come should be exemplary so that all the people of Vrindaban, even those who would be prone to criticize, will see that we are actually following the six Goswamis headed by Rupa Goswami. I want that those who come here, whether grhasthas or sannyasis, behave on the level of real goswamis. Goswami means controlling the senses and always glorifying Krsna by varieties of engagement in devotional service 24 hours a day. You may write to Gurudasa further about your plans.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
