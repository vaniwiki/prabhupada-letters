My dear Govardhana dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 8th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the photo of Sri Sri Radha Kunja-Bihari. It is very nice photo. They are looking very beautiful. I have accepted the following for 1st initiation: Bruce---Brajendralala, Miriam---Mukhya, Jeff---Jayavamana, Robin---Rajendranatha, Kim---Kaviraja, Karl---Kapiladeva, Sue---Sukti. Their beads may be chanted on by Satsvarupa Maharaja. Be sure and help them become first class devotees by following all the rules and regulations, very carefully, especially, they must rise early for mangala arati, chant at least 16 rounds and attend class.

Your list of qualifications for choosing candidates for 2nd initiation is very good. Regarding Rudra dasa, he can worship Gaura-Nitai in his home. The most important element for their worship is the chanting of the Hare Krishna Mantra. They can have at least one arati and whatever foodstuffs are prepared can be offered. Regarding my books, everyone should read. I am also reading. Everyone should be engaged 24 hours. That is the sum and substance. How much you should read and how much you should do other types of service, that has to be decided by each individual devotee. Eating and sleeping should be minimized---not a single moment should be misused.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
