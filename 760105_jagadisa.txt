My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 10th, 1975. I accept all the recommended devotees as my duly initiated disciples. Now hold a fire ceremony, and instruct the new devotees to chant 16 rounds daily and follow the regulative principles of devotional service. Their initiated names are as follows:

Bhakta Benoit---Jayagovinda das

Bhakta Arthur---Sadapusta das

Bhakta Alain---Paranagra das

Bhakta Michel---Vidyaraja das

Bhaktin Louise---Sarada dasi

Bhaktin Elizabeth---Ambhoda dasi

Bhaktin Joyce---Syamaballabha dasi

I accept Medhya devi dasi for brahminical initiation. She should hear the mantra from the tape recording through the right ear. Brahmin initiation means to keep very clean-inside by chanting the Lord's glories, and outside by regular bathing. See that she is instructed on all these things.

I hope this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
