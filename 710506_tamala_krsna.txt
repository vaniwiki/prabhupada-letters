My dear Tamala,

Please accept my blessings. You'll be glad to know that I have come to Malaysia. On Monday night there was a good meeting upon my arrival, and then yesterday I was all day busy in attending three or four meetings. All of them were very big meetings, and this place appears to be very prospective for our preaching work. People are inclined to give us land and a house. Two or three such offers are already in view. So, I'll try to open a branch immediately, either in Kuala Lumpur or Ipoh or Teluk Anson. In Teluk Anson one retired principal of college has offered a house which can be used as temple, already started very big. It is understood that the property is about fifty to sixty thousand dollars. So, things are going on nicely, and I shall be glad to hear from you about how things are going on there.

Another point is that from here I shall be going to Sydney, and then from there I shall be going to Calcutta. So, when you expect me there you can write me immediately. I hope this will meet you in good health. Offer my blessings to all others.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
