====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

Tampa

My dear Tamala Krsna das Gosvami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and I was very pleased to read the contents. This is Lord Caitanya's blessing upon you that you are executing his order. Prthivite ache yata nagaradi gram/ savatra pracara haibe mora nama. You are doing this very nicely. I heard that the Western Zone distributed more than your Radha-Damodara Traveling Sankirtana Parties. Is there a competition between you and Jayatirtha Prabhu? That is nice.

The BBT says that they are publishing at the speed of my translating and that you will distribute at the pace of their publishing. That's nice. But still I am ahead in my translation work. They owe to me now the 6th Canto of __Srimad-Bhagavatam.__ I am working on the 7th Canto already.

I am very pleased that already you have held 50 festivals in the colleges. Param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtana. And param vijayate American boys. Yes, you are doing very nicely. So many Vaisnavas have taken birth in America. Now America is going to be glorified. So many people are afraid of the American CIA. But now they will welcome Americans as American Vaisnavas.

Now maintain your status quo. You are in a very good position. To manage a sankirtana party nicely is more precious than all other activities. That is the verdict of __Bhagavad-gita__ and the mission of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

We have received good reports from Europe, Paris, Geneva, Amsterdam. And Bhagavan is doing very well. We have just now received Italian __Easy Journey__ and __Isopanisad.__

The Bombay temple progress construction is now begun. It was started by you. It is a very nice project. The temple is very large and magnificent and there are so many facilities for guests, restaurant, theater. So I am remaining here to see that the temple construction is completed. We hope that it may be completed within three months.

Now it is understood from the report of Ramesvara that Jayatirtha's zone is Number 1 and that you are Number 2. How is this?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
