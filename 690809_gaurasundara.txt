My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5 August, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. Enclosed please find one stereo tape of "Sri Krishna Caitanya Prabhu," song and purport. We have played a non-stereo tape on one recorder, and dubbed over it the sound of karatalas on a stereo tape recorder; so now the result is stereo. I do not know if this tape is suitable for your broadcast purposes, but if it is all right, please inform me. I am so pleased to read about your most recent chanting where thousands of people have heard you. It is very encouraging. Regarding your taking on an outside job, I do not think that will be nice. In Boston they have decided to purchase a large house with 16 rooms plus two halls, for the price of $70,000. The major source of payment for this house will be sales of __BTG.__ So if you can organize sales of __BTG__ and our literature very nicely in Hawaii, there will be no financial strain. Now we have a very nice book review from the "Honolulu Advertiser," so try to cooperate with the local booksellers. Regarding the boy who is now staying with you, if somebody takes shelter of our organization, we have no objection. If he desires to go to San Francisco, let him go. There is very good possibility that next week I shall be going to Boston to help them begin our Iskcon Press Department there in their new house, and from Boston I shall be going on to Europe. In the meantime, I will be remaining in Los Angeles at least till the middle of next week.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Are you getting some inquiries on a/c of the review. I think you should have some inquiries. Elsewise see the total book-sellers if they purchase some copies. The Review is nice.
