====== Letter to: R. V. Ramdas ======

New Delhi (Korelbag)

My dear Sri R. V. Ramdas,

Please accept my greetings. I have been in extensive tour all over the world, in Europe, America, Africa and very recently I have come back to India, so I have just now received your letter of 20th August, 1971 and so this late reply.

Yes, I have all good wishes for your philanthropic activities. As we are preaching Hare Krishna Movement all over the world, we should request you also to spread this movement along with your other activities.

Thanking you once again for your letter, I beg to remain

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
