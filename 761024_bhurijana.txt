My dear Bhurijana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 11, 1976 and also the letter from your good wife. Thank you for the traveler's checks in the amount of $100.

I am pleased to know that you are working hard in the service of Krsna and feeling settled in your engagement. Please take this movement very seriously.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
