My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 9th February, 1971 and have noted the contents. So far as your working engagement is concerned, certainly you are not a karmi. Any person whose constant occupation is Krishna Consciousness, he is not a karmi; he is a devotee in all circumstances. So you should accept the best source of monetary income and use it for Krishna. And that is better than sannyasa. So stick to your job and use it for Krishna Consciousness. You are not a karmi.

Here we are having a very large festival at Cross Maiden in Bombay where 20,000 to 30,000 people are attending daily for chanting, lecturing, arati and prasada distribution. You will be glad to know that both your mother and father came to visit me there. Your mother is always asking that you come with your wife and get a job in India. But I told her that you cannot get a better job here. But she is mother, and so naturally wants to see you. So I have told her that after your examinations you might conveniently come to India to visit her at her home.

So far as your plan for producing one French BTG for both Paris and Montreal, that is a very good idea. You might be interested to know that Dr. Bigelow has already acknowledged my letter and he has already admitted that our knowledge of the spirit soul is far greater than in the Western world. That he has admitted. So far as going to U.S.A., I am glad that you are going there for better occupation. And if your mentality for devotional service is good and you continue in that spirit, then surely you are a pure devotee.

Offer my blessings to your wife Ekayani. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
