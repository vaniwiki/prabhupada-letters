My dear Bhaktijana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14th inst. Why not make preaching with black people in America your lifetime preaching goal? Yes, limit to this. You preach---that is sannyasa. What is the use of changing dress? Do, actually. Regarding my leaving, I'll not leave the planet until you order.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
