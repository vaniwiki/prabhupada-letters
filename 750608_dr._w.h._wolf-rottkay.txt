====== Letter to: Dr. W.H. Wolf-Rottkay ======

Dr. W.H. Wolf-Rottkay\\

My dear Dr. Wolf-Rottkay,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 1, 1975 along with your elaboration of the word LIFE. It is very interesting. Regarding your question at the end, yes, the soul is eternal and it is transmigrating from one body to another. Therefore the body is undergoing evolution, not the soul. Just like if I come to the USA from India, I have to change my residence. I personally do not have to change, but my residence changes. So, the soul travels from one body to another and always remains the same. I shall be looking forward to your elaboration of the word MATTER.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
