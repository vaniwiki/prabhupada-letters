My dear Caranaravinda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 15-3-75 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the interesting Photographs that you sent. I am very glad to hear report of your programs going on there, especially with the young boys. Please continue these programs with added enthusiasm. They are very important. You should be very careful to follow all of the principles very rigidly. You must rise early (before 4:00 AM), attend the mangala arati, attend the classes, chant at least 16 good rounds daily, and observe the four basic principles. These things you must do without fail otherwise, there is no question of spiritual life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
