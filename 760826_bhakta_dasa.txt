My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. On your recommendation I am accepting the following boys and girls as my duly initiated disciples.

John---Jnanagati dasa

Spencer---Saktipati dasa

Orlando---Pranavananda dasa

Mark---Mitrasena dasa

Nadine---Nada dasi

Carol---Karuna dasi

All initiates of mine must strictly follow the four principles of no meat, fish or egg, eating; no gambling; no intoxication of any kind; and no illicit sex. They must chant 16 rounds a day minimum with attention, clearly chanting the mantra, and listening very carefully. This is the recommended process for purifying the heart in this sinful age of Kali. Be serious to push on this sankirtana movement of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and certainly He will bless you and your life will become perfect, __na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krtama,__ anyone who preaches this message of the Bhagavad-gita is the most dear servant of the Lord.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
