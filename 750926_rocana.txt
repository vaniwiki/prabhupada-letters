My dear Rochana das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 17, 1975 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I am accepting the the following as my initiated disciples, and their names are:

Dennis and Paula---Jnanamudra das & Trailokyasundari devi dasi

Timothy Moore---Yoginatha das

Peter and Carol Fortany---Rukminisa das and Vedagarbha devi dasi

Ken Perry---Parampadam das

Please see that that they will follow our rules and regulations and chant minimum 16 rounds daily. I also accept for second initiation Mahidhara das and Pracetana devi dasi. Enclosed is the sanctified thread and the mantra sheet.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
