My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I'm in due receipt of your letter of Nov. 30, and I duly appreciate your program for European tour, as well as coming to India for doing business. Actually we are experiencing Indian business dealing as not very prompt. The best thing is therefore to purchase goods ourselves from the firm, pack and book it all ourselves. SS Brijbasi has taken so much time for nothing, they do not even reply letters, but on the other hand they have promptly delivered Mukunda's order, this means that business managing is not regular. You can send the copy of the letter to Acyutananda in which they have acknowledged payment. Acyutananda and Ramanuja will return to Vrindaban next week and I am starting for Japan on Sun or Mon __positively.__ I shall try to get some Friends there and also try to meet Prof Rudolf Stein in Hawaii.

While I shall try to open some branches in the Pacific you can also try to open branches in parts of Europe as you have suggested in your letter under reply. I'm trying to find out some reliable man who can purchase goods and book them personally. If you come here it will be a nice idea, but you should come with money, purchase the goods and book them immediately. Air cargo will be too costly, we have already sent 1 tanpura to Mukunda and the cost was 106 Rs. but air cargo was 1,100 Rs. So you cannot do business by paying 11 times more than the cost for freight. Regarding books I've already consigned along with mrdangams harmoniums karatalas and beads & bags. I have arranged for supplying incense with a gentleman here and I'm taking samples with me. Similarly I've arranged for sending spices and frankincense. The contact with MacMillan should be finished before you leave. Your journey, as you have suggested is important for your touring in Europe. We cannot expect any tangible help from Miss Bowtell. She is not my godsister but a disciple of my godbrother. The best thing will be to start a center independently.

Regarding beautifying the temple, we should always know that every place is temporary, but wherever we live we should decorate and beautify it for Krishna, so go on decorating our temple as nicely as possible. Hope you are well

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
