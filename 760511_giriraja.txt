Bombay

My dear Giriraja das,

Please accept my blessings. So far the new towers are concerned, not a single space should be allotted without my permission. When completed it will be a wonderful building and we want to keep it open for people to visit from all over the world. We are expecting guests like hotel so the rooms must be available. I also want to know what terms you have arranged with persons who gave substantial contributions for building the rooms in the towers. Please relay this information to me immediately.

Also, I am finding that there is one oil which Pradyumna brought with him from Bombay, it is helping to relieve the pressure on the head a little. You can send me 3 bottles of this oil, Brahmi oil, made by the Sadhana Ausadhala; they have a place in Bombay near the intersection of Kalpadevi Rd. and Princess St. It must be packed very nicely otherwise the bottles will break or leak. To stop leakage, you can melt some parrafin, and seal the bottles with the caps on by dipping the side of the bottle with cap into the liquid parrafin, and when it is pulled out and cooled, it will seal the space around the cap. Then also there should be some soft packing around the bottles so that they do not break in transit. Best if someone is coming personally to the U.S.A., they can bring it with them, but if that is not possible at this time, then send it nicely as above mentioned. You can send it to me care of the Los Angeles Temple as we will be there just after the beginning of June. Send it registered and special delivery so that it is handled very fragilely.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
