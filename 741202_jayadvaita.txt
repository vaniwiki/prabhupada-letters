My dear Jayadvaita das:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen on the new books printed that on the spine of the jacket the words “Bhaktivedanta Book Trust” have been omitted. Formally they were there on all the books. It is understood from Ramesvara that you removed these words. Why did you do this? Who authorized it? Did Bali Mardan authorize it? These things must be there. Please see to it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
