All GBC Secretaries

Dear GBC Prabhu:

Please accept our humble obeisances at your feet. It has come to His Divine Grace's attention that many members of our society are engaged in the same business that Rsabhdeva (ex-President Laguna Beach) and devotees of Laguna Beach Temple were engaged in. These devotees were recently in Delhi and Calcutta. Some of them also met one of our GBC men in Hongkong. The list of devotees doing this business includes some senior devotees. Furthermore, it was discovered that some GBC members were backing these projects. Exact details on how these activities are carried out were revealed by a participant and His Divine Grace is thoroughly aware of the entire operation now.

His Divine Grace is very very unhappy about this. He said that under no circumstances can any GBC or Temple President accept any money from these devotees. This business has to be stopped at once immediately. His Divine Grace wants all of you to refer to the instruction of 3rd verse of Upadesamrta. First and foremost our profession must be very hones---above all suspicion. His Divine Grace said "I am trying to retire from management to translate but if these things come then how can I translate. I have set up the framework and everything should be done within the framework. Kindly see that this business is stopped at once."
