My dear Bhagavata das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 2, 1975 with enclosed articles and I have noted the article. So those who say that the Mahabharata battle was fought 3,000 B.C., that is correct. But they had a big, big meeting with big, big professors but was there any conclusion? No. So therefore these kinds of meetings are all useless. Unless there is some conclusion, it is simply a waste of time.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
