Dear Sir:

In reference to your letter no. 20/149 dated 21st April, 1971, I beg to inform you that generally I visit my branches in Bombay, Calcutta, Gorakhpur and Delhi and sometimes I go outside also. If you will kindly give me a general letter of introduction so that wherever I go I can show the local manager that letter and he will transfer my money without any charges. That will be convenient for both you and me.

I thank you very much for your giving this facility so that there will be no inconvenience for transferring my money by mail,

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
