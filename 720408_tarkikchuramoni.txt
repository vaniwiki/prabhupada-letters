My dear daughter,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Bibhu I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. Your beads have been duly chanted on by me and they are sent under separate post. Your spiritual name is Tarkikchuramoni Devi Dasi.

I am so glad to learn that you have been such a great help to Bibhu there in our Pittsburgh center. I can understand that you are a very sincere student and are an eligible candidate for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street sankirtana, etc. In this way you keep yourself engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours a day and you will be really happy in this life and in the end reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
