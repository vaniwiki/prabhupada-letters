My dear Sudama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 28, 1973. I have noted the contents carefully.

 My sanction for the deities in the touring van is still there. But I have heard that sometimes the deity falls down, so these things are objectionable. Touring and book distribution, side by side, this is the main business. The general public will not be very much interested to see the deity, it is our personal business. When you contact with the mass of people Sankirtana is the main business. So considering all these point you do the needful, I have no objection.

I hope this letter meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
