====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

Boston

My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. You will be pleased to know than I have again begun my translating work. Enclosed please find tape no. 1 from L.A. (Srimad-Bhagavatam, 4th canto, 8th chapter). Please acknowledge receipt and date of receipt also.

Presently I am in L.A. where I just returned from the very successful festival, Rathayatra festival, in San Francisco. From here I will be going to London to participate in their Rathayatra festival on 4th July. Shortly thereafter I may be going to N.Y.

Formerly, in 1966, I was dictating two tapes daily, but after becoming ill, I reduced. But very soon I will be sending you so many tapes that you will be over-burdened with work.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
