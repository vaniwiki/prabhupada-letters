My dear Acyutananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 20, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. But I do not find any mention of how the progress is going on at Mayapur. This is our very important project, and I have entrusted the work to Tamala Krsna, yourself, along with Bhavananda and Jayapataka, but none of you are writing in this respect so I do not know what is happening there. So I am very much concerned to be always informed how the progress is going on, and I have recently received telegrams regarding our money transaction and have replied duly, but still there is no word from your side in this matter also.

I am pleased to hear that the song books and tapes of Lalita Prasad Thakura are in New York for being edited and distributed. To answer your questions, the Deities in London, New York, etc. are not mentioned in TLC, the Deities mentioned there were before these Deities were installed. In Caitanya Caritamrta there is mentioned that all over the world there are to be found many Deities. They may be covered by flood, devastation, and so on. Svayam Prakasa refers to Baladeva. So far the songs of Jayadeva are concerned, there is one, Srita Kamala. Yes, if you want to translate the Bhakti-Ratnakara. When I go to New York in a few days, namely on June 2nd, I shall be very glad to peruse the tapes and writings you have sent there.

Hoping this will meet you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
