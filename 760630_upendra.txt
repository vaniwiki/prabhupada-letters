Lautoka, Fiji

My dear Upendra dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 20, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Unless the temple is fully under our control, we are not interested. Then we shall call it back. I will decide on receipt of the reply to this letter to Vasudeva dasa (Mr. Punja). So far the Fiji constitution is concerned, where it says: "supplying needs to the sick, poor, and orphans, etc." That is not our program. We distribute prasadam to everyone, not particularly to the needy. We make no discrimination, rich or poor.

I think that the enclosed copy of letter to Vasudeva is self-explanatory and I am awaiting his reply in New York where I shall further inform you concerning our project there. We cannot keep the temple in his private name and use our ISKCON name. Please keep me informed of the situation.

Hoping that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
