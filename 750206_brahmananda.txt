My dear Brahmananda Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I have heard that you want to make apologies to the police and others. This policy is not at all good. We cannot apologize. We have not done anything wrong. Our policy should be to protest against this persecution if they are determined to suppress our movement there. However, everything can be settled peacefully, if they agree to drop the charges and give us facility to push on our movement without further harassment in the future. These are the two points to be considered, so, discuss with Hansadutta and Bhagavan and do the needful.

I am coming to London via New York by the 2nd of March and you can meet me there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
