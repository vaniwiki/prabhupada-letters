Dear Sir:

With reference to your letter number 20/84, dated 2nd March, 1971, addressed to Gorakhpur, I beg to inform you that I have come back to Bombay and I am travelling all over the country. I shall therefore require to transfer money from anywhere, especially Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, Gorakhpur, etc.

Please also open an H.S.S. Account "A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami" and credit Rs. 229.00.

Thanking you for your usual cooperation. I am,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
