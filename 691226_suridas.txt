My dear Suridas,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife, Jotilla, and the others. I request you to simply translate into the French language our __Back To Godhead__ and send the matters to Jaya Govinda for composing. In due course of time you will get the magazines, by selling which you try to pay part of the composing machine that Jaya Govinda is going to purchase. So you begin this business immediately and open correspondence with Jaya Govinda

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
