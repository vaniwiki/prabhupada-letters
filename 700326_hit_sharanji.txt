====== Letter to: Hit Sharanji ======

Scindia House\\
New Delhi

My dear Hit Sharanji,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your copy of the letter to Sri Trivedi, dated 9th March, 1970.

In the meantime, I have received a letter from Sri Trivedi that he has arranged to dispatch the three pairs of Murtis to different places, but I do not know if Sri M. L. Chand of Dalmia Cement Ltd. has already handed over the Murtis to the care of Sri N. M. Trivedi.

Then, what about the other two pairs of Murtis? Are they already delivered to you? If so, you can dispatch them similarly for Los Angeles, Besides that, Srimati Sumati Morarji of Bombay has agreed to donate some Murtis herself, as well as through some friends. She wants to know the price of the Murtis and the place from where they can be had. It is understood that you have already written to Jaipur about the cost of marble Murtis. I hope by this time you have received the cost. If so, kindly inform me as well as Srimati Sumati Morarji because we require immediately at least one dozen Murtis for different places.

We require at least one pair of Murtis exactly like that of London, for which you have got the picture, for our Paris center. Kindly therefore enlighten me on the above subject by return post, and oblige.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have received one letter from Sethji acknowledging my book, Sri Isopanisad. Please convey my regards for him.\\
