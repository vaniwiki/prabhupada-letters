My dear Atreya Rsi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your special delivery letter dated May 4, 1973.

Regarding Navayauvana Prabhu in Chicago going with you to Iran; yes it is all right. He is anxious to go so he can accompany you and help to begin one center in that country.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
