Dear Sri Agrawal,

Please accept my greetings. I thank you very much for your calendar presentation which I received Wednesday morning on the 18 of December. The pictures on your calendar are very beautiful and much appreciated by me. I am very sorry that I was not able to see you when you came. But I am hoping that you will be able to come again maybe between 5 and 7 p.m. and I will see you then. I will be in Bombay for about one more month and then I may go to Australia.

I thank you very much once again for your calendar and I hope to be seeing you in the near future. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
