My dear Joy Deb,

Please accept my blessings. I have duly received your card sent through my devotees and I am so glad to hear from you after so long a time. I am sending herein an invitation card for our Vrndavana festival from the 20th through the 26th of April. And it will be my great pleasure if you attend the ceremony along with your mother. I hope this will meet you in good health along with your brothers and other family members.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
