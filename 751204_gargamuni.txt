My dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 11, November 1975, I have noted the contents carefully. Yes! your present engagement is more important, managing Calcutta temple is not so important. I am pleased that you are selling my books, this is superior engagement, so please continue and increase it more and more.

Your plan for the busses is nice. One address in Yugoslavia is Vladimir Radovanov, 45 Skadarska, Belgrade.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
