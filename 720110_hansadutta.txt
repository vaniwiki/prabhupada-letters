====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

Hamburg

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of December 18, 1971, and I am very much pleased that now both of you and Krishna das are working there very nicely together. Now you both couples just remain together for some time and build up Germany centers very strong, especially Hamburg, and then you may return at a suitable time to your zone of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries. I think that Brahmananda is doing very nicely in Africa, so for the time being there is no need to go there or interfere.

I am always wondering why after so many years nothing can be done to print profusely my books and literatures in European languages. Translators are there, all facilities of German first-class printing machines are there---simply we are not serious to do it. Now you and Krishna das work combinedly to arrange for printing of so many books in Germany, French, and other languages. That will be a great help to me. I have given Krishna das suggestion to purchase one van there and drive it to India. What do you think?

I am going to Nairobi for a few days from the 25th January, returning by 1st February. Then we shall hold our programs in Ahmedabad, Madras, Mayapur.*

Hoping this will meet you and your good wife, Mataji, in strong health and lively mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Please know it always that I think of you and your wife as very sincere devotees and whenever you think, you can ask me everything about your difficulties.\\
