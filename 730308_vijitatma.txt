My dear Vijitatma:

Please accept my blessings. I have received your $100.00 daksina and I thank you very much for it.

Actually, everyone is trying to enjoy Laksmi without Narayana. Ultimately, the Mayavadi is envious of Krsna and wants to enjoy the original Laksmi, therefore they call each other "namo Narayana", they sit around and address each other as Narayana. This is the greatest offense, and they are actually unfortunate because they do not engage in devotional service. The Goddess of Fortune Laksmi is fickle towards the materialist, sometimes he is prince and sometimes he is pauper. But Laksmi cannot leave the side of Lord Narayana and wherever Lord Narayana is worshiped with care, good fortune and opulence is there. Therefore, the devotee is known as the most fortunate, and you American boys and girls are the most fortunate of all, now make everyone else fortunate by spreading this Krsna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
