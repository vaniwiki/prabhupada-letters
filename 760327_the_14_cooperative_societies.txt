Juhu, Bombay-56

Dear Sir:

As you may know, our Hare Krishna Land is very popular with the residents of Bombay, in particular the local residents and devotees of Juhu Beach and surroundings. Many visitors regularly attend religious services and we are trying to provide suitable facilities to this end.

Now with so many devotees visiting from the colony, it is necessary that we have access from the colony side to the temple. At present we only have access to the temple from the sea-side and it is proving a great inconvenience to visitors coming from the colony side. We therefore request that access be kindly granted to us on the colony side for the benefit of the many worshipers who regularly visit the temple. We request that you kindly give us permission to construct a suitable access to our property from the colony side and that you kindly provide us such land for use as may be necessary.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
