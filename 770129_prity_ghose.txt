Dear Mr. Prity Ghose,

Please accept my greetings. I have received your letter of January 5, 1977, and appreciate your offer to perform Krishna Lila dance and music in connection with our ISKCON Movement. It will not, however, be possible for us to pay your passage fare in touring. If you can still join us, you will receive all other facilities, room and board at our centers. But I don't know whether you are accustomed to following the regulative principles for stay in our centers, such as no meat eating, no intoxication, no illicit sex, no gambling. Otherwise, we can supply your needs, and we also have a dance and theater troupe coming from New York to perform at our Bombay center. If you can cooperate with our troupe we can have many presentations from Krsna Leela, Ramayana, etc. We are attempting to establish the movement of pure devotional service to Lord Krsna all over the world, and we welcome your joining us in this endeavor which will bring the highest benefit to the suffering humanity.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
