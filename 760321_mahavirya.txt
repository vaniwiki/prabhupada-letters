Nairobi

My dear Mahavirya,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 1-3-76, and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning your request for babaji initiation, when I come to Nairobi we can discuss it further. I gave babaji initiation to one other devotee but now he is off somewhere restless.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
