My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 5th January, 1976.

Your normal life is Krishna Consciousness. If you so desire you can stay in Mayapur without taking any responsibility. Simply read books, take Prasadam, and chant Hare Krishna. Now, for the time being, you stay with your father. Later on you can decide.

I hope you are recovering.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
