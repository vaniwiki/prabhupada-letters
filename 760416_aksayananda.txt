My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received one invitation for a preaching engagement in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. There is some function there from the 6th May to the 13rd May, 1976, and we have been invited for preaching. They have mentioned taking care of all arrangement and expenses. If you are free you can go there and preach at this program. The gentleman's name is: Sri Hari, address below:

Sri Hari Mandir, Solan

Quarter 3, (number 3)

Somash Kanda,

Giri Nagar,

Kalkazi, New Delhi (110019)\\
You can contact him at this address for further information.

Hoping that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
