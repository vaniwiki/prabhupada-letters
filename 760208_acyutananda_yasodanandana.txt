Guntur, A.P., India

My dear Acyutananda and Yasodanandana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 2 February 1976.

Now we have books in so many different languages, they simply have to be distributed everywhere. Then gradually by reading them our movement will be appreciated by all.

Go on preaching, chanting, distributing prasadam and selling our books. I shall see you when you arrive in Mayapur. I may go to Bengala Desh at the end of February.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
