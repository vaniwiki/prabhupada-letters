My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 29, 1973.

Regarding the estimates for the two Bengali books, please get estimates from Dai Nippon.

I am pleased to learn that the devotees who will be going to India are taking twenty paintings with them to our Mayapur center. I want that all rooms and verandas and especially the Deity hall should have first class paintings. They will appreciate how expertly the American artists are doing.

We want to solve this big problem of supplying mrdangas and also learn how to make dolls for exhibiting pastimes of the Lord. Therefore I want devotees to learn these arts in Mayapur.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
