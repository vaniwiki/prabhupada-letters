====== Letter to: Pradyumna ======

My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 14, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am pleased to note that everything is going on very harmoniously in your temple, and this is a symptom that you are all executing your Krishna Conscious duties nicely. You mention that you are fixing up your temple for nice Love feast program and this is cent per cent approved by me. Try to have very nice Love feasts, because here in Los Angeles they are constantly attracting more and more members to join them, and the Love feast program is one of the very strong attracting influences. This program of offering grand scale quantities of prasadam amongst the general people was encouraged by Lord Caitanya, because if someone partakes of the remnants of offerings to Lord Krishna, then he is sure to come back to Krishna Consciousness again at one time or another. So propagate our processes of Sankirtana, sumptuous Love feasts, and reading literatures of Krishna Consciousness, and surely many persons will be attracted to join this sublime movement.

Regarding the Composer Machine, let things go on as quickly as possible, and when the earliest time can be set up, then Arundhati and Syama Dasi will learn how to operate the machine. This Composer is a vital part of our book program, so if you can do it combinedly very nicely, it will be the greatest service to my Guru Maharaja.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B.: I have spoken with Tamala Krishna, and he will soon arrange to send you one brahmacari to help you in your Sankirtana activities.
