Dear Aksayananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated December 27th and January 12th respectively, and have noted the contents. Since we are bound to go ahead with the sewer-line, what can be done, so do it. There is no need to send me the plans for the dharmasala, simply go ahead and begin. I am staying here at least until Feb. 2nd for laying the cornerstone of our new temple, then sometime afterwards, I will be going to Mayapur.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
