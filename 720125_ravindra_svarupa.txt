Dear Ravindra Svarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated January 12, 1972 and have noted the contents carefully.

Krishna book distribution is our greatest propaganda for spreading Krishna Consciousness. You must secure one letter from Temple University stating that our __Nectar of Devotion__ is being used as a text. This will be very helpful in introducing our literature in all the big Universities all over the country. This is very important, so you may do it immediately.

Regarding householders living in the temple; in India no woman is allowed to stay in the temple at night. But for our preaching work I have permitted women to stay in the temple. But, in the temple, husband and wife should live separately. There are many young brahmacaris and Sannyasis in the temple and men and women living together is simply a source of agitation, so therefore this is my order; ideally the husband and wife can live separately in the temple. If this is not possible they should live together close to the temple and attend temple arati etc . . . and if this is not possible the last alternative is to live away from the Temple and conduct your own deity worship etc. It is best to do the most ideal thing but whatever mode of living you chose the most important thing is to always remain one hundred percent in service of Radha-Krishna. The initiation of Michael Stein is approved and beads are being sent in separate cover.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
