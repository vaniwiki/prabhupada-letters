Dear Dr. Bhatt,

Please accept my greetings and thanks for your appreciative review of Srimad-Bhagavatam. I am trying my best to publish the entire Srimad-Bhagavatam, which will be about 60 volumes. Thank you very much for your encouragement.

I hope this meets you well.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
