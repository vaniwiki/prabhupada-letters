Dear Sir:

Please be advised that my student, Mr. Gregory M. Scharf (Gargamuni Swami) was sent here to India by me for his immediate assistance was required. In New York he was told at the Indian High Commission that an entry visa would take 11 weeks, however, I required his assistance immediately, so he arrived on a tourist visa. Since his service here in India is valuable as GBC (Governing Body Commissioner) for our branch in Mayapur, International Society for Krishna Consciousness, kindly give him visa. Your willing assistance in this matter will be much helpful.

Your sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

ACBS/pks
