Dear Glendon Tremaine:

Please accept my respects. I thank you very much for your letter dated October 4, 1972, with enclosure from Ambubhai & Diwanji. I am surprised to learn how he has ceased to become my attorney without my advice, nor do I have any information as to who is acting as my attorney. Will you kindly inquire from him to enlighten when and how he has ceased to become my attorney.

Thanking you once more,

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
