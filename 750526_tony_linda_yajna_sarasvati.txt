My dear Tony, Linda, & Yajna Sarasvati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 20th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am very glad that you are trying to live Krishna Conscious lifestyle. If you simply try to follow very carefully the prescribed method that has been chalked out for us in the vedas, refrain from eating meat, having illicit sex life, taking intoxications, and gambling, and try to chant 16 rounds on you beads daily, read our books regularly and discuss them, rise early, and eat only Krishna prasadam. By following this path and associating as much as possible with pure devotees, you will go back to your original state---pure spirit soul, eternal servant of Krishna. Please visit our temple there in New Zealand and take advice from them how to advance in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
