My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your questionnaire note for tape No. 20, and the answers are as follows:

1. Pg. 9 line 14 you can make it __Kartikeya.__

2. Pg. 9 line 15: In my Srimad-Bhagavatam it is written Sri Sailam. At that time it was known as Sailapura, and now it is known as Solapura. It is still a pilgrimage in Mahar, and because Balaramaji was traveling in South India, this is Solapura is in South India.

3. Pg. 9 line 18; yes, Dravidadesa is correct.

4. Pg. 9 third paragraph: Bvankatachaila is incorrect. It should be __Venkatacala.__

5. Pg. 10: panda is correct

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Arundhati. I hope you are both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Regarding point #2: you can put the present name "Solapura" and then in parenthesis (Sailapura).\\
