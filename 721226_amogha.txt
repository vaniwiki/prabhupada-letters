====== Letter to: Amogha ======

Djakarta

My dear Amogha,

Please accept my blessings. I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 1, 1972, and I have noted the contents. It is very much pleasing to me to hear that you are making such steady advancement in Krishna Consciousness. If you continue in this way, and strictly follow the four regulative principles, making sure to chant at least sixteen rounds on the beads, daily, it is without a doubt that at the end of this lifetime, you can go back home, back to Godhead.

You mention that the Indonesians inside the country are good people. Yes, try to make local men into devotees. When I shall come there I shall try to convince that boy who owns the printing press. Don't neglect the Hindus. Collect money from them for printing and pushing on our preaching work. They are able to give enough money, but don't bother to try to mix with or preach to them excessively. Real business is to convert the local men to become Krishna Conscious and carry on the work.

I shall be going there near February 1, so you may do the needful.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
