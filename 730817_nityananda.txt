My dear Nityananda,

Please my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 14, 1973. Regarding the deity installation you may consult Satsvarupa Goswami your GBC secretary for this. I have appointed these GBC men to oversee and manage all the affairs of the society giving me relief to do my translation work fully.

On your recommendation I accept Srimati Hamsini Devi Dasi for second initiation. Please find the Gayatri Mantra enclosed.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
