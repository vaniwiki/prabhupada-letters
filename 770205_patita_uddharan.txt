Mayapur

Dear Patita Uddharan,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 16, relating your preaching activities of your trip to Tirupati.

Regarding the astronomy book written by Dr. Arkasomayaji, I find it is influenced by the western concept of astronomy. At least as he presents the subject in this book we could not employ his interpretation in our temple in Mayapur. I have had my secretary write to him, however, inviting him to Mayapur for further discussion on this subject. If he is willing and able to depict the planetary situations exactly as presented in Srimad Bhagavatam, then he may be useful.

As for the ayurvedic Kaviraj who is willing to send vasanta kusumakara rasa, yes have him do it.

Preaching before gatherings in schools is very nice. Be always very careful to present the conclusion of Krsna consciousness exactly as you have learned it from my books and lectures; that is it the disciplic succession, and our potency lies in presenting our understanding of Krsna as he is, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We cannot compromise in any one with any other understanding. Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
