My dear Ādi Kesava Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 2, 1974 with enclosed letters from the initiates. Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following as my initiated disciples.

1. Ted Prior---Tatpara dasa

2. Louis Soules---Ladhvamsi dasa

Also, I am accepting the second initiation of Bhudhara dasa, Prthusrava dasa, and Narindra dasa. Enclosed are the sanctified threads and the mantra sheet. The beads may be chanted upon by a sannyasi or GBC man. You should hold a fire sacrifice amongst the devotees, and they can hear the mantra through the right ear. The mantra should be recited three times daily.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
