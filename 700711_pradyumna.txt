My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters, one dated 6th July, 1970, and the other listing Sanskrit points from Tape #43, Chapter 90 of KRSNA. So I have noted the corrections in each case and I am returning the sheets to you herewith.

I am very happy to know that your family is doing well in Krsna consciousness. Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Arundhati, and your son, Aniruddha.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
