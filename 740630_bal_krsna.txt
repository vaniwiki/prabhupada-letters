Dear Bal Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram of June 28, 1974.

Allow me to congratulate you and your wife for giving birth to a new child. Now see that she is raised in Krsna Consciousness so that at the end of this life she can go back to Home, back to Godhead. As far as my blessing is concerned it does not require my physical presence. If you are chanting Hare Krishna there and following my instructions, reading the books, taking only Krsna prasadam etc., then there is no question of your not receiving the blessings of Lord Caitanya whose mission I am humbly trying to push on.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
