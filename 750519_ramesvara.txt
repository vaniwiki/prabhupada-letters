My dear Ramesvara dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 7th, 1975 and I have noted the contents. I am extremely happy to hear that a firm of young lawyers are now working with us to help us spread this movement by helping us to flood the world with our books. This is very welcome news. Things are looking very favorable for us, now we simply have to try even harder to sincerely carry out Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's orders and He will be pleased to provide us with more and more facilities. Co-operate nicely with one another and strongly push on this mission by printing and distributing our books in unlimited quantity.

Yes, let Hayagriva come to Los Angeles, he is very intelligent. He is becoming more enthused. That is very good.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
