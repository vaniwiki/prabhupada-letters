Dear Ajita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 9 April.

The devotees recommended by you for initiation are accepted by me as my disciples, and their new spiritual names are as follows:

Arne Ekstrand---Aristahe das\\
Lena Nilsson---Sriharini dasi\\
Inga Scavenius---Iccha dasi

Be sure to instruct them on chanting at least 16 rounds daily and avoiding the four offenses---as that is the life of Krishna Consciousness. We get devotees after much difficulty, now you have to keep them nicely and see they are always engaged in serving Krsna.

I want to come to Stockholm on my upcoming European tour. Bhagavan das has been arranging a number of festivals for me to speak at as well as meeting important people in Rome, Paris and Geneva. Please get in touch with him and if possible schedule a meeting with some important men of your country who may be interested in understanding the science of Krsna. Of course hardly anyone is interest in achieving his real self interest, love of Krsna, but our presentation is so scientific that learned persons are appreciating it all over the world. So if some of the leading citizens of Stockholm want to meet with me, or if you can arrange a festival with Bhagavan das and Hansadutta then I can include it on my tour. Please fix up a time when I can come conveniently as after visiting Paris I shall be free to come to Germany and Stockholm also if you like. You can write me care of our Vrindaban temple where I am going in a few days.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
