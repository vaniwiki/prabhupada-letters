My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received back the tape which you have typewritten. The inquiry about __porce__ should be __force.__ Today I am sending you two Krishna Conscious lectures, tape recorded into the dictaphone. Please write them properly and send me one copy. The best thing will be as soon as you typewrite the two, send me one copy after editing as you were doing formerly. I'll keep one copy with me, you keep one copy with you, and if further editing is required for which another copy should be kept with you.

You will be glad to know that yesterday I have signed the agreement with MacMillan for publishing Gitopanisad, and also, Mr. B. K. Nehru was met by me day before yesterday and he has promised to help me in getting the permanent visa.

So far my health is concerned, Gaurasundara is keeping me quite fit by massaging and Govinda dasi is supplying me upma. Perhaps you have never tasted what is upma. But if Jadurani can prepare it I shall send the formula.

Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
