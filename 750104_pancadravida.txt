Bangkok

My dear Pancadravida Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 29th, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am sending this letter via one friend who will be coming to Bangkok tomorrow. He will deliver the letter to a Mr. Panikar who will bring it to you. This Mr. Panikar has been recommended to me by one of our life members here as someone who can sign the registration. Along with him, there is a Mr. Raman and a Mr. Chaisrikyl (Thai citizen). Mr. Panikar should be able to advise you how to get in touch with these men also.

Regarding sending men to Bangkok, let us see who is a spare man or is having visa problems. But our policy as you know is not to import devotees, but to make devotees out of the local men there. That is better.

Regarding the German situation, it is an attempt to suppress our movement there. We have become very popular there and now the Christian church, as well as the police are very much feeling pressure that "now this movement is increasing." The son of one big police officer has joined us and so his father has a grudge and has tried to cause counter-propaganda to be spread.

Please go on with your work there with continued enthusiasm. The Bombay business is still not yet finished so I have not been able to fix up my journey out of Bombay yet.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
