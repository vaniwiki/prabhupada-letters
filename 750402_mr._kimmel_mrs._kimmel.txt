My dear Mr. & Mrs. Kimmel,

Please accept my greetings. I have received your kind offering of guava jam through your daughter, Urvasi devi dasi. I wanted to thank you very much for becoming so much interested in our Krishna Consciousness movement. Actually, because Krishna Consciousness is the nature of the soul, it is not unusual that one becomes attracted to the method. We are trying very hard to give everyone in the world, in all walks of life, a chance to hear the message of Krishna and to take up the process which is recommended in the Bhagavad-gita for becoming freed from the cycle of birth and death, and thus go back to the kingdom of God to render eternal service to Him. I sincerely hope that you will continue the process as your good daughter has done and achieve the perfection of human life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
