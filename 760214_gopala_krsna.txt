New Delhi

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram and have noted the contents.

Regarding the house, it is nice, but again after just two years we will have to vacate. Why such a short lease? Why not get a long lease?

It is very nice that the Delhi libraries are buying a big order of our Bhagavatam.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
