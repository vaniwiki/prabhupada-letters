My dear Vinode Patel,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th July, 1968, delivered to me just yesterday, after a month, on account of the mail strike. Anyway, I am very glad to learn that you are approaching the Gujarati people in San Francisco, and asking them for their support in the temple, that is a great satisfaction for me. Next time when I go to San Francisco, I wish to visit personally all the Gujarati residents of San Francisco, through your exigency and I shall be glad to speak to them about my mission. My mission is to establish that __Krishna Stu Bhagavan Swayam.__ The International Society for Krishna Consciousness wants to establish that one God, one scripture, one mantra, and one service. One God is Krishna, one scripture is Bhagavad-gita, one mantra is Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, and one service means everything for the Lord. So it is pleasing to me that the Gujarati ladies and gentlemen who are in San Francisco, they should take keen interest in this movement because superficially or from the historical point of view, Krishna was a Gujarati. His father was a Gujarati, but His maternal uncle's house was in Mathura. And His foster father's house was at Vrindaban. So of course, these are superficial, so even we take Krishna as a historical Person, the Gujaratis must take more interest than others.

I thank you very much for your promise that you shall try your best to cooperate with me, and in my movement, and for the temple, and for which all blessings and Grace of Krishna will be bestowed upon you. I beg to remain,

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
