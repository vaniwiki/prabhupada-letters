My dear Mahamsa Svami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10-1-75 and have noted the contents. Mr. Badruka came and talked with me about the land, but I don't know whether he wants to sell it or give it to us. It is not clear. But he has invited me to see the land when I come to Hyderabad. I have agreed to this.

So far the Nellore property is concerned, that is a nice proposal. Now, we should have self-sufficiency. This means to make our own food grains grow and to weave our own cloth---like in Mayapur. If we have food grains, milk, and cloth life becomes easy and we can save time for preaching and chanting. Not that everyone should do these activities of farming, but if one is less intelligent, or not intelligent enough to preach nicely, he can do. If one is capable, then he should preach. On the whole, our society should be divided into 4 divisions, but such divisions are not material. Just like Krishna belonged to the Vaisya community, but he is worshiped by the brahmanas. We shall utilize everything for Krishna's service.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
