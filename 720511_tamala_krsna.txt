Mayapur

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of the photographs of Mayapur project. You have sent pictures of building materials, but I want pictures of buildings. There will be no scarcity of money for the work, so you try to raise fund locally as far as possible. But whenever there is scarcity of money, you will have it in the usual way as you have already got it. So do everything very nicely and quickly, so that next autumn when I go I can enter into my house. Do not destroy that cottage where I stayed last time, that is very dear to me.

Actually, Krishna does not require anything from us. He is complete in Himself, but He is most pleased to see that we are very much enthusiastic to serve Him. That much He wants, that is bhakti, that enthusiasm for Krishna's service. So do not lack this enthusiasm, try to do it to the best capacity and that will be recognized by Krishna.

You have got now godown for 100 tons cement, so finish it as soon as possible, otherwise there is risk of flood and all the cement will be spoiled. So immediately finish it. But finishing does not mean spoiling: utilize it properly. As you requested me, I have sent many men from U.S.A. to help you, now you engage them properly, utilize them, that is leadership, how to engage everyone in their respective duties and properly utilize their energy.

What are your plans for Bangladesh? That is great opportunity, and when Americans will speak about this philosophy, the Muslims in Bangladesh will agree to hear and it will be very convincing. Try to convince upon them the high philosophy we follow. This is the only means to unify the whole world.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
