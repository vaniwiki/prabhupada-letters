My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 18, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. Regarding the house, you must know that it is in a residential area, and I don't know if you can get a license for a temple there. In the present temple, there is no temple license but we have freedom to chant and dance as we like. However, if we chant and dance in this new house I am wondering if the neighbors will not object.

Without any license you will have to stop kirtanas immediately if this should happen. In my apartment on the same street as the new house I had the experience that one day there was playing of the mrdanga and immediately there was objection. So these things must be carefully considered before making a final decision. Also, because there are several new people coming to kirtanas there, you must be sure that there is ample room for them to be comfortable. Anyway, before there is a final settlement of this house affair, please hold a meeting amongst yourselves to discuss this matter further. The meeting should include Janardana, Dayala Nitai, Jayapataka, etc. Already you have a very nice temple on Park Avenue so before you make any plans to change this you must make sure that this move is very carefully thought out.

Regarding Brahma Samhita, this book shall be included in the examination of the second year along with Srimad-Bhagavatam. I don't know why you are so concerned with starting with the Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu already. First study carefully the Bhagavad-gita As It Is. This is the most important book for you to learn at first. I am pleased to learn that Eve Levine is expert typist, and that she is willing to begin typing the __Vedanta Sutras.__ She will require a dictaphone for this work, and I would like to know if there is one available for her. Also, I am very encouraged to learn that Jayapataka has taken the initiative to look for kirtana engagements for your temple. He is a very good boy and you should encourage him to do this important assignment very nicely.

So far as the 24" murtis which Gopala Krishna has agreed to donate, I have information that They will cost about $250.00 including the cost of shipping up to Montreal. So either Gopala Krishna may write to his father or else he may donate the money to the temple and we shall get the murtis from Vrindaban. Regarding Himavati's visit home, if it becomes necessary, the idea is all right.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
