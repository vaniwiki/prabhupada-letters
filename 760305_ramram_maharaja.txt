Dear RamRam Maharaja,

Thank you very much for your kind letter dated 11th February, 1976. And please accept my greetings.

As I am scheduled to stay in Mayapur up to the end of March, I am giving a copy of your letter to my zonal secretary. So you should hear from him shortly.

I beg to remain

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
