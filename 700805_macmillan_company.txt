Gentlemen:

Regarding my book, THE BHAGAVAD GITA AS IT IS, I have written you on the 18th July, 1970, regarding whether Macmillan wants to publish an expanded version of the GITA. However, I have not yet received any reply.

I should very much appreciate knowing what your intentions are regarding this matter. If MacMillan does not desire to publish this expanded version, then I will have it published elsewhere immediately.

I hope to hear from you at the earliest date possible.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
