My dear John Milner,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5th July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear that you will be going with Brahmananda Maharaja to Africa and that Harold Prabhu will be going also. When I was in Bombay, Brahmananda Maharaja told me about you and I agreed that it would be nice if you came to assist him in his mission. So make arrangements immediately for going.

Yes, I will be very glad to initiate you both before you embark. Depending on whether or not there will be a function in Mayapur in mid-August, I will be going to N.Y. If the Mayapur program is fixed up then I will leave for N.Y. by the 15th of this month. Otherwise, I will be staying in L.A. for some time. So if I go, then you can meet me there, or if not you can come here. Actually it is better to take initiation personally and receive instructions before leaving for Africa. So you can make arrangements accordingly.

Please offer my blessings to Karunamoya Prabhu at the University of Massachusetts. Ask him to write me and let me know how his preaching program is going on there in that five-college area.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
