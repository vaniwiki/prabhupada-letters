My dear Ramesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 24, 1974. There is no need of changing the signatures. It is all right that Jayatirtha continue signing checks jointly with you for normal business matters that have been approved by the trustees. So let it go on.

Your report of the book distribution there is very encouraging. Make program to distribute our books all over the world. Our books are being appreciated by learned circles, so we should take advantage. Whatever progress we have made, it is simply to distributing these books. So go on, and do not divert your mind for a moment from this. I have full confidence in you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
