My dear Gururaj,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Sept. 21, 1976. Thank you very much for the donation you have sent, it is very nice.

Please continue to associate with the devotees at our Montreal temple. If you are serious and willing to follow the four regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds daily, you are welcome to live in our Montreal temple. Make an end to this material existence once and for all. There is nothing but suffering in this material world and we are offering the chance for eternal, blissful life. Kindly take advantage of this opportunity.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
