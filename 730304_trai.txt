My dear Trai das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice report dated the 20th of february and I have carefully examined the contents. Your plans for increasing book distribution are very good. If so many books are being sold then very soon we will be finished the second edition. Distribution of all these books is making a firm basis for our movement.

The educated gentleman you mentioned who has now become a nice devotee should develop into a very good preacher. Your policy of encouraging his chanting is good, gradually Krsna consciousness is developed, that is natural.

That London doctor that Kesava mentioned to Rupanuga Maharaja is bogus. Depend on Krsna and consult a general doctor. Nobody can guarantee life. It is a little hellish but without\\
Krsna nobody can be a saint or relieved from distresses.

Regarding Pyari Mohan, Ramacarya, and Nanda devi dasi taking second initiation, if you recommend, that's alright. But now they must keep very clean and never break the regulated principles. Purity is the force and if the people in general notice that we are clean both inside and outside that is to our credit. Regarding your last question, yes, you may call Their Lordships Radha-Gopivallabha.

Now I have enclosed three sacred threads duly chanted by me. In Rupanuga Maharaja's absence, you may obtain a tape and instructions from Bali Mardan Maharaja in New York and hold one fire sacrifice.

Hoping this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher.\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
