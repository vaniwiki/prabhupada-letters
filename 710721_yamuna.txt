My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind letter dated 2nd July, 1971 and I have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear that you have visited Vrindaban and that my manuscripts are safe under lock and key and that the old business transaction files have all been burned. Thank you very much.

Yes, it is encouraging news that J. Dalmia is favorably inclined toward giving us land in Raman Reti. So let me know when things are finalized. Also two sets brass Deities were promised by the trust. What has happened to them? Another nice news is that all of you women are going out daily for preaching. Very good. Continue it whole heartedly.

Yes, Krishna may wear dhoti: why not? So far as naming the Deities in London, that I will see to when I go there, sometime in the first week of August.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
