My dear Spiritual Sons,

Please accept my blessings. As you have been recommended by Chakravarty Das for initiation, I beg to accept you both as my disciples. Now I have named you Nikhilananda Das for Niko, and Vaidyanath Das for Erland. So you now chant Hare Krishna mantra on your beads at least 16 rounds daily and try to commit any offence against the holy name. In this way you will get spiritual strength for preaching the glories of the holy name to the people. Another thing is that you should follow our the four rules of no intoxication, no illicit sex life, no meat fish, or eggs, and no gambling. This will keep you fit.

I hope this meets you in best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
