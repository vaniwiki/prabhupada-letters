Madame Sangupta,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your Bengali letter dated 29-12-74 and have noted the contents. The grievances of family life are always the same everywhere. There is nothing new in your case. I am very glad you have taken shelter there at our Detroit temple. You can remain there without any hesitation and learn how to become a devotee. We have no Bengali books. All of our books are in English, but you can chant always Hare Krishna and follow the rules and regulations and this will help you in the advancement of spiritual life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
