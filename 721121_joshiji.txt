My dear Joshiji,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter from Punjab State dated November 5, 1972, and I am very happy to hear that you have arrived in India safely and that you want to meet me. Yes, we were in Vrindaban during the Urja-vrata season, but now we are having our programme in Hyderabad until December 1st. From here I shall go to Ahmedabad for some few weeks, and from there to Bombay. I do not think we have got any programme planned for going to Punjab at present moment, but if you get opportunity to meet me at Ahmedabad or Bombay, that will be nice. Otherwise I shall be for some days in Delhi in March, but I think you are returning to California before that time. But if we get chance to meet again, I want to discuss frankly how we may co-operatively push on this Krishna Consciousness movement, especially in India. Let us see what Krishna desires.

Hoping this will meet you in good health, along with your family.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
