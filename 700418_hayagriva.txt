My Dear Hayagriva, 

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, and the contents are very much encouraging. So what you are now doing on the Bhagavad Gita manuscript is alright, do it nicely. I have got the second part of Krsna also. I want to send it to you, so when you are free let me know and I will send it.

Regarding the editing process, I am glad to know that they are improving and doing nicely, but finally you should see each manuscript before printing. That should be the arrangement.

Regarding large Deities, I am arranging for them to be sent from India already. They will be just to the standard of our London Deities, and if you can arrange for a contribution to my book fund of not less than $400, I will have one pair sent to be delivered to New Vrindaban. They will be carefully packed in first-class crates and insured, so do not worry about that. I am carrying on the complete negotiations from here.

So Kirtanananda Maharaj is planning to come here for some days and you may also come with him, and then we can go together to New Vrindaban.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
