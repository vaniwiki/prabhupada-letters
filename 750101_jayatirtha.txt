My dear Jayatirtha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of you letter dated Dec. 27th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding this matter of Spiritual Sky management, I have given the decision over to the GBC men. Whatever they decide, I will accept.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
