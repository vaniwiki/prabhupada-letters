My dear Rudra das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 3, 1969 along with your beads and contribution of $5.00. The letter head stationery is very nicely printed. Your beads have been chanted upon duly and sanctified and are returned herewith. It is very much pleasing to know that Vancouver center is improving daily. Cidananda is a very good organizing leader, Ananda is a good soul, and you are also a sincere devotee, so combinedly together push on this Krishna Consciousness Movement. Surely you will be successful. Regarding the vows and chanting method you have adopted, it is very nice. But do not impose something which will be difficult to execute. There is no need of fasting once every week. Two days fasting per month on Ekadasi is sufficient. Besides that there are other special fasting days. Spiritual realization depends on austerities and vows, but in this age, by the Mercy of Krishna and Lord Caitanya, we need not undergo very severe penances, as we are unable to do it. The rules and regulations which we have already prescribed, that is sufficient for ordinary men. But as you have increased the chanting of beads to 25 rounds daily, that is very nice.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
