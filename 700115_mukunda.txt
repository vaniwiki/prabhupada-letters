My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10 Jan., 1970, and it understood that the St. Giles in the Field School is available on rent. Now you have asked my instructions in this connection.

The first thing is that suppose we occupy that big house, what will happen to the present house which you have taken on lease agreement for three years? The present house being situated in a very important place, we have to think that by vacating this house we shall be losing a grand situation. Under the circumstances even though we occupy the big school house, whether we can utilize the present house or we shall keep this house as it is going on and we shall make another big attempt in that big house. So you have to consult amongst yourselves what to do in this connection.

Now before occupying the house it must be thoroughly repaired by the owner, and I see that you have made a condition to grant L8,000/ (eight thousand) for repairs. If it is thoroughly repaired then it will be a grand house for our purposes.

The next thing is if you are in a position to pay L1,000/- (one thousand) per month. So far I know your collection at present moment is at the rate of L40-50/- (forty to fifty) per day. Now if you occupy this house, whether it will be possible for you to collect more money by some device of Prasadam distribution or otherwise. The idea is to make the big establishment in the big house, you will have to collect at least L100/- (one hundred) per day by some means or other.

The next point is whether it is possible to take the house on lease with option to purchase. The price is presently fixed up at L80,000/- (eighty thousand). Now if there is some arrangement with option to purchase and we can secure the money to pay them L80,000 the money already paid to them in lieu of rent should be deducted. In this connection, a time limit may be set up within which we may be able to secure this L80,000 and pay them less the amount already paid in lieu of rent.

I think on basis of this negotiation will be alright. So far reference for bank, I have got some money for printing my books and if required I can arrange such reference from my banker. That can be arranged.

What happened to the parcels from Bombay for the manjiras in the Lloyd's Bank? If you have received the consignment you can send me one pair here. I want to see how they are.

Please inform Yamuna devi that I have her nice letter, and I shall reply it in due course. Also offer my blessings to all devotees, Janaki, Malati and all others. Ask Gurudasa to send me some pictures of the Installation Ceremony and some of them may be directly sent to Boston for publication in BTG.

Our book, __"Isopanisad,"__ is already out and you can send orders to ISKCON Books for this item. It is very nice.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have not as yet received payment from George for my Krishna book. Please let me know what happens\\
