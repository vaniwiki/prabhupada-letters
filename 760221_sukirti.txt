My dear Sukirti das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil.

Thank you for serving steadily and taking responsibility in Krishna Consciousness.

The spiritual master cannot be approached for solving marriage problems. That is not the business of the guru.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
