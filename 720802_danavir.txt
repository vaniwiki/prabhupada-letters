Portland

My dear Danavir,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Portland, undated, and I have noted the contents, along with the very nice newspaper article. I am very happy to hear that the programs there are becoming more and more improved, and that you are enthusiastic to understand the Krishna philosophy and to preach very boldly. So far financial matters are concerned, these are also important, and we should not neglect them.

I sometimes remember that when I spoke in Portland there were many Christian people there, and they were very much favorable whenever we mentioned that we were also lovers of Christ. So you may preach in that way, that we are not canvassing for people to convert or criticize, we are canvassing people that they should simply utilize their time for loving God by engaging in his devotional service, either they are Christian, Catholic, Jew, whatever. We are after God, that's all, we are servants of God. So preach like this, very simply, and hold sankirtana widely all over the city, and distribute prasadam profusely, especially to the young people and the students, and everything will be increasingly successful more and more. We have observed in Amsterdam that there are many frustrated young people and they have become very much degraded in their way of life. They will not even listen to philosophy. So it is better to concentrate on the sankirtana and get them to chant with us. If they go on chanting, eventually they will become purified. And if someone wants to understand a little philosophy, he can purchase one of our books. We have got so many big, big books. So in this spirit carry on with great enthusiastic endeavor and this will please me very, very much.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
