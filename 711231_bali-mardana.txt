My dear Bali Mardan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 15th, 1971 and have read the contents with great interest.

We purchased the press in the first place with the purpose of printing our books and magazine. But this has never really been done successfully. So I like very much your proposal to manage ISKCON PRESS. Do it all expertly and if you can get the books and magazines printed cheaper and earlier than Dai Nippon then we can have all our books printed by you. So you can stay permanently in New York for taking charge of the Press' management. I have got full faith in you, to make everything there work at the highest production level. If you can do BTG faster and more cheaply than Dai Nippon, then by all means do it. But whether Karandhara has already signed contracts with Dai Nippon? The new press sounds like a very good opportunity for us. So please let me know regularly what the press is producing and in that way I will see that things are actually developing.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have also received your letter through Gopala Krishna. I noted the contents. If Purusottama comes, please try to save this foolish boy. I like him very much; unfortunately he pretends now as the incarnation of St. Paul? Try to save him. ACB\\
