My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21st July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear that the gloomy situation mentioned with Tamala has now dissipated. If we keep to our principle of following the regulative principles and chanting of 16 rounds of beads daily, then it is a fact that Krishna will help us in every respect.

I am so glad that the neighboring ladies are coming to string garlands for the Deities. They should be given some service. That will be very good for them. So you should remain there not only for six month, but unlimited time unless we find some suitable place. By law they cannot remove us. Take help from Devanji, our good lawyer friend. And we have got many other friends; they will all help. In the meantime, I have sent my decision on the Little Gibbs Road House in my last letter dated 23rd July, 1971, which I hope you have received by now.

There is no objection to your program for book distribution. You should be able to make three or four members daily like that. Anyone can pay Rs. 100 immediately. So distribute as many books as possible by this method.

Yes, avoid corresponding with your mother. Simply offer your obeisances, but as far as possible avoid correspondence.

Yes, even an ordinary man absorbed in some other thought forgets his bodily pains and pleasures. So why not in Krishna Consciousness? I learned from an intimate friend of Stalin that he underwent surgical operation of the abdomen without any anesthetic. It was in the papers. He saw it that his own abdomen was being operated on. He was so strong minded. So when one is in Krishna Consciousness, he no more feels any bodily pains and pleasures. After all, we are not this body. But we should make progress steadily by following the rules and regulations, not making experiment. Just like Haridasa Takhur was beaten in 22 market places and he felt no pain. Prahlada was boiled in oil. So we have to take instruction from them, but not to imitate.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. While posting this letter, I'm in due receipt of you letter dated 16th July regarding a new house like a palace on Nepansy Road near the corner of Warden Rd. where a large catholic church stands. You can negotiate for this house with Mr. Chabria. It he thinks that it is worth 20 lacs, then you can consider this point and let me know further details to London address (7, Bury Place, London, W.C.1)
