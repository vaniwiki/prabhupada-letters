My dear Prahladananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 12, 1973.

I am enclosing herewith the sacred threads and Gayatri Mantras as requested by you. Hold a fire sacrifice amongst yourselves and prepare a nice feast and distribute to the devotees.

Yes that is nice that you are distributing many books. I do not want money, or buildings or anything else, I simply want to see that my books are being distributed and because you are doing that I am quite happy.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
