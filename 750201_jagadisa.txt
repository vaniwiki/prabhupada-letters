My dear Jagadisa das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 1-1-75 and have noted the contents. This problem that you have presented is not the kind of thing to present before the spiritual master. You should try to approach your GBC man, Jayatirtha prabhu in this matter. I am requesting again and again that all of my disciples simply follow all of the rules and regulations very strictly. Rising early, chanting 16 rounds, attending mangala arati and class, etc. are all essential for spiritual development.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
