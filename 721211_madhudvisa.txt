My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of you telegram from Melbourne, Australia requesting to name Sanauk's new girl-child. They may name her Bhakti Moti dasi. Now I have not heard from you any report in so long time. Why you are silent? You had invited me to come there this winter, but I have not heard anything definite program from you; therefore, I am unable to chalk out any plan where I shall be going in the near future. But I think there is sufficient programs here in India. I need not require to come there, they want me to come also to Calcutta and other places during February month. So I do not think there will be time to go so far to Australia and then return to India for only two, three weeks. But let us see what Krishna desires. If you have got some plans for my coming there, you may let me know also. You can correspond with Syamasundara in this connection.

Another thing is, I can understand there is some great difficulty in New Zealand temple, that boy Tusta Krishna has telephoned to Bombay that he must soon leave from there and he is having trouble in so many ways, so I have sent Siddhasvarupananda there to help him, and you may also go there at once and work cooperatively to try to rectify the situation. I am very much worried the whole thing will collapse if Tusta Krishna must go away. You go there and send me full report. There is such good potential. I like that place very much, it will be great disaster if things are in confusion. Especially you should try to approach the government authorities who are against us and try to pacify them and convince them about our Krishna Consciousness movement.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
