My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4th June, 1970, along with the enclosed photostat of the new masthead for "Back to Godhead." Thank you very much for this. It is very nice.

One of our friends, Sri Sarafji, Chief Editor of the "Godarsana" magazine, has requested some photographs for an article which is to be published in the "Godarsana." Please send therefore some negatives of pictures of Sankirtana, Deities, and some other pictures of our devotees and temples to the following address:

Sri Tarachand Saraf

Chief Editor: "Godarsana"

11-7 Kalakar Street

Calcutta-7, India\\
Please send these negatives by Air Other mail as soon as possible.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
