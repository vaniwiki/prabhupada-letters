Bombay

Dear Mr. Mukherjee,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 6th July, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

I am returning to Bombay by August 14th, 1976, when I shall be glad to see you in our Juhu Temple and talk in detail about this scheme.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
