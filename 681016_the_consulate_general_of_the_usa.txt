RE: MY APPOINTMENT ON OCT. 25, 1968, AT 9.30am

Dear Sir,

With further reference to your letter No. MTL-V-14 (CAN)10’C dated October 4, 1968, I beg to inform you that my request to transfer my file to your Vancouver office, as I did on October 10th and 11th, may be ignored as I am coming to see you at Montreal in order to keep my appointment as above mentioned, fixed by you.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
