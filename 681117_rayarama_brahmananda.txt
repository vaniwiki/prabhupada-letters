My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Nov. 12, 1968, and I thank you very much for the copies of Back To Godhead, no. 20. It is very nice. Please send the copies very quickly to different centers. I have received letters from Hawaii also that they are eagerly awaiting the consignment of Back To Godhead.

Another important point is that you can enlist the following name for sending complimentary copies of Back To Godhead.

Niranjana Samanta, Assistant Teacher

Harasankar Garkilla

Santamayi Higher Secondary School

P.O. Harasankar

Dist. Midnapur

West Bengal, INDIA

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Note to Brahmananda:

I understand from the letter of Satsvarupa that they have received a Pair of Radha Krishna murti from India, sent by Jaya Govinda, and they want to worship the Deities so you can send him the necessary instructions how to do it.

P.S. The current issue of Back to Godhead is better than all previous ones. So you are tangibly improving the quality of BTG. May Krishna bless you improve it more & more. Tamala sold yesterday 87 copies at a length. He is very much satisfied with this issue. Hayagriva is also doing nicely at Columbus fighting against Frog Philosophy.
