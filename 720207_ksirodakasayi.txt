My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of 30th January, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. the Bombay office has not yet received the 2000 copies of your latest Hindi BTG---why it is belated? they have not received even the consignment way-bill. So how many thousands have been printed, and how they have been distributed? Last month I sent you Rs. 4000/= in favor of Radha Press. So you have already collected some money by selling Hindi BTG in Jaipur, so did you send this money to Book Fund Account? Rohininandana was ready to go to you, but you have sent news through Gurudasa that because he was not too much anxious that he is not needed. But if Rohininandan's assistance is required he can join you, I have no objection. For financing this publication department of Hindi language, side by side recruiting Life Members must be done. I have written a letter in this connection to Ramananda, and a copy is enclosed herewith. His proposal is that Hindi publishing department should be done by you and Ramananda without any interference by other Foreign members. So I quite agree with this, but at the same time financial arrangements must be done as the others are doing to maintain different departments. As you know our only financial strength is recruiting Life Member, so this also must be done by you. I think both you and Ramananda will come to Mayapur to fix up the programme so that no interference will be done by the foreign members as suggested by Ramananda. I have no objection to this point.

I would further request you to secure the Vrindaban Land, either from Mr. Saraf or from the Municipal Chairman as they have promised and I wish also that this Hindi department, as well as Vrindaban department may be managed by you and Ramananda cooperatively.

Rohininandana, if required, he can join you immediately. If you require some other assistants that also will be given to you, but I wish that this Vrindaban department and the Hindi publishing department, you become in charge and do the needful.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
