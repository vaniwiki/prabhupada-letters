Dear Brisakapi dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter of Jan. 2nd and have noted the contents. It is good news that you have started a center in Bloomington. Go on chanting Hare Krsna and immediately Krsna will help you. Sex indulgence is not good; it is grossly material and we have to surpass it. But when one has staunch faith in Krsna, he'll be able to transcend the urge. Now you will be able to chastise your sex dictation. You are determined, so Krsna will help you.

This prasadam distribution is very important. Do it nicely. Our main programs are distributing prasadam and sankirtana.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
