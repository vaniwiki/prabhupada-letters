My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of July 31, 1969, along with Arundhati's letter, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the Remington typewriter typeface, it is better to purchase an original __Bhagavatam__ from India and cut the slokas out and paste them appropriately. You can get for one dollar two small books of __Bhagavatam__ published by Gita Press, and if you cut out the slokas in this way, the question will be finished. So if by spending $5.00 we solve the question, why should we spend $500.00 or $600.00? If you like the idea, I shall order these __Bhagavatams,__ or you can ask Mr. Vora to bring with him the Gita Press edition in two small copies and in "black type." This will save much time and money.

So far I have not heard anything from Mr. Vora. We want from Bombay one good order supplier of all kinds of goods from Bombay, and a good shipping agent. So far as payment is concerned, I shall arrange it that as soon as the shipping documents are delivered to the bank, the bank will pay immediately. So ask Mr. Vora to assist us in this respect. Regarding your idea for opening a store, don't bother with it. Let Gargamuni do it; not others. You have got more important business than selling. Both your wife and yourself are meant for publication department.

Arundhati asked me whether the two pictures she has described in her letter are bona fide. The answer is no. For a picture of Nrsimha Murti, she may refer to the one painted by Jadurani. That is very nice. You may inform Vamanadeva that I have duly received his letter of July 24th, and as soon as my time for being in New York is fixed up I shall inform him.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
