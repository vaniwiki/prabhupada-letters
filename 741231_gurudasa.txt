====== Letter to: Gurudasa ======

Los Angeles

My dear Guru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated, December 28th, 1974 and have noted the contents. You also organize a party like Tamala Krishna's and preach like that. I like that-more of preaching. If Yamuna has left you, why remain as grhastha? Better take sannyasa like Tamala Krishna Gosvami. I know Yamuna has Krishna in her heart. She'll not be spoiled, but let her have some temporary independence and be more Krishna Conscious. I am glad you have sent the money to India that you have collected. Now, you left Vrndavana on account of Yamuna, but she has left you there also, although you wanted to live with her. Anyway, try to forget all this material attachment and try to be attached to Krishna more and more. Actually, I want many parties like the party of Tamala Krishna and Visnujana, and they can preach all over---USA especially. So, Tamala Krishna has attained experience in this type of preaching work, so you also take advantage of this experience. If you like, you can stay with him for some time. If you can preach there, it is better that you remain in USA. Vrndavana will be managed somehow or other.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
