My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter from Calcutta dated July 24, 1972 wherein you inform that you have obtained visas to travel to China, Vietnam, Korea, and other places in the far east. That is a very nice proposal. You can join our Sudama Vipra Swami in Manila and give him good assistance there and in other places like Hong Kong. Kindly keep me informed how you are getting on by your travelling and preaching work.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
