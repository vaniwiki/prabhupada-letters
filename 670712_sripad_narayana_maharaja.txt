My Dear Narayana Maharaj,

Please accept my dandabats. I thank you very much for your letter dated July 3, 1967. I am very pleased that you have so kindly dispatched the books from Delhi. I am now staying at the following address:

C/o Budes Paradisio\\
Alamed Patio\\
Stinson Beach, California

I have come here for recuperating my health. It is a very nice place. The building is most aristocratic, and just situated on the sea beach, Pacific Ocean. I hope I shall be able to get sufficient strength here and I expect to return to India by the next month of September.

I understand that you have already spent Rs. 402 out of Rs. 2235, so out of the balance you can spend as follows: to the Vrindaban Gosain, I wish to pay him Rs. 100 in kind. That is to say you can purchase some rice, dahl and wheat worth Rs. 100 and deliver them for sevapujah of Sri Radhadamodar. But if grains are controlled and you cannot purchase on open market, then you can pay him cash Rs. 50, and take a receipt from him. You can also keep with you Rs. 50 to be paid to him at the rate of Rs.5 per month until I return. I think until I return you can go to Vrindaban once in a month, and get my rooms cleaned by Sarozini and pay him Rs. One for cleaning and taking care of my outside veranda. So, you can spend your coming and going charges, pay to Gosain Rs. 5 and to Sarozini Rs. one per month. After this expenditure the balance remains Rs. 1733.

If Vinodkumara has secured his passport and "p" form, then let him purchase two best harmoniums. I think he can purchase from Dwarkin and Sons at the cost of 556 Rs. each. So, get one bank draft for Rs. 1110 in favor of Messers Dwarkin and Sons, Esplanad, Calcutta, payable in Calcutta, and let Vinodkumar take this draft deliver to Messers Dwarkin and Sons and take delivery of two harmoniums. Out of the balance money he can take Rs. 75 for his going to Calcutta for some pocket expenses on the ship. From the balance money he can purchase sitar and tampoura from Calcutta according to his choice. I think this arrangement will be approved by us all.

I am very much eager to return to India for a change, but at the present state of health it is not possible. Vinodkumar must bring the medicines while he is coming here.

I have sent $ 100, that is Rs. 750, to Trivikram Maharaj for purchasing khole and kartal. Vinodkumar must go to Nabadwip while going to Calcutta and take delivery of the khole and kartal. All these things must be very nicely packed and brought with him as his personal luggage. I thank you very much once more for the trouble you are taking for me. This is all for Srila Prabhupada's service. Finally do not mind all the trouble which I give you occasionally. Let us cooperate for propagating Krishna Consciousness all over the world. The Delhi room may be kept as it is until my further advice.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
