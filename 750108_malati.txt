My dear Malati devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the fruits and vegetables. Regarding the London situation, I have asked Brahmananda Svami to go there and see what is the position. He is most probably there by now.

Please continue your service nicely as one of my elder women disciples always setting good example for others to follow.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
