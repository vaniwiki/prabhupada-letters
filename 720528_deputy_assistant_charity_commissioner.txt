Sir,

Sri Giriraja Das Brahmacari our Co-trustee has applied for the registration of The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust under the Bombay Public Trusts Act 1950. The contents of the Application are true to our knowledge and we have nothing to add to the same. No separate notice of hearing is required to be issued for us. We have no objection if the registration Certificate is issued to the Applicant.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
