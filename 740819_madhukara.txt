New Vrndavana

My dear Madhukara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 25th 1974 and thank you very much for your nice sentiments. Just as you were pleased that I was able to visit New Vrndavana, so did I also enjoy my visit to New Vrndavana. You are producing nice vegetables from the earth and ample supply of milk from the cows so what more do you want? Just chant Hare Krishna and everything will be alright.

Regarding the two twenty dollar checks that you had sent previously. It has not been recorded because of the change of secretaries. I suggest that you contact your bank whether or not the checks have been deposited and you can inform me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
