My dear Satsvarupa, Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your monthly GBC report dated December 14th, 1975. I have noted the contents carefully.

Now you and all of your men are experienced in distributing books to the libraries. If you can get our books placed in the public libraries it will be a great victory. Do whatever you think bet to make this possible. Yes, the reviews you are getting are very important. Many times I am showing them to influential gentlemen.

Everything should be done co-operatively. "Our" and "your's" are material conceptions and have no place in our Krishna Consciousness movement. If the members of our movement are unable to co-operate it will be very difficult to spread the mission of Lord Caitanya.

Gaura Nitai deities should not be taken into university classrooms. The professors and students will think we are fanatics. It is better to keep a big picture of Gaura Nitai which can be seen by everyone, rather than taking deities into a classroom.

Yes, as a Sannyasi and GBC your first duty is to read my books. Otherwise how will you preach? In order to remain steadily fixed in Krishna consciousness there must be a sound philosophical understanding. Otherwise it will become only sentiment. Whenever you find time please read my books.

Shortly we shall be introducing the system of examinations for those students who are ready for second initiation as well as sannyasa. According to the degree, devotees will be expected to read and assimilate our different books.

Our first business is this book distribution. There is no need of any other business. If this book distribution is managed properly, pushed on with great enthusiasm and determination and at the same time if our men keep spiritually strong, then the whole world will become Krishna conscious.

I hope this will meet you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
