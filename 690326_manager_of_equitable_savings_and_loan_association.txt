RE: MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT NO. L2410

Kindly note my change of address as c/o ISKCON, 518 Frederick Street, San Francisco, California 94117.

I beg to inform you also that my disciple and representative, Sriman Dayananda das Adhikari (Mr. Michael Wright), is a permanent resident of Los Angeles, so in case of need he will open my safety deposit box No. 361. So in case he opens the safety box when needed, please let me know what is the necessary formalities to be done, so that I can authorize it.

Thanking you in anticipation for an early reply,

Yours truly,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
