My dear Himavati dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of February 1, 1972, I am very much engladdened to note that you are progessing so nicely in Krishna Consciousness by teaching others. That is the system. Learn yourself and teach others, then this Movement will grow progressively. But one thing is that the highest standards of purity must be always very strictly followed. Therefore I am always encouraged that you are entrusted with instructing others in deity worship, cooking and other things. Although you are at liberty to follow your husband, that is not my point, but if you go the deity worship may be neglected and our progress will be hampered. That is my opinion, because you are in charge, but if you think you may go sometimes, I have no objection as long as the standard does not fall. In this and other matters you have to manage. You have to instruct others so they will not resent---if they resent, how things can be managed? As for the question about menstrual cycle, the only remedy is chanting. Anyone who is trained can be secretary, that is not such important position as preaching and training younger devotees from your experience. But that is up to your husband to decide if you will be his secretary. And you should not worry, he'll never be given Sannyas without your sanction. There is no question of giving him Sannyas, so why you are asking? Yo do not want separation from his good company, that's all right, my only point is, in your absence, who will manage? That is my only fear.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
