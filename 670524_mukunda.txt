My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. Since I wrote you last an important negotiation is going on in respect of purchasing a very nice house for the ISKCON H.Q. in New York. So I may not start in the beginning of the Second week of June 1967; but I am sure to reach there by the end of Second week of June 1967. I hope this will not cause any inconvenience.

I shall be glad to hear from you. Please convey my blessings to Janaki and other girls. Hope you are well,

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
