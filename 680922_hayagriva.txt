My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Sept. 16, 1968, and I think everything is going well with you, both. Yes, from the very beginning you just revise Srimad-Bhagavatam and now we shall print 12 volumes, for 12 cantos, under different names, each canto. That scheme will be nice. Regarding encroachment by Maya: There is every possibility, at every time, because we are living in the kingdom of Maya. Her influence upon us is very strong, but as indicated in the Bhagavad-gita, 7th chapter, that in spite of her very great influence over the living entities, a living entity as soon as he fully surrenders unto Krishna, the influence of Maya will no more act upon him. This is a fact. So the more we become stronger in our Krishna Consciousness, the more Maya is aloof from us.

Your poetry is nice, and I am keeping it with me for future publication in Back To Godhead. I shall send it to Rayarama in my next mail to him.

If you can write a nice short article, inviting the hippies, to take to Krishna Consciousness, and practice it in New Vrindaban, I think many sincere hippies who are looking after something genuine, peaceful, they will come. So our movement if it is introduced amongst the hippies, because so far I can understand, they are after such thing for peace of the mind. Not only for the hippies, but for everyone. Everyone is seeking after peace and happiness, but they are seeking in the material platform. That is not possible to be achieved there. One has to be elevated on the spiritual platform and then his aspiration will be fulfilled. I think you can write a nice article for publication in our Back To Godhead. Hope this will find you in good health. HARE KRISHNA.

Yours ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
