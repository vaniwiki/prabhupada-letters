My dear Phyllis Zakheim:

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 16th June, 1971 and have noted the contents. Please know it that "Nara Narayana" is a spirit soul, and not the physical body. That physical body was given by you, so it is very good that you take care of the physical side. So far I am concerned, I am giving him spiritual enlightenment, and I am taking care of that. So if you will take care of the physical side, that will compromise the situation.

Thanking you for your concern, I beg to remain

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
