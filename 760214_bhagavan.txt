My dear Bhagavan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 2.

Regarding the first volume of Srimad-Bhagavatam, your ideas are very good. Yes, print Krishna-Balarama on the front and the creation on the end pages as you have said.

The Bhaktisastri test will not be held this year, but it will be held next year.

So from your letters, I think things are going nicely, please continue. The book is also nice. Now sell them in huge quantity and print again.

Yes, it is good that you are opening a small centre in Belgium.

The boys you have recommended may be initiated. Hold a fire sacrifice and they may vow before the deity, the spiritual master and the fire that they will chant minimum 16 rounds daily and follow the four regulative principles. Their names are as follows:

Jean Jacques Poree---Yajnesa dasa\\
Bruno Vigneron---Brahma-jyestha dasa\\
Pierre Cortier---Pranesvara dasa\\
Claude Maurin---Kutastha dasa\\
Aziz Neilli---Akhilesvara dasa\\
%%______%%

Christian---Jagadvasi dasa\\
Jean Claude---Yajnabhuk dasa\\
Christian Mauvillain---Jagatsrasta dasa\\
Dairo Lopez---Devarat dasa\\
Ian Johnston---Aniha dasa\\
Christan Le Paumier---Jagannidhi dasa\\
Georges Mauvillain---Ghora dasa\\
Nestor de Guili---Niramaya dasa

The photograph of the Gaura Nitai deities is very nice and I have having the picture of the Geneva temple framed and placed on my wall.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
