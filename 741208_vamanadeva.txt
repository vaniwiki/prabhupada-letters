My dear Vamanadeva das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 24, 1974 with enclosed photograph of tulsi devi. They are growing very nicely.

Regarding monthly donations, you can send the money to either of the following accounts whichever is more convenient: 1. Bank of America, Bombay Branch, in favor of International Society for Krishna Consciousness Mayapur Vrindaban Fund A/c. 16026; 2. First National City Bank, Bombay Branch, in favor also International Society for Krishna Consciousness Mayapur Vrindaban Fund, A/c 17168.

I hope this meets you and your family in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
