My dear Dr. Ghosh,

Please accept my warm greetings and prayers for the well-being of your family. I beg to thank you for your letter dated April 14, 1977.

Yes, you are right. My gradual recovery is certainly the grace of Lord Krsna. The holy name of Krsna is the panacea for all cures to the diseases of this material existence. Suffering is due to the material body. The entire Vedic civilization is meant how to avoid taking another material body. Because it is a fact you have to take birth again, but it should not be in this material body. Whether you take birth as the Prime Minister or as a dog, there is suffering. It does not matter. Krsna consciousness is an attempt to awaken people from the slumber of deep ignorance in which they do not even know properly how they are suffering. Simply if they will follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gita, it can be possible, even for the mass of people.

I am very glad to know that your lawyer friend, Mr. Varma, is looking after the matter of the Beni Madhav Temple. That is very good, thank you. Now I am relieved that things will be done very nicely. And it will be a great opportunity for our men to go and to develop this place because Lord Caitanya visited there and therefore we are very eager to develop it.

I am not neglecting my health. I am improving gradually. The swelling is almost 80% down and there is an improvement in my appetite, and once again I am translating at night. You will be pleased that things are improving so kindly pray to Krsna that everything will be alright.

Hoping this meets you and everyone in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
