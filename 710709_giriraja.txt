My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my greetings and blessings for all of you. I am very anxious to know about Mayapur. Since I have come here I have not heard from you. I have sent one telegram to Tamala but there is no reply. So will you kindly send me a detailed report of your activities regarding Mayapur affairs? Please send me a report every week & oblige. I have requested Acyutananda Swami also to send me weekly reports. But I have not heard from him also. Please treat this letter as urgent and reply immediately.

Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
