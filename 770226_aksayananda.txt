Vrindaban

My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 15th February, 1977. So far my coming to Vrindaban, if I don't go to Manipur then I shall certainly come.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
