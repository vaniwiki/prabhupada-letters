My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18th June, 1970, and noted the contents.

Regarding the printing of Srimad-Bhagavatam, I have already advised you in my last letter dated 19th June, 1970, not to make contract. We shall continue to print Srimad-Bhagavatam chapterwise on ISKCON Press and when all the chapters are there we shall bind them together. The next book we shall print in Japan will be KRSNA volume II and maybe Bhagavad-gita AS IT IS---Revised and Enlarged Edition if composition is finished. KRSNA volume II is almost ready now.

I am so glad to know everything is going well in our Tokyo center, and Krsna will give you all intelligence how to surpass all difficulties of language, etc.; simply continue to work for Him sincerely.

Regarding the letter which you wish to send to inquiring persons, yes, if you have the return address to Boston and if Svarupa das can write replies nicely that will be better. But if there is some intricate question he must consult with Satsvarupa. Svarupa can reply in consultation with Satsvarupa, and some of the copies may be sent here so I will see how he is replying.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
