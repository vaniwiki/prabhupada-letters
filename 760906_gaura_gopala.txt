My dear Gaura Gopala (Govinda?) Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 28, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. Preaching actually done alone, that is the experience we get from the previous acaryas. Caitanya Mahaprabhu was travelling alone and with great difficulty His associates induced Him to accept an assistant.

So far foreign devotees are concerned I can bring immediately 500 devotees from foreign countries but the government will not allow them to stay. If any devotee comes he has to go back again after three months or six months, at 10,000 Rs. expenditure. Still I am struggling and whenever it is possible I am bringing foreign devotees to preach in India and as you say the Indians are cheaters even though not all of them. The majority who come and join us, it has been experienced, they are not sincere. Under the circumstances what can be done, I do not know. Even experienced devotees---perhaps you know Anand Baba---he was asked also to go as there were so many complaints against him. But one hope is there that you are publishing in the Orissan language and it is being distributed and your writing is approved by me. So if you concentrate on these literature printing matters and try to distribute as far as possible that is our great success. You can construct immediately a nice temple there but you say there is no devotees so how temple management can be executed? This is the problem. So you are conversant in the local language. If you bring some sincere souls to join you by preaching then it will be successful. Just like in Europe and America I went singlehandedly and by preaching work the boys responded and therefore we can see some light of success. Unfortunately in India this spirit is lacking. In India generally the young men are after money and woman, this is natural. They have no sacrificing spirit. That is the difference. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
