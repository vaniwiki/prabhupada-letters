Taipei, Taiwan

Dear Trivikrama Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Herewith find one letter by Sri Ballavh das. The idea appears to be very nice, but I do not know whether you have discussed with him all the projects involved. He want to open an incense business in Japan. But if he opens it in Japan, what is the use of staying at Taiwan? The whole project is for improvement of the Taiwan center and how it can be done from Japan? It appears contradictory.

But if by starting an incense business economically you become solvent to run on your center then it is good, and for this purpose I will advise Bali Mardan to give you the necessary capital on your approval. But I don't think it is practical to run a factory in Tokyo.

If something is to be done seriously then let me know if you have a branch of the Chinese bank known as the Liberty Bank. This bank has a branch in Honolulu and we have kept some money there. So please let me know if a branch of the Liberty Bank is there.

If you can establish a strong center in Taiwan as it is described in Sri Ballavh das' letter it will be a great idea. We have one branch in Moscow, if we get a branch in China, on the mainland, it will be a great achievement.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
