====== Letter to: Arundhati ======

My dear Arundhati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated "nil."

If you have got extra time, I encourage you to learn Sanskrit along with your husband. So far your movement is concerned, in pregnancy, you should strictly not ride on cars or any conveyance until your delivery, neither should you dance also.

So you stick to the composition work, and according to Brahmananda's program I understand you will have enough work to do now. Actually, the composition work was taken from August 1969, but still they are not yet completed. If you have no other composing work to do, then you may begin to compose Srimad-Bhagavatam, Second Canto, immediately.

Regarding the Sushruta Samhita, I have no information about this. Sushruta Samhita is a big book of medical science, it is not able to be understood by ordinary laymen. I do not know why you bother about this, but if somebody helps you from this book, I have no objection.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
