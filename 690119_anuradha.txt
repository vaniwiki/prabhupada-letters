My dear Anuradha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 14, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I am so glad to learn that you and %%___%% are well and comfortable in San Francisco. I think that your child is very nice, and Krishna has given him a great opportunity to perfect himself in spiritual life because He has placed him under the care of a mother who is a sincere devotee. Try to help him grow up peacefully in Krishna Consciousness, and Krishna will certainly smile upon you for your efforts. I am well aware that you are a good, sincere soul, so continue in this way and surely your life will be successful.

Regarding the Brijbasi picture that you sent me, the story is that when Maharaja Yudhisthira was declared king, he was performing the Rasuya Yajna ceremony. In this ceremony Krishna was elected as the President to preside over the meeting. Sisupal was a rival of Krishna, and insulted Krishna with vile words at this ceremony. Arjuna's youngest brother, Sahadeva, became so angry at this that he was ready to attack Sisupal, but he was restrained by both Krishna and Arjuna. This is the explanation of the picture.

The term Devi Dasi may be used for either married or unmarried female devotees. I thank you once more for informing me of your well-being. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
