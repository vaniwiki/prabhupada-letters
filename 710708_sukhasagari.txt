My dear Sukhasagari Devi Dasi (Candice Kellepoury),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very kind letter dated 5th July, 1971 and requesting initiation; you will be glad to know that I have gladly accepted you as my duly initiated disciple and have given you the spiritual name Sukhasagari Devi Dasi. Sukhasagari means the ocean of happiness. So always remain in Krishna's transcendental loving service and you will always remain immersed in such ocean.

I am so glad to note that you are strictly following the regulative principles of devotional life and regularly chanting 16 rounds of beads daily. Continue faithfully, because such chanting of Hare Krishna Mantra is our very strength in spiritual life and will keep you always in touch with Krishna. And soon you will be getting yourself married with Batua Gopala Prabhu (Ed), so it is your duty as his wife to help him advance in Krishna Consciousness in every respect. So if you will keep yourself 24 hours engaged in Krishna's service, then surely he will follow suit. Make Krishna the very center of your household life and work cooperatively to serve Him to the very best of your capacity. Then you will be happy and your lives will know perfection.

Yes, to please Lord Jagannatha means to go on serving Him to the best of your ability. That love is there, dormant, for Lord Jagannatha. Simply we have to revive it. Not that it is something new. Simply we have to remember. And the process is to engage whole-heartedly in His service. Then by serving, serving, that dormant love will be re-awakened and then one day Jagannatha will reveal Himself to you, "I am like this." And that will be perfection in Krishna Consciousness. So work for it enthusiastically.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
