====== Letter to: Bhagavan ======

Paris

My dear Bhagavan das:

Please accept my blessings. Recently at Bhaktivedanta Manor they have held one election for President and Hansadutta was present. But I am receiving so many contradictory reports as to what was the outcome. So I have advised them to again hold election with all members present, and I request you to go there to see what is the outcome of the election.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
