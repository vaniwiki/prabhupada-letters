My dear Madam Surati Morarji:

Thank you very much for your kind reception. The present immediate problem is that we require the Police Commissioner's consent to construct a temple. The papers are already there in his possession, and it is understood that if some important Minister recommends immediately the matter will be solved.

So you kindly give immediately a note to the Finance Minister Mr. Choudhury so that Giriraja will go tomorrow morning early to see the Minister. So kindly give your note immediately to Giriraja because the time is very short. We have to get it done before this Tuesday next. So give a strongly recommended note and oblige.

Thanking you.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
