My dear Hayagriva and Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for sending me the poster with pictures of Mr. Ginsberg and myself. It is very nicely done. Now on that I shall lead the kirtana. I shall first of all chant, and our devotees should respond as usual. And with the devotees Mr. Ginsberg will also be amongst our devotees, and the public will be requested to follow this response. In this way there shall be kirtana performance for at least half an hour. For our men I want four mrdangas and twelve karatalas or cymbals. If Kirtanananda can play the harmonium melodiously along with the chanting, it will be nice. If somebody can play the tamboura, that will be still more nice. But they should be rhythmically played. So I do not know how many devotees are there or how many mrdangas are there, but we will require four mrdangas. If this is deficient now in men or mrdangas, then you should arrange for that by calling New York men and Buffalo men. Recently I have made one record in Los Angeles, so in trying to train our men in that rhythm is not difficult. Just arrange for sixteen men; four mrdangas, harmonium, tamboura, and the rest playing karatalas. If we can perform kirtana following the recently made recording, it will be marvelous. The summary is that you should make the above preparations for when the advertised meeting is held.

I will be reaching there in Columbus on United Airlines at 10:47, so in the evening if there is an engagement, we can accept. I will not be tired. On the 9th, 10th, 11th, if you want you can make some programs. On the 12th it is already scheduled, and similarly, on the 13rd and 14th you may make arrangements. On the morning of the 15th I shall be going to North Carolina.

On the engagement with Mr. Ginsberg, after the first kirtana with me leading, then Mr. Ginsberg may speak something about the Sankirtana Movement. You can also speak about it, and then I shall give the concluding speech, or if someone else wishes to speak you can arrange for this. After the speaking there will be kirtana in the same way. But if you so desire, Mr. Ginsberg can lead this last program and all the others shall respond. I think this will be nice program.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
