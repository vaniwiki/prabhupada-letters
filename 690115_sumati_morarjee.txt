Madam Sumati Morarji Baisaheba,

Please accept my greetings. I hope everything is going well with you. You will be pleased to know that this year two of my books have been published. They are as follows

(1) __The Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ Published by MacMillan Company of New York and London

(2) __Teachings of Lord Caitanya__ Published by International Society for Krishna Consciousness

The first book is already received in stock, and the second is expected next month.

I have the greatest pleasure to present to you the first one sending by separate air mail, and I shall be glad to hear from you how you like it.

Yours in the service of the Lord,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
