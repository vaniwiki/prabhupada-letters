My dear Ajita das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 8/18/74 and the contents have given me much pleasure. You have given me all happy news. The festival success is very encouraging to me. So go on with your festivals. Everyone will like this movement, it is such a nice thing, what Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has given. You have captured the essence, and therefore you are successful in being able to distribute it to the people of Sweden. I am very glad that I have got such good disciples as you.

The program is already there, publish my books and distribute to your best capacity. Yes, every town and village, that is what Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted. Krishna will bless you for your sincere effort.

The price for the property you have mentioned is very cheap. You should purchase it. It is very nice that there is water all around it. Certainly I will take the first opportunity and shall go there to visit you to see how you are doing.

You have the intelligence how to execute this mission. That I see. Remain sincere and fixed up and enthusiastic by following the rules and regulations and chanting 16 rounds. Then you will remain spiritually strong. Then maya cannot disturb you.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
