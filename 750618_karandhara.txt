My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6/9/75 and have noted the contents. Any position we remain in, we must have full dependence on our spiritual life.---chanting 16 rounds daily, following the four regulative principles, etc. This will maintain our spiritual strength. And if we maintain our spiritual strength, then anywhere we live, we live under the protection of Krishna. A Narayana-para or a person who is fully surrendered to Narayana is not afraid to live even in most dangerous place. He is always safe, under the protection of Narayana.

To help the preaching work, that is also preaching. If you can get money to help expand our preaching activities, that is preaching. We require money. Laksmi is the immediate assistant of Narayana. Narayana is always preceded by the word Laksmi. The Mayavadi philosophers do not touch laksmi, but we accept for the service of Krishna. We are not of the mentality of Ravana who took Laksmi from Narayana and became ruined. Keep Laksmi and Narayana always together and you will become as powerful as Hanuman. He is always worshiped along with Lord Rama and Laksmi-Sita. There are many temples of Hanuman in India.

Regarding investing money there in Iran, I have no objection if it is kept in Atreya Rsi's name. He is one of our men. Please send the complete details in this connection and I shall decide.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
