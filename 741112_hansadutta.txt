My dear Hansadutta das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 11, 1974 and also the new German books KRSNA, TLC, and LIFE FROM LIFE, and also the record "Krsna Meditation." I thank you very much. It is all very nice. May Krsna bless you with more and more publishing work. I am always thinking of your Frankfurt Schloss center. The songs which I have recorded there I have heard today on the record, and they are very nice, especially the "Prayers to the Six Goswamis." It has come out very successful on the whole. I hope the German people will like the Bengali tunes. What is the report of how they are selling?

Whenever you call me for coming there I shall come. Never quit the Frankfurt palace. It is very nicely situated, in a open place. The landlord is a good gentleman, so keep good relations with him and his wife.

The report that the newly published books are all selling like mad is very, very encouraging. Now publish more books. Make more translations. You have not yet published Bhagavatam and also Krsna Book Second Part. Is this translated or not? And what about "Leben Kommt Von Leben?" Are they also selling? I have never studied science, but I am challenging them. They may take me as crazy, but I am not crazy. I am right.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
