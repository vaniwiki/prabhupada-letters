My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th November, 1970 and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, I have received a copy of the GBC meeting held in Pittsburgh and I hope that all of you GBC members will continue your present course of action. Always be acting for Krishna. Krishna Consciousness means to be alive, not that if we get some time, we lay down and sleep. So your activities and reports are all encouraging to me, so please continue in this way. Also continue placing my books in libraries, colleges, bookstores, etc. and gradually the public will learn to appreciate this stock of transcendental literature. People are accustomed to read all kinds of rubbish literatures. The principle is there---reading. We simply have to direct their attention to Krishna.

Regarding Pradyumna, he can train some local man for assistance, but I don't think it is possible to send anyone from here at this time.

Narottamananda and Susan may be married accordingly and I will be pleased to give my blessings.

I hope this will find you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
