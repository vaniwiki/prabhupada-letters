My dear Hansadutta Maharaja;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 24, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. You should carry on your sankirtana movement; you are fit for that. Wherever you like you can make your Hq.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
