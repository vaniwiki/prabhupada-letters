My dear Madhusudana Da,

Please accept my humble obeisances. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your Bengali letter dated 24th March, 1971 and I have noted the contents carefully. In reply to this letter I would draw your attention to "Caitanya Caritamrta," verse no. 23, 10th chapter, Madhya lila and its explanation, given by Srila Prabhupada in His __Anuvhasya.__

Of course I am very busy with my work. Still I shall be glad to answer all your questions in this regard, After reading the Anubhasya explanation given by Srila Prabhupada. In the meantime, if possible, kindly explain what you mean by Visnupad and what you mean by Prabhupada.

I shall be here until the 5th April, 1971 and our program in Cross Maidan is going on very satisfactorily. Every day more than 15,000 to 20,000 people assemble and especially today it was very much crowded.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
