Dear Shri Pattanaik,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21-2-77 and have noted the contents.

We have already started one Temple project and we are raising funds for this purpose. Unless this temple is finished in Bhubaneswar we cannot take any new project.

In this connection you can see our representative, Sriman Bhagawat das Brahmachary. I am forwarding your letter to him so you can discuss with him whether it is possible to do anything.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
