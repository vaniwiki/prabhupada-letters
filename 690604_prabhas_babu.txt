Dear Prabhas Babu:

In further reference to my last letter sent in reply to your letter dated April 2, 1969, I am surprised that the packages sent by Jaya Govinda das Brahmacari as well as those sent by Atma Ram & Sons have not yet been sent. You acknowledged that these goods are ready to be shipped in your letter of April 2, 1969, but you have still not shipped them. I could understand that there was a delay on account of Pibhuti Babu's disappearance, but why are they still delayed? Please let me know why the shipping of our goods is so tremendously delayed. Kindly treat this letter as very urgent, and let me know why my goods have not been shipped yet.

As I have been informed by Jaya Govinda das Brahmacari, you are holding the following items:

Package 1. one pair of 10 1/2" brass R-K Murtis with jewelry and clothing

Package 2. one pair of 13" brass R-K Murtis with jewelry and clothing

Package 3. one mrdangam

Package 4. one harmonium---with double reeds, with 7 stops, full cover

Package 5. 30 cartons incense, each carton containing 12 boxes

Package 6. 1,400 Assorted Brijbasi pictures

8 dozen Assorted brass incense holders

2 dozen red candana malas

50 odd __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ prospectus

16 __Easy Journey To Other Planets__\\
and personal effects amounting to 3 pairs brass cymbals, 4 old copies of __Back To Godhead__ 8 wooden incense holders, 5 tubes incense, 7 tulsi malas from Vrindaban with kuntis and counter beads, regular items for performance of puja namely, conch, 5-light lamp, incense holder, cup and spoon, one set of __Srimad-Bhagavatams,__ notes, etc. In addition, 8 bundles of books were sent to you by Atma Ram & Sons, containing __Srimad-Bhagavatam,__ Vol. One---104 copies, Vol. Two---110 copies, Vol. Three---46 copies.

I am awaiting your early reply.

Sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
