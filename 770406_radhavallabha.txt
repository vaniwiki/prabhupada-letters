My dear Radhavallabha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated March 29, 1977.

The photographs you have sent are all excellent. I have ordered them to be mounted and hung in various places in the temple. Thank you very much.

Just now I am not completely fit but as soon as I become fit I shall write an introduction to the Kapila Book.

Yes, try to reduce the expenditures more and more. It is only with great difficulty upon all our book distributers that BBT gets its funds. So those who are responsible should be very frugal to see that not one penny is unnecessarily spent.

Thank you all for praying to Lord Nrsimhadeva for my good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
