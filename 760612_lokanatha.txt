My dear Lokanatha Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 2, 1976 and I have noted the contents with pleasure.

I am very glad to see that you are enthusiastically pushing forward with this preaching work and the young Indians are coming forward to join our sankirtana party. It is very encouraging to me. Anyone who has life he can preach, so go on very enthusiastically and there will be all facility given by Lord Krishna.

On your recommendation I am accepting the following devotees for initiation:

1st initiation: Bhakta Adhira whose spiritual name is Abhayasraya-dasa

2nd initiation: Dharanidhara das Brahmacari, Vrajesvara das Brahmacari,

Enclosed please find a copy of gayatri initiation and two brahmana threads. After the yajna, the brahmana initiates should hear the gayatri mantra in the right ear. The devotees must all bear in mind that they are promising to follow the four regulative principles, i.e., no illicit sex-life, no intoxication, no gambling, and no meat-eating, and also chanting a minimum of 16 rounds of japa daily. This promise is made before the spiritual master, before the Deity, the devotees, Vaisnavas, the Supersoul, and the fire. Everyone should take very seriously this vow and make steady and sure progress in Krishna Consciousness and go back to home, back to Godhead in this lifetime.

When I return to India, I shall surely try to travel with your buses. It is a very nice program and I want to see it go on very enthusiastically. I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
