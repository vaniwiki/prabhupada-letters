Los Angeles

My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 24, 1968, and I thank you very much for all the nice news. I am so much pleased to learn that the Los Angeles temple is improving in opulence. Please tell Janaki that I am so glad to learn that she has framed the pictures very nicely and that both she and Mukunda are working to improve the condition of the temple. This is all very nice.

Yes, the idea to make S.F. our headquarters, that is in my mind, but that church is not yet settled. The man is prolonging it. Actually, if you get the church I shall make that my headquarters, and I shall come there to your temple occasionally. How is Sankarsana and Baladeva. I have not heard anything from them.

I have ordered one half dozen mrdangas to be dispatched to San Francisco port, so you will have good opportunity to take procession of Sankirtana with 2 or 3 mrdangas, karatalas, etc.

Regarding the Radha Krishna statues, for the time being, suspend it. Keep Them dressed nicely, as Janaki is doing. I have received the second transcribing set. On Wednesday, May 1, I am going to Boston, where there are so many nice college engagements arranged. Just recently we went to Philadelphia, to Temple University, where we held kirtana and lecture very nicely. And for our transportation and lecture they paid us $150.00; similarly, tomorrow we have got engagement at New York University at Stoney Brook, Long Island, and they are paying us $200.00 for our coming there. So we are spreading this Sankirtana very nicely here also. Please keep me informed of all your activities there, and hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
