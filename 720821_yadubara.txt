My dear Yadubara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 10, 1972. Regarding printing BTG Hindi in India your scheme to print them in Bombay is accepted by me. So you do the needful being contact with Ramananda.

Regarding Bhaktivinode Thakura's manuscripts, immediately we do not have any program for printing them. You keep them carefully and when I return I shall consider the matter. The translating work can be done both by Ramananda and Niranjana in Benares.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
