My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated September 27, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am greatly relieved to hear from you that the bank is likely willing to loan us Rs. 5 lakhs or Rs. 10 lakhs. That is the ideal solution. Best thing is to take loan. We have paid two lakhs, so take twelve lakhs from bank and finish the business. That will be nice. Otherwise, we shall go to the court with lawyer and get out a criminal case against him. That is the lawyers business. Take loan and give him, that is the best solution.

We want to keep that land, we do not want to break the agreement, therefore I have formed this committee. Actually we are in possession of the land, and we shall remain there. Now if we have to take Mr. Nair to criminal court, and supposing it will take years to settle, still, we can occupy and carry on as we are doing. But if you can prove to the municipal officers that we are legally in possession of the land according to sales agreement, why they shall not give permission to build?

We must have that land, and on the terms of the purchase agreement. Otherwise we shall bring him to the criminal court. We are in possession of the land in legal terms, so even the government cannot take it. We can give Mr. Nair this much concession, the five lakhs worth, but it must be deducted from the purchase price. Otherwise, we shall not give any concession we shall go to the courts. You consult the lawyers. The committee is there, I want that the land should be purchased, that's all.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Syamasundara is in London now for settling up the London house, and he will fly to Bombay very soon on his way to meet me in Delhi, so why not take his help to finish this business?\\
