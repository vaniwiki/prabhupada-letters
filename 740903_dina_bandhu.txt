My dear Dina Bandhu dasa Adhikari:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 15, 1974 and have noted the contents. Upon your recommendation I have accepted as my initiated disciples the following devotees and their names are:

1. Ed---Edhaniyasvabhava das

2. Pat---Pati das

3. Linda---Lila devi

Also enclosed are sanctified threads for Mahi Barta das, Krta krta das, Sarva das, Sretha das, Now hold a fire sacrifice and impress upon the devotees that they are taking vows before Radha and Krsna, the spiritual master, and the Vaisnavas. Everyone should attend mangal arati and chant 16 rounds daily.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
