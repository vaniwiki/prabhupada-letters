====== Letter to: Randas Agrawal ======

My dear Randas Agrawalji,

Please accept my greetings. Since I've come to Surat I've not heard from you. I hope everything is going well with you.

Out of the many life members, Maharaja Bharatasingh gave one check numbered 0011644 from the State Bank of Indore and this is now returned with remark "refer to Drawer." This is the first time that we've got such experience. I am therefore handing over the check which is enclosed. Kindly see the Maharaja Bharatasingh and if he'll kindly pay us cash it will be very much appreciated. In realization of the cash, kindly deposit it in the Central Bank of India, Indore Cloth Market Branch, for mail transfer to the head office in favor of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Please let me know what action you have taken in this connection. You can write our Bombay address as given above. I am going to Bombay tomorrow.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
