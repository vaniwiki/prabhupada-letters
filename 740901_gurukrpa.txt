My dear Gurukrpa Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 27, 1974 and have noted the contents. I note that you have remitted for M-V total of $185,807.00. You say that after this last payment to Dai Nippon, you will not be able to send any legal payment out of the country. But, Ramesvara has just written that after this payment you will be able to make all future payments to my account direct. Please clarify this. But, there are Indian merchants there who can help you. If they understand that we are using the money here to build temples, they will help. You must use your best judgement. What can I advise?

Regarding the allurements of money and women, Krsna will protect you. Caitanya Mahaprabhu at a young age took sannyasa and Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya was also thinking like you are thinking. So as a friend Sarvabhauma wanted to teach Caitanya Mahaprabhu Vedanta. The result was that Bhattacarya had to learn Vedanta from Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and became his disciple. So Krsna is always strong. If you are fully engaged in Krsna's service attraction of women will be a myth only. It is only Krsna's grace. Of course we are old men now, but even old men they are attracted still by women. So even old man or young man, if one's mind is fixed up in Krsna's lotus feet, there will be no such mundane attraction. Even a woman in the dead of night with all attractive features could not affect even sligtly Haridasa Thakura. So it is a very pleasant job transcendentally. So much so that women and money is no attraction to a devotee. A devotee knows how to engage himself and others in the service of Krsna completely, as well as all the wealth of the world in the matter of propagating Krsna consciousness. Rest assured.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
