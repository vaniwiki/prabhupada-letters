Dear Sir,

Please withdraw the sum of forty five hundred English Pounds Sterling (4,500 Pounds) from the above mentioned account and transfer it to the account of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Hare Krishna Society) in your branch, and advise me that you have done so.

Thanking you,
