My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I am duly in receipt of your letter of Oct. 16, 1968, from San Francisco. You have asked my permission whether you can stay in San Francisco, but I think your service will be required in Los Angeles. The Sankirtana party is going to Los Angeles very soon, and I shall decide about you when I go there. In the meantime, you stay in San Francisco, and help Cidananda as secretary.

Regarding Dr. Bagchee---we must always know that we are executing the topmost yoga system, Krishna Consciousness, and we do not require any inferior quality yoga system. You must have read in Bhagavad-gita in the 6th chap., last verse, that one who is constantly in Krishna Consciousness, he is the topmost yogi [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]]. So the process which we have adopted cannot be compared even with any other yoga system. That is a fact.

Hope this meets you in good health, and more when we meet.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
