====== Letter to: Karandhara ======

Encino, California

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 1, 1974. I am glad to hear that you are agreeable to and making plans to come and join with me. Everyone has some potency. You have special potency. Do not waste it in the service of maya, but use it in the service of Krsna. Although there is inconvenience, we must endure it with a vow and finish our business in Krishna conscious service. As for you joining me, the following is my schedule; I will be leaving India on May 23 for Rome where I will be going to Via Misttetta 2, near Piazza Lodi, Rome 00182. On the 30th of May I will go to Geneva, Switzerland and will be at 9, chemin du Credo 1213 Petit Lancy. And on June 9 I will be arriving in Paris and will stay in Paris for a week. After this our program is not fixed up. I may tour in Europe or travel. So I hope you will be able to join me either in Rome, Geneva or Paris. I am very eager to meet with you so please try your best to arrive in Europe while I am there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
