====== Letter to: Rupanuga ======

Warrenton, Virginia

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 3, 1974 and I have carefully examined the contents.

Yes, I could observe that your mind was disturbed on account of meeting your wife privately. There is no need of hide and seek. Better live as husband and wife as householders and in great enthusiasm execute the Krishna Consciousness movement. There are many GBC who are grhastha. you can remain for management of the temples and also work in the schools and colleges for introducing our books in the libraries. The recent reports of this work have been very favorable. Take up this line more seriously helped by your good wife and that will be nice.

I have stopped the political movement because it will not help us. It is a very filthy atmosphere. Better you do not indulge in those things with expenditure of money and spiritual energy.

So you should not consider taking sannyasa again, but in your country it is not a great thing. Although officially it is a falldown from sannyasa, in your country no one understands sannyasa. The more important principle is that we should purify our thoughts and engage them in Krsna's service. Please try to understand this important principle: being disgusted with their nasty thoughts people sometimes attempt to become thoughtless, but this is never possible. We should encourage everyone to not become thoughtless but to purify their thinking by always thinking of Krsna in the recommended ways. So I request you to go back preaching vigorously along with your wife who is also a good preacher.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
