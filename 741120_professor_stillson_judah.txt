Dear Professor Judah:

I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated November 1, 1974. I understand you have sent your book to my Los Angeles address. At present I am in India at the above address. Most probably my secretary in Los Angeles will direct the book here, and I shall read it with great interest.

I am very much pleased that you have taken our Krishna consciousness movement a little seriously. That is very good. Lord Krishna says that when the leading men of the society accept it, then it is followed by the common men. I wish the leading men of the human society may understand the background of this great movement. It is on the basis of God consciousness. Every living entity especially in the human form of life is potentially God conscious. Unfortunately the modern leaders of the society have made the common man forget God somehow or other. Our humble attempt is to revive the forgotten consciousness of the human society.

Without being God conscious you cannot expect perfection in the human society. It is said in the sastra that if a person is God conscious, then all good qualities manifest in his person, but without being God conscious no material quality can make anyone a respected gentleman. Therefore it is essential to teach God consciousness in every school, college, and university to revive man's dormant God consciousness.

I hope you will continue to cooperate with us in this attempt. Thanking you n anticipation. I shall read the book when I get it.

Yours very sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
