My dear Sacimata Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated 3rd October 1976 and I have noted the contents carefully.

There is nothing mystical about getting Gaura Nitai deities for worshiping. The Lord is all powerful and omnipresent, he knows the heart of the devotee and reciprocates with the devotee accordingly. So now the Lord has come to your home and agreed to be worshiped by you, therefore everything should be clean and neat. Nice prasadam should be offered regularly and distributed to guests. Kirtana may be performed morning and evening and some discussion from Bhagavad-gita as it is, or other books from our publications.

Your activities in Germany are all right, try to help the sankirtana and preach to your own circle of friends. I think at this time there is no need for you to come to India. If there is need I shall let you know. You are all little older and India will be difficult for you, for the time being please remain situated as you are. Chant Hare Krishna and help spread this movement in the best way open to you.

Hansadutta Maharaja has told me about you, and he is presently acting as my secretary.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
