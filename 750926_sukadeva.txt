My dear Sukdev das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 8, 1975 and have noted the contents. Yes, the girls when married to a brahmana, still they have to be recommended. She may be recommended by her husband.

Upon your recommendation I accept Sita devi for second initiation. Enclosed is the mantra sheet. She must hear the recorded tape I have given through the right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
