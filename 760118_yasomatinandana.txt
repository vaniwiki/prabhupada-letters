My dear Yashomatinandan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the names of the persons recommended for first and second initiation. I accept all the new devotees as my initiated disciples. Their spiritual names are:

Bhakta Phil---Sarvaksadasa

Bhakta Mark---Parivadi dasa

Bhakta Jimmy---Kalasamvara dasa

Bhakta Bruce---Rudracandi dasa

Bhakta Martin---Krodhesvara dasa

Bhaktin Karen---Sarvaga dasi

Bhaktin Sue---Brahmapatni dasi\\
All of them must agree to faithfully chant 16 rounds minimum daily and rigidly abide by the four regulative principles.

I accept Sriman Ram das and Sriman Dayasara das for second initiation. Their sacred threads are duly chanted on and are enclosed. Brahmin means to be clean---inside by always chanting the Lord's glories, and outside by regular bathing. Brahmin also means pandita, so they must be able to support their preaching by quoting sastric references. Particularly, they should study Bhagavad-gita, Sri Isopanisad, Nectar of Devotion and Nectar of Instruction as well as all the small paperbacks. There will be a yearly examination for all Brahmins based upon these books.

Now you must hold a fire ceremony. Afterwards, the brahmanas may hear the Gayatri mantra through the right ear from the tape recording. Teach everyone to follow the principles by your personal example.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
