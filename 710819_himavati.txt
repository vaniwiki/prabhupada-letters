My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th August, 1971 and have noted the contents.

There is no question of your falldown. Chant 16 rounds regularly and no power in all three worlds will make you fall down. Krishna will save you always. So you can live strictly like a brahmacarini and make advancement in Krishna Consciousness by chanting and reading the books. And you have got good capacity for preaching work also. There is no objection for you living together, but it is better that you live as brahmacarini.

If you want to become a teacher for the young children, that will be very nice.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
