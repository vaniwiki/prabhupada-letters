My dear Dipakji,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22 December, 1975, and have noted the contents. I am very glad to learn that you have got your M.S. degree in Industrial Engineering, so do finish your Ph D course. Krsna will bless you with a good situation for the service of the Lord.

I am glad to learn that you are daily coming to our New York temple to worship the Deity. Most probably I shall be coming to New York next April where we shall meet and talk more about spiritual progress of life.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
