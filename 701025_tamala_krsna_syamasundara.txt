Bombay

My dear Tamala Krishna and Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I'm in due receipt of your separate letters and have noted the contents carefully. The letter addressed to Ksirodakasayi has been approved by me and sent by airmail to London. I think the procedure followed by you for Bombay activities is quite nice. I was thinking of going to Delhi and Vrndavana but, as you say, that my presence in Bombay will be more beneficial. Therefore we have all reserved our seats in the Deluxe Train on 30th October, Friday. We shall start from here at 6:35 a.m. reaching Bombay central station next day 31st October, Saturday by 4:40 pm. I think I shall send you another telegram but you can take it as certain that we are starting on the 30th. On this basis you can make arrangements for meeting the respectful gentlemen and ladies mentioned by you. So far I've not received the copies of the magazines sent by Dai Nippon from Japan. I'm very glad that you are organizing the temple worship at Chembur. It will be a great opportunity to show your capacity how to worship the deity in the temple. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
