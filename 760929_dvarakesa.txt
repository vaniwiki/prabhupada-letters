My dear Dvarakesa,

Please accept my blessings. With reference to your letter to Harikesa dated 22nd inst., yes, kirtana and prasada will appeal to even the uneducated. We have means to preach to both the educated and uneducated, the sinful and the pious---dhiradhira-jana-priyau. Regarding the concerts, make mrdanga concert. You will get good mrdangas from L.A.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
