My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 30, 1969. A two-way ticket is being sent to New York for you to come to London, so you may go to New York as soon as possible and do the needful. At least if you remain so long as I am here, then we can return back together. Regarding Los Angeles business, for the time being you can entrust this to Gargamuni and Stoka Krishna. So far as corresponding with the other West Coast presidents, that can be done from here also. Here you can talk with Mukunda and others about the World Sankirtana Party. There is good possibility. Simply it requires some good organization. Therefore you are called.

So far as I am concerned, as I already told you, after this European tour I am going to retire from active work and retire for writing books. So any place suitable I shall stay and give you directions. I am now confident that at least one dozen of you have understood the philosophy and the matters by which it can be handled. So from the background if I give you some inspiration, the whole society shall run on nicely. We shall talk of these things when you come. So try to go to New York as soon as you are able, and the ticket will be duly sent there.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

PS: Address future correspondence to 7 Bury Place, London.
