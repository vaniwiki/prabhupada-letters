My dear Upendra and Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. If our Berkeley centre is not going to be fruitful just now, I think you may prepare to go to India where Acyutananda has opened a centre at Kanpur. Gurudasa is in contact with Acyutananda and you can talk with Gurudasa. Our aim of starting a centre in India is to attract Indian youngsters by American devotees. Combined together we shall be able to make a wide circulation of the Krishna Consciousness movement. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
