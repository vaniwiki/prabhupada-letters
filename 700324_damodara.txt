====== Letter to: Damodara ======

My dear Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15th March 1970, and thank you very much for the check of $30 contribution to my maintenance and book funds.\\
I am so glad to learn that your efforts to raise contributions towards a nicer temple are now meeting with some good response. Now the Washington devotees have appeared on the television several times, so the public will be inquiring more and more what is this Krsna Consciousness movement. And you say that several hundred people joined in chanting and dancing during the eclipse. All these things are very much encouraging to me. The key to your success is firm conviction combined with sincerity of purpose, then push our Krsna Consciousness movement with unflinching determination.

Do not feel inferior complexity. When Krsna will give you chance, you will do more than others are doing. But whatever you do, do it nicely in Krsna's service, and Krsna will bless you. Washington is the capitol of the U.S.A., so your center should be just befitting the position of Washington.

If sometimes you come here and see the L.A. Temple and their activities, I think you may improve in your activities.

Please offer my blessings to Madhusudana, Kancanbala, Dinesh, Visnu Arati, Denise, and all the boys and girls there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
