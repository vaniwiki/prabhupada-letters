Bombay

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I do not know where you are now, probably you are in Bombay. So, I am sending one copy to Bombay and one to Vrndavana. The Bombay dealing has been muddled by the tactis of Mr. Nair and Diwanji. Giriraja is in trouble. He is a child in these worldly dealings so immediately go to help him. The present position is that Mr. Nair wants more money. We have already paid him two lacs. So according to our purchase agreement, we require to pay him 12 lacs in 4 years. But he says that he has to pay 5 lacs to the government as tax, so he cannot pay from his own pocket. So we are prepared to pay him 5 lacs against the purchase value. So both you and Bhavananda arrange for this money from Mr. Jayan, and send advice to Karandhara by joint signature. But you must be careful to pay the money in the court (registrar's office) and not in the hand of Mr. Nair or his solicitor.

I enquired through a local lawyer why Diwanji is delaying the matter. He replied that he (Diwanji) is no longer our solicitor. So things appear to be very hazy, but we must not become the victim to the tactics of Mr. Nair and Mr. Diwanji. If things can be settled mutually even by paying 5 lacs more on the account of purchase agreement, do it and settle up the things properly, otherwise let us go to the court for specific action, either civil or criminal against the tactics of Mr. Nair.

Syamasundara has gone to London to purchase a very big palatial building about 20 minutes from central London, and George has agreed to loan L200,000. So he is engaged there, otherwise he would have proceeded immediately to India.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
