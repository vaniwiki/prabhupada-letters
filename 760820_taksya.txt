My dear Taksya das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 27, 1976 and have noted the contents.

I am pleased to accept on your recommendation Bhakta Walker for first initiation. His name will be Vayuvahana dasa. You may give him his name at a fire yajna and his beads may be chanted on by Hrdayananda Maharaja. Make sure that he is well aware of our four rules and regulations and that they are followed. Also make sure that he chants the prescribed number of rounds. Every initiated disciple must chant 16 rounds a day without fail. If one follows the rules and regulations of devotional life then he may advance very quickly on the path of devotional service.

Kindly take up the mission of spreading the message of the Lord all over the world with greater and greater enthusiasm. Preaching is our life. But in order to preach one must become firmly fixed in the spiritual practices otherwise his words will not act. It is the duty of every initiated disciple to try and please the spiritual master by rendering service and inquiring submissively. There should also be an offering of daksina whenever one presents himself for initiation.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
