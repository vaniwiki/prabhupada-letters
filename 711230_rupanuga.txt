====== Letter to: Rupanuga ======

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 12th, 1971. Unfortunately, it did not contain the two Krishna Book samples as I believe you sent them to Madras. But that does not matter, I have understood from your letter the point you wanted to make. Krishna Book should be published with the American University students in mind. Brahmananda can not send money out of Africa, so there is no need of printing a special African edition. Instead a few copies may be sent to him and he can arrange to have them copied and printed there with the Book Fund money that is in Africa. Then he can adjust the size of the book according to the African book market. So I also agree that Krishna Book of 16 color prints plus 6x9 will be very nice.

It is a fact that householders should not live in the Temple together. Whether with child or without child, householders should not live together in the Temple. Otherwise, what will the Brahmacaris and Sannyasis think? So this should be discouraged. Bali Mardan is correct in this point.

I am very encouraged by the reports of the tremendous success of your TV and radio programs. As much as possible try to increase our preaching programs by using all the mass media which are available. We are modern day Vaisnavas and we must preach vigorously using all the means available.

Hoping this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
