To Rishikumar

(cont.) .., for Krishna's service. This can be dovetailed when we are actually very sincere servant of Lord Krishna. So always try to follow this principle and there will be no scarcity in your campaign of Krishna Consciousness.

Try to manage affairs at the Temple and Sankirtana Party to the best of your capacity with the help of Bhavananda.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
