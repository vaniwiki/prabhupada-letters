Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I have received a letter from Gargamuni Swami that he has sent $20,000 to Mayapur. So why should there be scarcity of money? What are you doing with this money? Please give me your report.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
