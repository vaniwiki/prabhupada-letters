My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I hope things are going on in New York very nicely, but I have not heard from you since coming here. On the plane I had no inconvenience, and I ate all the puris brought by Kirtanananda. Sometimes on the way there was little jerking (air pockets) and I got little nervous. Anyway I got down safely and was received by the anxious devotees here. Jayananda in a nice car brought me to the house, which is situated in an exceptionally nice spot, and the house itself is aristocratic. So there is nothing to complain about the house and place. The only difficulty is that I cannot go to the temple on account of the zig-zag course of the road in crossing the mountains. Anyway, the devotees are coming here, and the Rathayatra Festival was performed with great pomp. More than 500 people followed the procession to the beach, and there were about two dozen cars. They distributed thousands of capatis, and at last Sri Jagannatha, Subhadra, and Baladeva. kindly came here in our house and will stay here for one week and then return.

So for my health is concerned, on the whole it is nice, but sometimes I feel not so good. Everything depends on Krishna, and as He desires it will happen.

Dvarakadhisa has informed me you have received one letter from the Japanese printers. I am very anxious to see the letters. You can direct my mail to:

I shall be glad to hear from you. Hope you are all well.
