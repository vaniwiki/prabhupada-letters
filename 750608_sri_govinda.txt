My dear Sri Govinda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your invitation dated June 5, 1975 and have studied it carefully. One year ago, I already accepted the invitation of Philadelphia temple for their Rathayatra and they are holding it on the same date as you. So, I may not be able to come there for the festival, but I can come there for a few days stay on my way from Los Angeles to Philadelphia, probably about the 8th or 9th of July, and I shall have to leave Chicago on the 11th of July in order to attend the Philadelphia Rathayatra. If this is alright with you, then we can do it like that. If you like, you can set up those appointments and meetings during that time. That will be nice. I will be seeing you all at that time.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
