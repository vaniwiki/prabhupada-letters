My dear Amarendra das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 9, 1973, and I have noted the contents with great care. Whatever you can do to turn the minds of the people towards Krsna Consciousness, that is very much appreciated by me. You are intelligent boy. In consultation with your Godbrothers you can decide how to effectively run the campaign. I want to turn over now the management to my disciples as I am desiring to devote my time now simply for translating the books like Srimad-Bhagavatam. So if you study my books very carefully, then I am sure you will find out the means for applying this Krsna Consciousness philosophy in all spheres of life. There is no limitation. Simply it requires a little common sense practicality. The main point is that Krsna is the center of all activities, whatever is going on. Whatever the activity may be, if Krsna is the center, that is all right. The details simply require a little common sense. So you are there in Dallas, and you have al the details of the situation. So now, with the help of your Godbrothers there, you decide exactly how to execute the thing. After all, the result is given by Krsna. So the main point is simply to execute everything with complete sincerity and enthusiasm, without deviating from the principles that I have given you in my books. So I have seen the news clippings and they are very nice. Now you go on making more and more propaganda for informing people of this philosophy of Krsna Consciousness. If we push this propaganda very strongly and at the same time remain completely pure by following all of the regulative principles very strictly, by chanting sixteen rounds, reading the books, attending mangala aratrika, etc., then everything will be all right.

Hope this finds you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
