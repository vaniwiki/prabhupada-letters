My dear Yashma Sarna,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your letter dated nil. Thank you also for your kind donation of 800 Shillings. The process of Krishna consciousness is very simple. Everything belongs to Krishna, so our only duty is to give everything for Krishna's service, and chant Hare Krishna. So you chant regularly and make advancement.

In February I am going to Calcutta and then Mayapur, so you can see me there.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
