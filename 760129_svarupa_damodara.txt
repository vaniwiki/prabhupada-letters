My dear Svarupa Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated January 21st, 1976 and I have noted the contents carefully.

If you cannot come to India there is no harm. Ordinarily, if you leave, your application will be closed. Better not to take any chances. You instruct your assistants who are coming how and what to discuss with the GBC on your behalf.

In the tentative course outlines some additions are as follows. In the philosophy section there should be a class dealing with all the Vaisnava philosophies (the four sampradayas). Music class can be based on the Sama Veda. In the Political Science class Maharaja Prthu's life may also be studied. There should also be a discussion with the GBC regarding what titles should be awarded to students who pass.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
