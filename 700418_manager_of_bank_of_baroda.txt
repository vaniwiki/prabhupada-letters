Dear Sir:

Re: My savings account No. 29/12802

Kindly refer to your letter No. SB/34/1759, dated 14th March, 1970, which I have replied duly dated on the 25th March, 1970.

I hope by this time you have received sanction for transferring Rs. 5,000 from my above account to the United Bank of India Ltd., 157/B Dharmatalla Street, Calcutta 13, for credit of savings account of Sri M. M. De.

Please therefore transfer the account on receipt of this letter.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
