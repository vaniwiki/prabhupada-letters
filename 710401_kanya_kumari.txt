New Orleans

My dear Kanya Kumari (Carol Bouchier),

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your kind letter dated 2nd February, 1971 as well as your beads. They have been duly chanted on and enclosed herewith. I am glad to accept you as my disciple and have given you the spiritual name Kanya Kumari Devi Dasi. Kanya Kumari means "virgin girl." She is Krishna's energy.

Your husband, Nityananda Das, is now president of our newly formed New Orleans center and as his wife, it is your duty to help him in every way possible. So work cooperatively, husband and wife, and make our New Orleans branch a grand success. And remain unflinching in Krishna's service by strictly following the regulative principles, chanting 16 rounds of beads daily, without fail, and reading all our books. Then Krishna will surely help you.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
