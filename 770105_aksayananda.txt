My dear Aksayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 1/1/77 and have noted the contents.

Now the corner land of the parikrama road may be applied for acquisition. We shall use it for agricultural purposes. Sometime back they approached us for acquiring that land. Now you can seriously do this. First of all check whether it would be possible to build a drainage line to that land. If we can arrange for that it will be very good. It will solve our drainage problem, we won't have to pay tax to the municipality, and it will make that land very cultivatable. That drainage water is very good for fertilization. Please check into this possibility. Do it discreetly, so the acquisition may not be checked if it is possible. If it is not possible then you may go ahead with the sewer line.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
