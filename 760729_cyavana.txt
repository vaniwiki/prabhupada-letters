My dear Cyavana Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 22 July 1976 and have noted the contents with care.

Regarding your desire to return to Africa, I think that it would be best if the matter be decided at the next Mayapur meeting. Therefore kindly wait until then.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
