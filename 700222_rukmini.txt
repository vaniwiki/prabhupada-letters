My dear Rukmini,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your gift of Lugloo Mahaprasadam and the enclosed kind note from you, and I thank you very much for these. I have immediately tasted these lugloos,* and I can understand also how you are happily advancing in the service of Lord Krsna, they are prepared so nicely.

I am so happy to know that you are finding Krsna Consciousness to be the sweetest thing in life, and actually it is so. Please continue your good service attitude more and more and be certain to chant daily the sixteen rounds of beads duly, and Krsna will surely bless you with better and better intelligence for advancing your Krsna Consciousness. Always be sincere and eager to perform your duties allotted by the Lord to you and be successful and joyful in your life.

Thanking you once more, and hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. So far sending these offerings after first offering them to Lord Jagannatha and Sri Sri Radha Krsna, that is alright.\\
