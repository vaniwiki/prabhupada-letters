My dear daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Tulasi I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciples. I have duly chanted your beads, and they have been dispatched by separate post. I have given you the spiritual names as follows:

Jan---Anuradha Devi Dasi

Becky---Bhaktilata Devi Dasi

Tina---Rama Tulasi Devi Dasi\\
Now you please continue to strictly follow the regulative principles and rigidly observe the four principle restrictions, namely: no eating of meat, fish or eggs; no illicit sex life; no gambling; and no intoxication. And always without fail chant at least 16 rounds on your beads daily, and be happy.

If you stick to these principles with determination, you will be freed from all attachment to Maya, by Krishna's grace. The example is that when the sun is in the sky, then where is the question of darkness? Similarly, when Hare Krishna mantra is vibrating on your tongue, and you are hearing attentively, then your consciousness becomes clear, or Krishna consciousness, and there is no question of Maya or hazy consciousness. Just as when the darkness and the light come together, the darkness cannot remain before the light, so Maya cannot stay in the presence of Krishna. Always remember therefore to chant Hare Krishna, and that will save you in all circumstances without any doubt.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
