My dear Tamala Krishna Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated %%_%% from Bhopal and also one forwarded to me from London with enclosures dated April 11, 1973. I am so pleased to learn of the successful preaching; now go on in this way. If possible in Kanpur there is one man ready to receive you. You can open correspondence. In this way you visit all the important cities and you will get thousands and thousands of life members. We can organize in each and every factory of Mr. Birla Sankirtana Movement and in this way can save the country from Communist tendency if a big man like Birla cooperates with us.

In Indore we have got many life members who will help you. The certificate the Governor has given that you are the real sadhu should be published. If possible the Governor may be induced to become life member so that other government men may follow. Tejiyas Das has already made many M.P.s life members.

I am anxious to know about the Mayapur progress. I want that the house must be completely finished before my returning. In London we have purchased land. Mr. Birla wanted to construct temple there. His idea is that the government would not object to sending this marble there so that the carved pieces may be sent and if expert men go there to construct the temple it will be very nice.

Some men from U.S.A. are going to Mayapur for doll making, so teach them nicely and we shall be asking doll exhibit in London. Many tourists come there, and it will a great attention for the tourists.

Now all you senior members work very hard and let me retire for writing books.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
