My dear Dr. Ghosh,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15th December, 1974 and have noted the contents. I thank you for your kind appreciations. Our movement actually has been predicted by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He said that in every town and village all over the world His name would be heard and it is actually happening. Our centers are developing so nicely even in the Muslim countries and countries where Buddhism is the major religion. That proves that this Vaisnava, Sanatana Dharma is not some sectarian philosophy. It proves that what Krsna speaks in the __Bhagavad-gita__ is universal and is applicable to anyone and everyone throughout the world. Therefore they are actually accepting and they are taking to our restrictions. They are chanting Hare Krsna and learning __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ and therefore their lives are becoming happy. I am simply trying to repeat the words of Sri Krsna without any adulteration or twisting and I have full faith that by doing so His message will become well-known throughout the world. Now our books are being so much accepted throughout the universities and colleges as well as amongst the general mass of people. It is really astounding. We are selling literally thousands and thousands of full sized volumes of __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ everyday, in different parts of the world. I am glad that you enjoyed our article in the Bhavan's Journal.

You are cordially invited to come and visit us anytime here in Bombay at your convenience. I am planning to stay in Bombay until mid-Jan. and then I shall go to Australia.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
