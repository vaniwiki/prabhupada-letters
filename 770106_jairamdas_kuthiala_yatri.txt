My dear Jairamdas Kuthiala Yatri,

I am in due receipt of your letter dated 31/12/1976.

Yes, you can come to see me at Prayag. We are having our own camp there. It is proposed that my camp will be near the governor's camp. I'm going there by the 11th instant.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
