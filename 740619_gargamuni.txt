My dear Gargamuni Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. With further reference to my letter of June 13, 1974 I beg to inform you that a difficulty has arisen in that we have not yet received visa permission from the Australian government. As such, it may be that I will not be able to meet you in Bombay on 23 June as previously informed. In case I do not go to Australia I will go to U.S.A. via London.

So unless I meet you on my return to India by the 25th July, do not go outside of India. I want to discuss on some important subject matter and want to meet you and Karandhara together. That is the idea.

In case we do not get the visas and I cannot go to Bombay on June 23rd, then I will send you a telegram. But if you do not receive a telegram that means I will go to Bombay on the 23rd June, and will see you there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
