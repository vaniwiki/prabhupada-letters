My dear Subala,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter from Kanpur dated July 2, 1972, and I have noted the contents therein. Yes, singhania will not help us very much, but if he wants to sponsor a ten-day "__Hare Krishna Festival__"* in Kanpur from Sept. 22 to Oct. 1, 1972, that will be nice. If I am in India at that time, I shall be pleased to attend. In future, you may join either Tamala Krishna's party or Gargamuni's party for preaching tour, this alone preaching is not good.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*or "Bhagavat Dasaha" which means ten days of transcendental discourses on the science of Bhagavan reading from Bhagavad-gita as it is as well as that from Srimad-Bhagavatam. If I attend, I shall let you know timely so that you could give publicity sufficiently. Most probably I shall attend.\\
