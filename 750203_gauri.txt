My dear Gauri dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 23, 1975 and have noted the contents. You are a very expert book distributer, so I do not want you to give it up altogether. If you like, you can also do some painting, but you should still distribute books two days out of the week (at least).

Always strictly follow all the rules and regulations, rising early, attending mangala arati and classes and without fail chanting 16 rounds daily. This will make you strong in Krishna Consciousness which is the most essential thing. Always be engaged 24 hours a day in the service of Krishna and be happy.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
