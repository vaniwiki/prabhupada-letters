====== Letter to: Pradyumna ======

My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of June 25, 1969, and I beg to confirm herewith my approval of your going ahead for arranging for the Bodoni Book type face as I have already instructed you. Please inform me when the negotiations are completed.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
