My dear Upendra dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 15, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Concerning the domes for the temple, you can inquire from Aksayananda Swami in Vrindaban who did the domes on the Krishna-Balarama Temple. To date I have not received any letter from Vasudeva in reply to my last letter. If perhaps there was some delay, you can send the letter to Paris as I am leaving for London tomorrow and shortly thereafter to Paris.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
