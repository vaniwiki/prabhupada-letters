My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I hope by this time you have received my letter dated 6th May, 1970, along with papers, tapes, etc.

I have received one letter from Balmukund Parikh, the copy of which is enclosed herewith. It is understood that he is introducing something new in the name of teaching Devanagari script. The prayer of the Spiritual Master as he has quoted has no use for us, it is completely impersonal. This prayer immediately must be stopped.

Another thing is he asked me about Aurobindo's estimation. This means that he gradually wants to introduce Aurobindo philosophy. All these things do not sound very nice.

Please let me know what is the necessity of learning Devanagari script. We are transliterating all our books---Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita, Brahma Samhita, etc.---in Roman type, So why you should waste your time in learning Devanagari script?

So I am very much anxious to know what is the actual situation because I can scent that Mr. Parikh wants to introduce something in my absence which is completely against Krsna Consciousness. I hope you will understand me right and reply this letter by return mail what is the actual situation.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
