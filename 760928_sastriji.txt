Dear Sastriji,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your kind letter dated 26 inst. I am so enthused by understanding your desire. Yes, we require qualified men like you for spreading the Krishna Consciousness Movement all over the world. I shall request you to come here immediately with this letter of identification and see me without delay. We have got good accommodation for you. I am here up to 8th October. The best thing will be that you come and see me on receipt of this letter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
