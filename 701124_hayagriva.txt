New Vrindaban

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 16th November, 1970 and I've noted the contents carefully. I have instructed the GBC members with me here in India that they should write you once a week and report on activities here. It is very encouraging to hear that Pittsburgh temple is doing so nicely and that New Vrindaban is also being developed gradually. As far as the roadside property is concerned it is in long standing for purchase. So try to purchase as soon a possible, as you are hoping to get finances from spiritual sky incense which you are manufacturing under Ranadhir's expert guidance in Pittsburgh.

Regarding KRSNA book, Vol II, 4,000 copies may be sent to the U.S.A. and 1,000 may be sent to London; the remaining 5,000 can be sent to Bombay, India.

Regarding Printing of Bhagavad-gita complete and unabridged edition, it may be printed with our ISKCON PRESS and 5,000 copies may be sent, printed and folded to Bombay because I notice in your ISKCON PRESS newsletter that Advaita has expressed his opinion that if sent by ship without folding first, it would not be possible for the books to be properly folded and printed here in India. Regarding the missing verses, I will see if it is required and will send you at a later date.

Kirtanananda Maharaja is feeling double separation. If he likes, he can go back to New Vrindaban. Let him feel only one separation. As far as myself, most probably I shall go back to U.S.A. by next spring, so I also am feeling separation.

In your letter you refer to Gurudasa as GBC member, but I think there is some misunderstanding because he has not yet been appointed by me as GBC member, because there is no vacancy.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Syama Dasi and son Samba. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have advised K. Maharaja to return to New Vrindaban. ACB\\
