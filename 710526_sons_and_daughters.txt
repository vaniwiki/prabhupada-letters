My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your kind letter dated 17th May, 1971 and I am appreciating it very much. So far as your joint application for my returning to U.S.A., you will be glad to know that by the middle of June I shall be returning and I am surely going to see you all then. Presently I am in Calcutta where we just held a very successful "Hare Krishna Festival" and we were drawing 35,000 people daily for hearing discourses on Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita, for seeing Aratik and taking prasadam also. I will be staying here until the 31st instant and then will go to London via Bombay. From there I shall return to U.S.A.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
