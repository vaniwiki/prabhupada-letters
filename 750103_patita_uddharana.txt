====== Letter to: Patita Uddharana ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Patita Uddharana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 27th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Madhavananda is now being sent to Hong Kong to collect for Krishna-Balarama Mandir in Vrndavana.

So, all your desires are fulfilled. Now, work more enthusiastically in Krishna's service and do not deviate from my teachings and everything will be a success.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
