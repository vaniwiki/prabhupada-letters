My dear Pusta Krsna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 30, 1976 and have noted the contents.

If you relieve me of the burden of management, that will be a very great service to Krsna and the movement. See that everything is going on nicely. With great endeavor we have made the framework, now we have to see that things are going on nicely.

Yes, this preaching work is our mission. It is Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mission, my Guru Maharaja's mission, and my mission. It is through the parampara. As I am trying to discharge my Guru Maharaja's mission, you also try and things will go on nicely.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever-well wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
