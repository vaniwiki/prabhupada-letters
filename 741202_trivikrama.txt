My dear Trivikrama Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I have seen your letter addressed to Brahmananda Swami dated November 29, 1974 and have noted the contents with care. I have sent you one cable on November 21 reading as follows: PLEASE STAY AT LEAST ONE MONTH DO NOT LEAVE IT SHOULD NOT BE CLOSED I AM GOING TO SEE THE SITUATION STOP BHURIJANA MAY ALSO BE PRESENT COPY MADHUDVISA---AC BHAKTIVEDANTA SWAMI\\
So you have not acknowledged that you have received this cable. So you stay there in Hong Kong and struggle for Krishna. I received today also the Chinese literature On the Way to Krsna. One Chinese literature is 1000 times better preaching than worshiping in the temple. But we to have a place and the worship must go on. Without having a sitting place, how will people come to see us and talk with us? So try to distribute and publish as much as possible. I am coming there very soon, so please arrange for it.

If it can be continued why close it? The book you have published is real preaching. At least the Chinese will have some idea of Krishna. So I will come and see how things are going on.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
