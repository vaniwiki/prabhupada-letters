My dear Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 11 Dec. 74 and have noted the contents carefully.

You should send a copy of that document to me immediately of if Hansadutta is coming to Bombay you can send it with him. Please keep me informed of the position with Mr. Mody and also of Mr. Kewal Krishan. I hope things are going on well there. I am depending on you as one of my elder disciples to set a nice example for the others to follow. This is very much wanted. You must become ideal in all respects, following all of our principles; rising early, chanting 16 rounds, attending classes, eating only Krsna prasadam, etc. This simple formula will make everything perfect.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
