My dear Sama dasa,

Please accept my blessings for you, your wife, and your new baby daughter, Sarada devi dasi. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 8, 1975 and I have noted the contents carefully. Thank you very much for the pictures of Baltimore yatra, especially I have appreciated the beauty of the Gaura-Nitai Deities which you are going to install. Where were these Deities made?

I herein accept your proposal for first initiation as of Francis (Tulasiballabha das) and Carol (Ujjvalaprada dasi). Now, I am accepting them on your recommendation so you must convince them of the seriousness of following the four regulative principles and chanting a minimum of 16 rounds japa daily. Hold a fire-yajna and do the needful in this connection.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
