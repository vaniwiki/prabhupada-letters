Paris

My dear Madhavananda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 25, 1975 and I am glad to know that everything is going on well in the Paris temple. Upon your recommendation I am accepting the following as my initiated disciples:

Olivier Anconne---Bhusana dasa

Frank---Visodhana dasa

Frances Marlier---Anisa devi dasi

Also upon your recommendation, I am accepting the following as twice-born initiated brahmanas:

Indriyadamana dasa Brahmacari

Mahabala dasa Brahmacari

Brajisma dasa Brahmacari

Vrsaktri dasa Brahmacari

Avyaya dasa Adhikari

Jyestha devi dasi

Navalanga devi dasi

Their sanctified threads and mantra sheets are enclosed. Please hold the fire sacrifice and impress upon them that they are taking vows before Radha Krsna, the Spiritual Master, and the assembled Vaisnavas. Please see that they are chanting 16 rounds and following the four regulative principles. This is your responsibiity.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
