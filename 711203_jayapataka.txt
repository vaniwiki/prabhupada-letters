My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I am sending Biharilal Prabhu to Calcutta for the purpose of collecting four first-class koles, ten karatalas and a few thousand magazines for taking with him for our Madras program. We distributed 12,000 magazines here in Delhi, so I think 12,000 magazines should be sent to Madras. For payment for the other things Tamala Krishna will pay. You may please assist our Madras party by arranging these items for Biharilal to bring.

I am also sending Mani Bandha Prabhu to Calcutta to relieve you of export business. I think now we may only export drums, karatalas, japa malas and arati articles. You may now devote your full time to preaching work and making members.

Karandhara has sent me one telegram inquiring about __Krishna Book.__ Whether you have sent the shipping document to him?

You will be pleased to know that we are trying here in Delhi for permits for our large India party to be in Mayapur for Lord Caitanya's Appearance Day. I think it may not be necessary to have a second pandal program in Calcutta in January. What do you think?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
