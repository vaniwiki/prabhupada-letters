My dear son,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Balavanta I have gladly consented to accept you as my duly initiated disciple. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent under separate post. Your spiritual name is Radha Mohan das Brahmacary. I am so glad to learn that you have been such a great help to Balavanta there in our Atlanta center. I can understand that you are a very sincere boy and that you are a very eligible candidate for going back to home, back to Godhead. And the process is simple. Follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read our literatures, go for street sankirtan, etc. In this way keep yourself engaged in Krishna’s business 24 hours and you will be really happy in this life and in the end you will reach the Supreme destination.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
