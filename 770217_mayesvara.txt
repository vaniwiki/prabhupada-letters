Dear Mayesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of February 7, and heard the contents. Regarding whether to follow Tamal Krsna Goswami and work at architecture and mechanical plans in the Pennsylvania farm or to come and work in the same way with Saurabha in India, now Tamal Krsna himself is in India. So you can also come to India and work with both of them.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
