Sri I, Kulabhandra Singh\\
Secretary, Manipur Gita Mandal\\
Imphal

Dear Sir,

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 8, 1976. I am looking forward to visiting Manipur in April. The list of Foreign and Indian devotees who will accompany me which Mr. L. Kulabidhu Singh has is quite alright.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
