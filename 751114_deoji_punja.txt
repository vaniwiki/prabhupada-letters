My dear Deoji Punja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 1, 1975 with enclosures. I have informed Upendra das, who is in Vrndavana, that his ticket is waiting for him in Delhi. So it is good that you have arranged it. And I think that he will be a good asset for your activities there in Fiji.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
