My dear Dr. Channa Reddy,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge with thanks your letter dated April 22nd, 1975. I am very much obliged to you for your kind appreciation of my humble attempt in opening the Vrindavan temple of Krishna-Balaram. It was only successful on account of your presence and I thank you once again for your presence there. After this Vrindavan affair, I went to Kurukshetra to attend the meeting of Manava Dharma organized by Sri G.L. Nanda. So, after attending the meeting I had to come back again to Bombay for starting to Australia where I have got several meetings arranged. I am staying at the above address. I am also enclosing herewith one copy of the letter addressed to Mr. G.L. Nanda. And my ambition is that the Kurukshetra field should be fully utilized for spreading the cult of Krishna Consciousness all over the world. The enclosed letter to Mr. Nanda will speak for itself and it will be a great pleasure for me if you will also co-operate in this attempt.

So far our Bombay temple is concerned, I have not received any reply of the Governor to you. If you have received any reply by this time, kindly let me know what is his decision.

Thanking you once more for your kind co-operation in my spiritual activities.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
