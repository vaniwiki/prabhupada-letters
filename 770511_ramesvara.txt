My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 1st, 1977 along with all of the photographs and drawings.

I have just sent you a telegram readings as follows:

"ALL PAINTINGS OKAY BABY KRISHNA LYING DOWN"

All of the artists' drawings are alright as they are showing, except for this one correction, that baby Krsna should be showing lying down, not standing up in front of Visnu.

I am very glad to know that you are all working so hard to double the book distribution this year. Here in Risikesh Mahesh Yogi has his headquarters and he is training his disciples. But he has to pay each of them a regular monthly salary and give them vacations as well. So he is not so fortunate as I am, that I have so many sincere disciples that I do not have to pay them any salary nor do they ever ask for any vacation. Instead they are working twice as hard to double the book distribution. I am so much thankful to all of my sincere disciples who are working so hard to fulfill this great mission of Krsna consciousness.

Jayananda's death is glorious. It is very good that he had stated, what is the use of such a useless body, better to give it up. He has left his body very wonderfully, and he has been transferred to Vaikuntha. I have already sent a condolence letter for publication in Back To Godhead. Everyone should follow the example of Jayananda. I am very proud that I had such a nice disciple. If possible Jayananda's picture should be hung in the ratha of Lord Jagannatha, and in all of our temples a day may be set aside for holding a festival in his honor, just as we do on the disappearance day of the other great Vaisnavas.

All of the photos of the doll exhibit are very nice. As you have suggested I have written a letter to Ambarisa encouraging him about the doll exhibit for Washington D.C.

From the photographs of the new construction I can see that in L.A. things are improving. Lord Dvarakadhisa is sitting there overseeing everything. He will give you all facility, simply you must cooperatively work together, faithfully following in the footsteps of the acaryas. You have written that the rent will pay back the loan and mortgages on the new building, but who will pay the rent if there are all brahmacaris living there?

I am staying here in Risikesh in the best house. It is situated just on the Ganges and the climate is very first-class. Many persons are coming in the afternoon for darsana, and in every case they are going away very much impressed that our movement is not some concoction.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
