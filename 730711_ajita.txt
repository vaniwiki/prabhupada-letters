Dear Ajita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28 June, 1973, and I have carefully noted the contents.

It is encouraging to me that you are in Stockholm trying to open a center, six of you including your wife. From your letter it appears you have found a nice place for a center there. Yes, we can use everything in Krsna's service and when Krsna gives us a nice big house that does not mean we use it for our eating and sleeping, but we work harder in His service.

It is also very favorable that you are able to do sankirtana in the streets and getting a nice reception. The book you enclosed is excellently done. Let me know how you are doing in distributing them.

Regarding the initiated disciple of my Godbrother Sanananda Swami, Vamanadeva das, please approach him and request that he come and see me in London.

So Everything appears to be going well there, just go on increasing. As you write that the Swedish society has placed great stress on material happiness so you can expose how this material life is actually full of miseries and temporary, and the so-called happiness is only illusion. People in the western countries are becoming gradually fed up with materialistic propaganda so you will find good response simply by chanting, speaking from Bhagavad gita as it is, and distributing prasadam to everyone. Unless the human society takes to this process the situation is very precarious. So we have to work hard.

Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
