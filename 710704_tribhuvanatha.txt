London

My dear Tribhuvanatha,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to all the boys and girls there who have worked so hard to make Rathayatra festival in London, scheduled for today, a grand success. Please let me know how things have worked out, and how many people attended the function.

Presently I am still in L.A. and by the middle of this month I should be going to N.Y. From there, you will be glad to know, I will be going directly to London. Here in L.A. things are going on very nicely and just this week 40 new devotees were initiated. So the stock of japa beads I brought with me has been depleted. Malati Prabhu was supposed to have brought some beads with her from India, and so I would like that those beads be sent immediately to N.Y. center by air. I have instructed Tamala Krishna in Calcutta and he soon will be sending more beads to London, for distribution in Europe. So take care of this matter right away so that the beads will be there upon my arrival in N.Y.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
