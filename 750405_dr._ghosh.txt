My dear Dr. Ghosh,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your two letters dated March 20th and March 23rd, 1975 and have noted the contents very carefully. I thank you very much for your kind invitation and, tentatively, I accept it. Most probably, we shall go to Allahabad from Vrndavana by the 28th of April, 1975 and stay there for a week, and then start for Bombay on the way to Australia by the 5th of May I wish to hold classes on Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam for one hour in the evening and one hour in the morning. I do not know if gentlemen there will spare so much time. If not two hours, then I shall hold one hour Bhagavad-gita class, and I wish to see how people there appreciate our missionary activities. It is strictly on the basis of Lord Krishna's teachings as they are presented by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. That is our mission. So, if people become interested in our philosophy, then we shall consider the other two items, namely, the nursery school and dispensary. So far dispensary is concerned, we have none all over the world. It will be a new attempt. So far the school is concerned, we have got in Africa and America, and we have got men experienced to teach on our line. But for dispensary, we have no experience at all.

I do not know how you are at the present moment about your health but I request you again to come to Vrndavana about the 20th of April. Then we shall discuss elaborately and make a decision. Otherwise, if you do not come, we will go as already decided and open a nice center there if possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
