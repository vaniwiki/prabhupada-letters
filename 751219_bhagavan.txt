My dear Bhagavan Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I have received the list of first and second initiations and I have accepted them as my duly initiated disciples. Enclosed please find the sacred threads duly chanted upon by me. Now hold a fire ceremony, and instruct the new devotees to chant 16 rounds daily and follow the regulative principles of devotional service.

The newly initiated brahmanas should hear the mantra from the tape recording through the right ear. Brahmin initiation means to be very clean, inside and outside. Inside by chanting the glories of the Lord, and outside by bathing regularly. Washing hands and mouth after eating. Instruct them all these things, and do it yourself, example is better than precept.\\
