My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 7, 1973 and have noted the contents.

I am glad to hear that some progress is being made for getting that house in Malaysia. Please keep me posted as things progress in this regard.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. That Lalitananda Vana, who was formerly Hrsikesa Brahmacary my disciple, wants to join us again. Can you give me some information about him as you met him several times in Bombay.
