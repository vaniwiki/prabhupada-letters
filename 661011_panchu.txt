My dear Panchu,

Since I have come to America I have not heard anything from you. In the beginning I had to write two or three letter to your revered father, but I did not receive any reply from him. I therefore did not write him again and still I am anxious to hear about you all. Please therefore let me know how are you all. How is your mother and Bahuma, your wife, and how is your father. I hope everything is alright with you by Grace of Sri Sri Radha Damodara Jeu. Please reply this letter per return post as well as please let me know if you are receiving Rs 5/- per month regularly from the Punjab National Bank Ltd at Vrndavana. I am anxious to know about it.

At Gopinatha Bazar almost in front of Mahaprabhu's Temple, there is a Bengali gentleman's shop for selling Pan and pictures. I want one dozen each of Sri Radha Krsna and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu dancing with His associate pictures. Please ask him what is the price. Whether he can send these pictures by post to my above American address. On hearing from you I shall send you the money either to the above shop keeper or to you as you write to me. How is Sarojini and other devotees of the temple.

Besides this, you may ask your father whether he is still interested in the matter of starting the Rupanuga Para Vidya Pitha in the land he proposed to give me on lease terms. Perhaps you remember this proposal. When I first came to your temple you measured the land yourself. Now if your father is agreeable to the proposal, the construction of the buildings can now be taken up and my American disciples are ready to spend for the proposed building of Sri Rupanuga Para Vidya Pitha. If your father decides to give me any other land within the compound of Sri Sri Radha Damodara Ji Temple for the above building that also can be accepted. If so please open correspondence in this connection and I shall place the matter to my American disciples for consideration . They are eager to do something at Vrndavana according to my direction. Now here is the opportunity to reconstruct the temple compound of Sri Sri Radha Damodara Jeu. So I shall be very glad to hear from you or your father in reply to this letter and I am thanking you in anticipation.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
