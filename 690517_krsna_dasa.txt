My dear Krishna das,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much encouraged to receive your letter of May 12, 1969, along with the German articles published in two different papers with pictures. It is very, very encouraging that you are holding kirtanas in public places and some way or other people are becoming interested. These outdoor kirtanas should be rigidly followed at least one hour daily. That will make our movement popular there. We have good experience here in every city, especially Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and here in Columbus. This is making our movement very popular more and more, so in any circumstances, you all go together outdoors for kirtana at least for one hour daily.

I am very pleased also to note that the __Peace Formula__ will be printed very soon, and I am expecting it to come at any moment. I will be going to New Vrindaban in about a week, so you may send it there. The address is as follows: New Vrindaban, RD 3, Moundsville, West Virginia. You have written to say that the climate in Germany is very nice in July and August, so when Mandali Bhadra and Vrndavanesvari arrive there, you call me and I shall go there whether I am in London or the USA. So far as getting engagements, don't expect any help from Sadananda because I understand he is practically ruined by his health. So don't trouble him, and let him take full rest.

Please convey my blessings to Sivananda and Jaya Govinda. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. My dear Jaya Govinda will you let me know the list of goods that you have sent to Calcutta for dispatch by the United Shipping Corporation. ACB
