My dear Svarupa Damodara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 11, 1975. I had never received your letter of September 21st and the invitation for going to Imphal for Manipur Gita Mandal. So I have now written them a letter as per enclosed and please find enclosed the copies. So we shall go there in April, 1976 and I will take some of my disciples who are good kirtana men. So you also should come and join in this program. Please arrange for that.

Regarding your letter of September 21, yes, it is a very good idea to have a meeting at the Mayapur meeting time to thoroughly discuss the Bhaktivedanta Institute. So please do the needful. It will be a great service if you can organize such an Institute in the U.S.A. In Dallas there is one former army base which is now vacant that has a number of buildings and enough land. It is located about 70 miles from the city of Dallas. So you should immediately correspond with Jagadisa. It is very big and nice. I think we should take it for the Bhaktivedanta Institute. The climate there is also nice.

I am glad that you are doing lectures in the various universities. When you go, take all of our books and keep them in your front. We have got so many books for study.

I am forwarding you the letter which Dr. Wolf has written me. I have not replied it, but you can reply it as you think fit.

Also enclosed is one article sent to me by Hayagriva about the new discovery which creates turmoil and confuses the physicists. The material scientists, they are discovering so many particles, but they have not yet discovered the soul. In __Bhagavad-gita__ we learn:

> apareyam itas tv anyam
> prakrtim viddhi me param
> jiva-bhutam maha-baho
> yayedam dharyate jagat
> [[books:bg:7:5|(Bg. 7.5)]]

That the jiva-atma is the superior particle and these other particles are all inferior. So this is their business, to discover the inferior particles and neither have they discovered the superior particle which is one ten-thousandth the tip of a hair. Simply they are wasting their time. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
