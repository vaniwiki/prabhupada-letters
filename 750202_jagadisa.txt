====== Letter to: Jagadisa ======

Dallas

My dear Jagadisa das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 22, 1975 and have noted the contents. All of your proposals have been approved by me. Try to increase the book distribution as much as possible. This is our business---to put our books in the hands of intelligent men of America. If they read even one page, the influence will be so great.

I have accepted Doug, Judith and Paul for 1st initiation and their names are respectively; Dayala Nitai, dasa, Jaganmayi devi dasi, and Paripurna dasa. Their beads can be chanted on by Kirtanananda Svami. Train them nicely to follow all of our rules and regulations strictly without fail and to engage 24 hours in Krishna's service. Help them to understand the importance of this Krishna Consciousness Movement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
