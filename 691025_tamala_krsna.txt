My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated October 17, 1969 and October 22, 1969. The letters were very long; I have read them once and shall read them again carefully. Here things are improving. We have got now practically two centers in London: one in Mr. Lennon's place and one in 7 Bury Place. We are negotiating for a big church in Oxford and there is possibility of this coming out successful too. Besides that, I am negotiating with some local, influential Indian gentleman for the world Sankirtana Party. They have also given some hopes, and the preaching work here is also going on nicely. Yesterday we had a meeting in a law college and all the boys and girls joined us in chanting and dancing. But I think Mukunda is little bit strained managing all the affairs. The most important thing before us immediately is to organize a nice Sankirtana Party here in London for daily work, because there is as good potency of preaching work in London as there is in Los Angeles. But I do not know if it will be possible for you to come here for some days. Mukunda likes your assistance for coordinating all these opportunities. So please consider these points, and if you think that your absence in the West Coast will not cause any mismanagement, then I would advise you for some days to come here. So I shall be glad to hear from you in this connection by return mail.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
