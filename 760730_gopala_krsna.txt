My dear Gopala Krsna das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 23, 1976 and have noted the contents. Yes I will go to the Delhi temple when I come. You make all arrangements so that everything shall be nice there. I will also go to Madras if you arrange.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
