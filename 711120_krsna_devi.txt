My dear Krishna devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of November 7, 1971, and I am encouraged to note that you are working very nicely in Krishna Consciousness, despite being there in a foreign land with so many obstacles. This kind of service is especially appreciated by Krishna, that some devotees should take risk for His preaching work. And my Guru Maharaja repeatedly requested his disciples to go out into far-off lands for spreading the message of Lord Caitanya. Thank you very much for this.

Regarding your cookbook, I have turned it over to Malati and Yamuna Prabhus who are with me in Delhi, along with their husbands, to go over the contents carefully and then I will finish the final editing and send it to you very soon. I will write a brief introduction as you desire.

Sankirtana means preaching. So if you are regularly holding classes, street Sankirtana may be postponed until the proper time. Meanwhile it is very encouraging that Dinesh Prabhu may be starting to teach classes in Vedic literature at Tel Aviv University. Just try to give this Krishna philosophy to the intelligent class of men, and distribute our books as many as possible, and your all efforts will come out successful. Know it for certain that by this your sincere working for Krishna, very soon you will go back to Home, back to Godhead.

I have notified the GBC that they should supply you with more men as they are required by you, so when that time comes you may apply to Syamasundara, who is travelling with me, or to Karandhara or Rupanuga in the US and they will do the needful.

I hope this meets you, your good husband, Dinesh, and your daughter Visnu Arati dasi in good health and cheerful mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
