My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your latest letter, undated, along with two advance copies of Back to Godhead #46 and #47. I have handed over these copies to Mr. George Harrison who is enjoying them very much. Yesterday he has taken me to one 75-acre farm near London which he has found for our London asrama. If we take this place then I shall make London my world or European headquarters, and I am applying also for British residential status. I have cancelled the program temporarily in Nairobi for completing my business in London, so I shall remain here until the end of August, and then fly to New Vrindaban as scheduled.

I am very happy to understand from you that the printing work is going on prolifically, that is our first business, to print and distribute this Krsna knowledge very widely. I am expecting very soon the delivery of Bhagavad-gita As it Is* and you may dispatch many copies to England also. I am very happy to hear of your daily walk through that Brooklyn neighborhood with the deities. That is customary in India, and all of the neighbors come out and offer incense, garlands and other gifts for Radha and Krsna, so you may encourage your neighbors there to also make offerings and chant with us, and their lives will be very much improved.

Hoping this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Bali M. = r.e. your letter to me of 28th instant, I can't say what Prabhupada's schedule will be for NY, it looks like we'll be going to L.A. in a few days due to poor health. Will let you know -Jaya!

Enclosed find one article for BTG written by Acyutananda Swami = recommended for publishing by Prabhupada - S.D.A.
