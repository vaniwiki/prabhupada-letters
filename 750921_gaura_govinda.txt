Hyderabad

My dear Gaura Govinda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your long letter dated September 12, 1975 and your letter dated September 17th and have noted the contents. Regarding your returning to your own village, a sannyasa is not supposed to go back to his own village. If you are doing some substantial work, you should not agitate your mind for opening a center in Orissa. I talked here with Anandapanda and he said after October the season in Orissa is better. I have proposed to him also for arranging for us to go there and during that season we may go there in a party and preach there and if possible open a center.

I understand that you are doing well in Hyderabad so there is no necessity for immediate change. I am going now on tour of Africa and when I return I shall see you and we shall do the needful. I may go to Hyderabad when I return.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
