London

My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. Since you have left for London because of your wife's illness, I have not heard anything from you. How is your wife doing? What has been your program also? Please let me know.

You will be glad to know that I will be in London to participate there in Rathayatra festival. On the 20th instant I am going to Moscow for five days and then on to Paris to visit their new temple. From there I will go directly to London, by the end of the month. So while you are there, please see to it that Rathayatra festival is nicely performed and sure to be a grand success.

Please offer my blessings to your wife. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
