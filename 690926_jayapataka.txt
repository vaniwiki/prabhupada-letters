My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 11th, and I have noted the contents. Enclosed please find one photograph of the Radha-Krishna throne, so you may begin constructing it as soon as possible. When the Radha-Krishna Deities are installed, you may turn your main attention to Them, rather than to the Lord Jagannatha Deities. You continue to keep Jagannatha nicely though, and sometimes change His dress. So far as your having already ordered instruments from India, that is all right. Regarding your question about the verse in the prayers to the Spiritual Master, the Spiritual Master is one of the associates of Krishna. The prayers offered by Visvanatha Cakravarti to his Spiritual Master have a special significance. His Spiritual Master was one of the assistant __gopis,__ so the prayer was offered like that. On the whole, the Spiritual Master is an agent of Krishna. But either He is assistant to the __gopis__ or assistant to the cowherds boys, He is on the level of Krishna. That is the verdict of all scriptures. Krishna is worshipable God and the Spiritual Master is worshipper God. The exact words are __sebya__ (worshipable) and __sebak__ (worshipper).

Your explanation of __Annamoya__ is all right. __Pranamoya__ means there are different types of airs, and the spirit soul is floating on the air, just like all the planets are floating in the air. This __Pranamoya__ air is transferred by breathing exercises, but we have nothing to do with such exercises. Our __prana,__ or life, is surrendered to Krishna. That is the first class yoga system approved by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita. This __Pranamoya, Annamoya,__ etc. are different stages for persons who are too much engrossed in the bodily concept of life. Our philosophy begins from the point where we immediately accept that I am not this body; I am pure spirit soul, servant of God, Krishna. Therefore, these studies are meant for neophyte transcendentalists. But this devotional service is far above such platform. Regarding your last question, generally those who are attracted very much to Lord Caitanya and Goswamis are understood to develop to the conjugal love stage with Lord Krishna. So I am very much pleased, and I congratulate you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have just now received your letter of September 23rd along with the check. Thank you.
