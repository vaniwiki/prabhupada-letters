Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 12, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

Gurukrpa Maharaja is arranging to send you monthly $10,000 which can be used to continue the construction in Mayapur. This money is being sent to the American Express Bank, Old Courthouse Road, Calcutta, India, in account name of International Society for Krishna consciousness, a/c #090031. It is a good policy to use the local builders as you mentioned. Go on building and the money will be supplied for now to the extent of $10,000, monthly which is over Rs. 90,000.

Enclosed please find clippings of our New York Rathayatra which was held last Sunday. You can show these to your friend Mr. Choudhary and others. I always remember Mr. Choudhary and his good wife.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
