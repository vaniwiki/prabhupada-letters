====== Letter to: Svarupa Damodara ======

Atlanta

My dear Svarupa Damodara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 2, 1976.

Regarding your initial points you may refer to my previous letter dated 29th January, 1976.

As far as the College and University Lecture Party is concerned that is very important and it may be done very seriously. As a matter of fact Tamala Krishna Maharaja is here and he suggests that our educated gentlemen travel with his buses. So what is the use of working alone. Working conjointly is better. Therefore I have instructed him to call you when he returns to the United States. He has assured me that his college programs are very organized and he is very enthusiastic to increase.

Regarding publishing books, these books can be published by you and men in your rank. Ordinary man cannot write such books. So therefore if a book is written by one man with "Bhaktivedanta" or "Bhakti-sarvabhauma" and it is of high quality then it may be considered by me for publishing.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
