My dear Hit Sharanji,

Please accept my blessings.

In case this letter has not safely arrived there, I am sending herewith a copy. Also, please find enclosed two invitation cards for the opening of our London temple: one is for you and one is for Sri. J. Dalmia. Please hand it over to him conveniently. I shall be hoping to hear from you soon.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
