====== Letter to: Sri Tikandas J. Batra ======

Sri Tikandas J. Batra\\
Bombay

Dear Sri Batraji,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to thank you for your nice letter dated January 20th, 1976.

Those who take Indian philosophy and scripture as mythological are not at all intelligent. They have been described in the Bhagavad-gita as "sinful", "rascals", "lowest of mankind", "bereft of all knowledge", and "atheistic". __Na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah/ mayayapahrta-jnana asuram bhavam asritah__ [[books:bg:7:15|(Bg. 7.15)]]. This psychological conception of the so-called Indian philosophers has killed Indian civilization. There is no question of mythology when Krishna says: __dehino 'smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara/ tatha dehantara praptir dhiras tatra na muhyati__ [[books:bg:2:13|(Bg. 2.13)]]. A baby grows to become a child, and a child grows to become a boy, and a boy grows to a young man, and a young man develops to middle age, and grows to an old man, and then what is next for the old man. The so-called mythologists don't know what will happen to the old man. Neither they believe in the next life, and even if they do believe they don't know what will happen to the old man or what kind of life he will get next. Therefore they are all fools and rascals.

How a rascal can become a professor? That is the defect of modern day education. It is said in the Srimad-Bhagavatam: Na te vidhuh svartha gatim hi visnu. Philosophy means to find out the actual source of everything. Our Vedanta philosophy begins __athāto brahma jijñāsā,__ to enquire about Brahma, that is real philosophy. And the Supreme Brahma is described as the original source of everything: __Janmady asya yato__ [[books:sb:1:1:1|(SB 1.1.1)]], etc. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the real philosophy because it describes the original source of everything---__Janmady asya yatah.__ The first chapter of Srimad-Bhagavatam begins with this verse. Accept this, all other philosophies are simply jugglery of words to mislead the less intelligent class of men. You are benedicted by Lord Krishna that you are doubting the philosophical speculation of the mudhas. Please try to read real philosophy---Vedanta Sutra and its right commentary by Vyasadeva, Srimad-Bhagavatam. And the preliminary study, Bhagavad-gita. If you

directly in the Bhagavad-gita.

My request is that you read carefully the Bhagavad-gita As It Is and do not be mislead by the fools and rascals. The fools and rascals have spoiled Bhagavad-gita simply by their interpretation. We have published it As It Is. Try to visit our center at Juhu---Hare Krishna Land---and associate with the devotees. They will be able to answer all your philosophical questions.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
