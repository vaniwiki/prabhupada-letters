My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 22 June 1973.

We had previously received copies of the Swahili language publication of __Topmost Yoga System__ from Brahmananda Swami and it is very nicely done. This printing and distribution of our literature is most important aspect of our propaganda work.

Yes, send me 2,000 of the stampless aerogrammes on my own letterhead.

I have already mailed my acceptance for your initiation into sannyasa order to Brahmananda Swami, along with sannyasa robes etc., and you should shortly receive same.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
