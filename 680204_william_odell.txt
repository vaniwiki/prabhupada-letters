====== Letter to: William Odell ======

My dear William Odell,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter, and for your inquisitiveness. You are Krishna's part and parcel. As you love your hands and legs, as you feel when your hand is in trouble, similarly Krishna feels for you when you are in trouble. The hand has value when it is attached to the body. Similarly, we have values when we are Krishna Conscious. The hand has no value detached from the whole body. Krishna is the Whole and we are His parts and parcel. Try to understand this philosophy of simultaneously one and different.

The hand and body is created all at a time. It is not that the body is created first and then the hand is created. Our relation with Krishna is like the hand and the body. Therefore, Krishna and we both are eternal, and there is no history of eternity. It has no beginning and no end. Krishna is blue because He is all attractive. The sky is blue because it reflects Krishna's blue color in the spiritual sky as much as the sunlight is reflected through skylight glasses.

I hope your questions are fully answered; if at any time you have got some questions, please write and send them to me. Thanking you once more for your nice letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
