My dear Labangalatika,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 4 and I have noted the contents. Upon inquiring from Hayagriva prabhu regarding the deity worship program at New Vrindaban, I have been assured that everything is going on nicely now, and that Radha and Krishna are receiving proper care and service. It is very good that you are feeling so much responsibility for the welfare of Their Lordships, and I hope that you will very enthusiastically engage yourself in tending to Their needs. Always remember that cleanliness and promptness are two very important requirements in Deity worship.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and a happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
