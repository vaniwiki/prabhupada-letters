====== Letter to: Govinda ======

My dear Govinda dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 25, 1973, and have noted the contents with great satisfaction.

The report of book distribution going on in Chicago is very pleasing to me. As you know, our Chicago center is one of the most important. Please continue to use your intelligence to find out how to distribute my books more and more. I am especially pleased to learn that you are introducing my books as textbooks in the colleges. We especially have to try to attract the educated young men and women in your country so that in future there will be many strong leaders to keep our Krsna Consciousness Movement strong.

I am also very pleased to learn that you have come out successful in stopping the police from arresting our men and stopping our sankirtana activities. Your sankirtana program, the report of the Lord Caitanya festival and the very nice newspaper article that you have sent are all indications of your sincerity in trying to put full effort to push on Lord Caitanya's sankirtana movement.

Upon your recommendation I am gladly accepting Peter Laudert as my initiated disciple and as you have requested am sending him a letter (enclosed). Please have Kirtanananda Maharaja chant on beads for sanctification and you may hold a fire yajna.

Regarding my coming to install large marble Radha and Krsna, yes I will be very pleased to come.

Hoping this finds you and your wife and son in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
