My dear Hansadutta das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 7, 1976.

Yes, with great pleasure I will accompany and we shall go village to village.

I have seen the pictures and the buses look very nice. They appear costly.

Regarding London, what I can advise. We must have a city centre. You do the needful, whatever is practical.*

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*At least keep 7 Bury Place London, as our London office\\
