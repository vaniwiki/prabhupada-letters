====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

Kelso, Washington

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated November 13 and December 11, 1972, and always I am very glad to hear from your good self. You are one of my first and nicest disciples that is a fact, and I am always hoping that you will again come to live with me again, along with your good wife Janaki. That will be nice. But even I am far away, as you say you are remembering me, so also I am remembering you, and in that sense we are never separated. So I can understand that you are rigidly following the regulative principles, chanting without fail always 16 rounds, so in this way you will be protected and your enthusiasm for pushing on this Krishna Consciousness Movement will not dwindle.

I like very much your proposal for approaching all the big leaders of the world and presenting them one Bhagavad-Gita As It Is and one copy of BTG, along with letter of description of our Krishna Consciousness Movement. If you can send me the copy of that Supreme Court Judge's letter? If you simply inform them something, by way of the line of our preaching logic and authority, gradually they may come to know about us and help us. But one thing is, our experience is that such big men will not help us---except if there is some rare soul like Mr. George Harrison, and they must be guided also by our personally contacting them again and again and slowly build-up the relationship. We are more interested that the mass of men shall support us---what good a handful of high-class supporters will do? Just like in your country, there was election, and the opponent of Mr. Nixon, he was supported by all high-class men, but because Mr. Nixon had help of the common men he was successful and won the fight. But, if even __one__ such high-class man becomes __preacher__ on our behalf, if he actually becomes converted to Krishna Consciousness preaching work, then that is the best contribution of your preaching also. Just like George, now he is practically converted and he is only preaching about Krishna, and he has done that from the beginning---I think you knew him in London also, so you know how he is helping us push on the preaching---so __that__ type of big personality, if you can catch one or two such men for preaching contribution, oh, that will be wonderful achievement for you. We want that the mass shall support us, but we want that the class shall preach for us, that is the distinction. Is it clear? Please inform me from time to time how that programme, of inducing influential men to preach somehow or other our Krishna philosophy is progressing. I know that you have got good ability to do that work, I remember how you used to bring so many big men to see me in London, at that John Lennon's house. So if you sincerely desire to serve Him in that way, Krishna will give you every opportunity and intelligence how to seize it up, that He says:

> tesam satata-yuktanam
> bhajatam priti-purvakam
> dadami buddhi-yogam tam
> yena mam upayanti te
> [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]]

Hoping this meets you and your nice wife, Janaki, in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
