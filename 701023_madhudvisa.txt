My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 15, 1970. I am so much pleases that you are carrying on the Street Sankirtana Party as we have instituted in the Western countries even though you have sometimes only one companion. This spirit is most satisfactory and this work is proven as the basis of our successful movement in the United States, so please go on more enthusiastically than ever with my blessings and you may rest assured that Krsna will always help you in any difficulty.

Please keep the standard in our Calcutta center and certainly things will be further increased by Krsna's grace.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
