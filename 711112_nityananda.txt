My dear Nityananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 20th October, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am very pleased to know that your temple is doing nicely and that there are sincere souls trying to understand this Krishna Consciousness process. You must always remain very serious and enthusiastic about chanting and hearing the message of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, and set a good example for the new devotees to follow.

Bhakti Yoga is the process for all the ages, but the method is different in each age. The rascal people have got some idea of Bhakti according to their whims. Some meditate on light, but real meditation means to concentrate on Krishna.

An example of summary punishment is this: If you are sentenced to be hanged but instead you are given a simple pinprick, that is very nice. Krishna minimizes the devotee's suffering to the lowest. So long as one is engaged in devotional service, he is immune to the reactions of his past sinful activities, but if he chooses to give up this devotional service, then he has to undergo all these reactions.

For all devotees chanting, attending arati ceremony, taking prasadam and attending classes is compulsory. If it is possible, everyone may go on sankirtana.

Principally there are four sampradayas; Nimbarka sampradaya coming from the four Kumaras; Sri Sampradaya coming from Laksmi; Rudra Sampradaya coming from Lord Siva; and Brahma Sampradaya. Vivasvan is in the Brahma Sampradaya. All the sampradayas are related with one another because the conclusion is the same: that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities are His eternal servants.

It is a basic principle that one must accept a bona fide spiritual master in order to achieve the highest perfection of life, love of God. I thank all of you very much for accepting me as your spiritual master, and I promise that I will take you back to home, back to Godhead. I ask you all to promise me to always chant at least 16 rounds, follow the regulative principles, read our books and try to preach this Krishna Consciousness Movement all over the world. So far my qualifications are concerned, I am simply trying to carry out the order of my Guru Maharaja.

Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
