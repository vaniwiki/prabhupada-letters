My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. Just on the point of posting this letter I have received one package from you containing the certificate form and letter. It is very nice. I am replying your letter separately. Hope this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
