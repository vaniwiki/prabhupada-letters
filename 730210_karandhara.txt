Dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of 1/24/73 concerning polygamy and feel that this policy must be strictly prohibited within our society. If it is not it shall only cause chaos, as what was possible under the system of pure Vedic Culture is impossible at the present time.

Regarding Syamasundara's opinions I never approved those ideas should be circulated. If anyone strictly follows the regulative principles of Krishna Consciousness then he will always remain enthusiastic and dynamic. So if there are any defects within our Society it is only symptom that the instructions of the Spiritual Master are being neglected. Follow my instructions strictly and always think for giving this gift of Krishna Consciousness wherever you go and to whomever you meet, this is the advice of Lord Caitanya.

So you GBC men now decide how to manage things so nicely so that I may spend my time solely for translating my books. This I desire. Each GBC man can act as my secretary for one month at a time as I originally planned. In this way you will all be trained up nicely. Syamasundara Prabhu will returning to London in order to get that building.

Your suggestions about marriage are very nice. Marriage is a great responsibility and should not be taken lightly.

I shall be in Sydney until the 18th, and shall be returning to India by the first week of March after visiting New Zealand and Indonesia. As Sudama Maharaja has indicated his desire to remain in U.S. Japan may be included in your GBC zone for the present. I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

I have had Bali Mardan Maharaja send you one telegram approving your scheme to purchase the apartment building for the M-V Trust.
