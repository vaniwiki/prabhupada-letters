My dear Sons and Daughters,

Please accept my blessings. Upon the recommendation of Pusta Krishna Swami I have gladly consented to accept all of you as my duly initiated disciples. Your beads have been duly chanted by me and they are sent by separate post. I have given you spiritual names as follows:

Sandy Van Horn/ Santi devi dasi\\
Debra Perry/ Vinode Vani devi dasi\\
Geoffrey Perry/ Giridhari dasa

I am so glad to learn that all of you have been such a great help to Pusta Krishna there in our Houston center. If you stick to our principles with determination, then you will become free from all attachment to amaya, by Krishna’s Grace. The example is that when the sun is in the sky, there is no question of darknes_ . Similarly, when Hare Krishna Mnatra is vibrating on your tongue and you are hearing attentively, then your consciousness bec____ clear or Krishna Consciousness, and there is no question o_________ or hazy consciousness. Just as when the light and the d____ come together, the darkness cannot stand before the lig__ ___ cannot stand before the presence of Krishna. Always r________ therefore to Chant Hare Krishna, at least 16 rounds ____________ read our literatures daily, go for street sankirtan _________________ will save you in all circumstances without a doubt.


Hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever wel_ ______
