My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for the __Krishna__ Tape #13 along with your letter of July 12, 1969, and I am enclosing herewith Tape #16. Now I shall expedite work on the __Krishna__ book, as I have completed __The Nectar of Devotion.__ Please let me know exactly how far you have finished the __Bhagavatam__ thus far. I am glad that Giriraja is doing very nicely. Krishna has sent a good soul for pushing on this Krishna Consciousness Movement. Please keep him nicely. As of yet I have not received the money which you have mentioned in your letter. Regarding your nice Sankirtana collections, this should be kept in a separate account so that it may help in some great emergency. You should become a little spendthrift. I know that you do this, but still I am reminding you. I am so pleased that you will be holding a grand scale Rathayatra Ceremony, and in London also they are planning a very glorious function with at least 5,000 guests participating.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
