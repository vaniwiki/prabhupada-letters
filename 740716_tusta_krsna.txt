====== Letter to: Tusta Krsna ======

Melbourne

My dear Tusta Krishna Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I am here in Dallas, and after two days I am going to New Vrindaban, and then to London on my way to India. I will reach India by July 26th to arrange for our grand festival in Vrindaban.

I cordially invite you to attend our opening ceremony in Vrindaban because all of our sannyasis will be present there. You also come there as a regular sannyasi and take part. That is my desire.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
