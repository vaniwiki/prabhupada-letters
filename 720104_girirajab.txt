Madras

My dear Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 31st, 1971. From your letter it appears that you are doing nicely distributing books and if you say that with help you could make at least one life member daily, then why not continue on in Madras for a month as you suggest or until there is no more field. But now we have received a telegram from you saying you are going to Calcutta. Now that two men have gone to join you and books have just been sent today what is the need to leave so soon? It is not good that every time there is need of a collector that you are the only one who can go. The best thing will be that you remain in Madras as long as there is a good field for distributing books and making members. When the field is dry then you can go to Calcutta. So I have sent you a telegram reading:

"Your letter December 31. If Madras business is going on nicely disregard Tamalas telegram Remain Madras Letter follows."

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
