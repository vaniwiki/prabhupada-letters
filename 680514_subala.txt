My dear Subala,

Please accept my blessings, I am in due reciept of your letter dated May 9, 1968. It is very nice that Hal Pappa is coming to our temple. Please hand over the enclosed letter which I write to him out of my natural affection for him. I think if he joins with you you will feet more encouraged in the service of the Lord.

I thank you one more for your endeavors in the service of the Lord, and We must bless you and help you in all respects. Hope you a are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
ACB
