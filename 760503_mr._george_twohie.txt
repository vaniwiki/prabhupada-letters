Mr. George Twohie,\\
State Department,\\
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir,

I have been informed through one of my disciples that one application for negotiating a house owned by the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi has not yet reached your Washington office. In order to expedite matters, I am enclosing one "true" copy of the original application dated March 27, 1976, and addressed to the Ambassador of the United States in New Delhi. I am hopeful that we may be able to meet in this concern when I visit Washington between July 2 and July 9, 1976.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
