My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your two letters, one dated August 5th and the other dated August 14th, and I have noted the contents. I understand that the machine is already in the IBM office in Columbus and it will be delivered by the 22nd instant. I do not know why you arranged for rental payment. You say "if the machine works satisfactorily." Does it mean that there is chance of the machine not working satisfactorily? Now if you make experiment for the first month, does it mean that if the experiment fails we lose the first month's rental? I could not follow what does it mean. In the beginning we thought and consulted in so many ways and then settled up to purchase the machine. Why have you now decided to rent it and make an experiment? This is puzzling. I think the machine must work satisfactorily, and therefore, from the beginning you can purchase it as already settled up. Thus you can purchase without delay, and upon receipt of the machine you immediately begin composing the book, __Nectar of Devotion.__ If there are no diacritic marks, we can put the diacritic marks by pencil carefully. That will not be difficult. So immediately on receipt of the machine the book composition must begin. I am asking Hayagriva to come to Columbus along with his wife immediately to begin the work. I am very much anxious to get my books somehow or other, so don't delay the matter. Immediately you should not bother about the Sanskrit typewriter.

Regarding the church on 16th Avenue, if it is possible to take this on rental, it is very nice place, and you can organize a similar temple as the one in Los Angeles. Yes, as suggested by you the householders should take charge of the maintenance of the temple. Jaya Gopala is very enthusiastic boy. He should be given all sorts of encouragement. Then he alone can manage the whole thing. I have got Bengali __Caitanya-caritamrta__ in New York, so don't order anything present. I do not know why you want to subscribe to the Gaudiya paper. Rather you ask Brahmananda to send them a copy in exchange of our copy. But their behavior is not at all satisfactory. We are sending our __BTG__ in three places and they haven't got even the etiquette to send even one almanac. If you want to learn Bengali, there are many sources. Simply Caitanya-caritamrta will be sufficient. I shall deliver to you my old copy when I go to New York on the way to Europe. Don't worry. Your immediate attention is to make the book composition perfect, in cooperation with Arundhati, Hayagriva and Syama Dasi. When it is nicely done and it is in due course, then you can divert your attention to other subject matters.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
