My dear Mr. Seibert,

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due reciept of your letter dated September 27th, 1974. I am glad to hear that you are determined to fight maya and take up this Krishna Consciousness philosophy. So go on reading my books and attending the temple regularly. By this process your spiritual life will develop. You should also be sure to chant 16 rounds on your beads if possible. This is the recommended way to become Krishna Conscious in this age of Kali. In this age it is very difficult to become God Conscious, but if we receive the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu who is the most merciful of all incarnations, as certified by Srila Rupa Goswami, then certainly we will be successful in our attempt for spiritual life. So this is the movement of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and if you take advantage of it you will see how your attraction to material life diminishes in proportion to your attraction for Krishna, which will increase more and more.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
