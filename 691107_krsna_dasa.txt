====== Letter to: Krsna dasa ======

My dear Krishna das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated November 4, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. Regarding my going there, the first thing is that if I speak, one has to translate into German. That does not make any good speech; it hampers the natural flow of the speech and makes it not very much impressive. If you think the major portion of the audience can understand directly English, then it is much better. I am not very much enthusiastic to speak in a place where English is not directly understood. Besides that, I am expecting to be engaged in important business here, which will be ascertained on Monday next, November 10th. At that time I shall decide whether I shall go. If there is no very important engagement, then I shall go to Hamburg, and the decision will be informed to you by telegram on the 10th instant. You will have enough time for advertising because the meeting will be held sometime on the 23rd. So you will get confirmation at least 10 days in advance.

In the package you received from India, did you get Deities also. If not, then the same Deities I had there will go back to Germany for being installed. If in your store you can sell musical instruments and other goods imported from India, then I shall give you good addresses for such imports. I do not know what further instructions you need for constructing the altar. You have got the picture. If you need another picture, then I shall send it.

To celebrate the Rasa Lila Ceremony decorate the Deities very nicely with flowers; as many as possible, ornaments, garlands, nice light demonstration, and much distribution of Prasadam. That will be a very nice day for opening the Radha-Krishna Temple. So if by chance I do not go, then Tamala Krishna, who is arriving in London this Monday, will go. He and Yamuna are both expert in the matter of Deity decoration, so there will be no difficulty for the opening ceremony. So arrange for this ceremony without fail, and let me know immediately if you have got a pair of Radha-Krishna Deities in the new consignment. If not, the Deities with me will go back there.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
