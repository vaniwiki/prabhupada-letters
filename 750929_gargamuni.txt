My dear Gargamuni Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25/8/75 and have noted the contents. Regarding the disturbance made by the women devotees, they are also living beings. They also come to Krishna. So consciously I cannot deny them. If our male members, the brahmacaris and the sannyasis, if they become steady in Krishna consciousness, there is no problem. It is the duty of the male members to be very steady and cautious. This can be done by regular chanting like Haridasa Thakura did. Whenever there is a young woman, we should remember Haridasa Thakura and beg his mercy to protect us, and we should think that these beautiful gopis are meant for the enjoyment of Krishna.

It is a dilemma for our Society that we cannot deny these girls, and at the same time they are a great dangerous allurement to the young boys. Yes, as you say, I never think in terms of Indian or American regarding my students. I take you all as part and parcels of Krishna.

Regarding your program, that is your fortune, that wherever you go, you do nicely. One thing is that in your absence the Calcutta center is not being managed very nicely. You were making progress for making a Calcutta temple. Who is there who can do that now? Those men cannot do that. Anyway you are doing greater service there by distributing so many magazines and also books.

Your program of travelling to Europe and then by vehicles to India is a very good idea. I quite appreciate that idea. Do it. Come to India and preach. Six months in America and six months in India. Such a program of world touring work is very nice, and you are the competent person to execute this program. At the same time chant Hare Krishna regularly. That is my request.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
