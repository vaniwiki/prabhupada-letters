My dear Janajanmadhih das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 31, 1975 and have noted the contents. So, if you are strong enough to preach Krsna consciousness there, that is very good; that as long as you chant your 16 rounds and follow the four regulative principles, then you will get the strength. The process is that you should memorize the purports of my books and then speak them in your own words. Do not adulterate or change anything. Then you will be the perfect preacher. You should also distribute our books as far as possible. If you do this sincerely, then you will be successful.

I hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
