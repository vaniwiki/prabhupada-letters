My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I am just in receipt of your letter forwarded from New York. Please be happy in separation. I am separated from my Guru Maharaja since 1936 but I am always with him so long I work according to his direction. So we should all work together for satisfying Lord Krishna and in that way the feelings of separation will transform into transcendental bliss.

Hope you are well. I am very anxious to know about the church. If they do not agree then take back the check.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
