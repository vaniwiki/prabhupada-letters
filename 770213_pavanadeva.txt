Dist. Nadia, West Bengal, INDIA

Dear Pavanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of 27 January and heard the contents.

No, do not give up the association of devotees. All of your comings and goings are due to restlessness. Use your money to come to Mayapur and associate with the devotees. This restlessness will be cured.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
