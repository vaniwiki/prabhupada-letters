My dear Sri Kanungo,

Please accept the blessings of Lord Caitanya. I thank you for your kind letter dated March 24th, 1975 and I have noted the contents carefully. I am sending my disciple Gaura Govinda dasa brahmacari as my representative. Please give him all facilities and help him to do as is necessary. He will in form you of any other details you may need to know.

Thanking you, I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
