My dear Gunagrahi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 23rd September, 1971 and have noted the contents. It is very nice to hear of your credit course. Continue in this way and Krishna will surely give you all facility.

Enclosed please find one letter for initiates as well as two copies of Gayatri mantra and two sacred threads also duly chanted on. Two beads duly chanted by me have been sent under separate post. Hold a fire yajna and give Gayatri mantra to Kavi and Atmarama. Rupanuga has a tape of me reciting Gayatri mantra, so you can get this from him. One thing is that the tape should be heard through earphones into the right ear. So the fire yajna can be held for all four devotees.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
