My dear Caru das: 

Please accept my blessings.

I have received a letter from Mr. J. R. D. Sharma dated Nov. 30, 1976, regarding his Deities. They should be returned. What is the use of keeping Sarasvati? We do not require to worship any other Deity besides Radha Krishna.

> antavat tu phalam tesam 
> tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam 
> devan deva-yajo yanti
> mad-bhakta yanti mama pi

“Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet”. (Bg 7.23)

So please return his Deities and avoid any dispute. May this letter find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
