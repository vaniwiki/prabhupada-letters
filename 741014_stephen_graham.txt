Dear Stephen Graham:

Please accept my best wishes. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 14, 1974 forwarded to me from my London center. I am very glad to note your interest in Krishna consciousness. So you should come and life with us at one of our centers and practice Krishna consciousness, following the devotional practices, and chanting Hare Krishna.

We have our centers in London, or if you like you can come here to Mayapur where we have got a very nice temple and open land. Anyway, if you are sincere, Krishna will help you in all respects. It is said that according to one's sincere desire to have Krishna, Krishna leads one to a bona fide pure devotee of Krishna, and that pure devotee, he is qualified to lead one to Krishna.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
