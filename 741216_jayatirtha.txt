My dear Jayatirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 5, 1974. Regarding the GBC meeting to be held in Mayapur 1975, the meeting should be held five days before the actual festival is to begin and it will be held in my presence. As far as your proposals are concerned the real thing is that we must make broader constitution of the management by GBC. But the difficulty is that our GBC men are falling victim to maya. Today I trust this GBC and tomorrow he will fall down. That is the difficulty. If the GBC men are so flickering then what to speak of the others. Unless this problem is solved whatever we may resolve it will not be very useful. We shall discuss this at our meeting. If the GBC men can ever manage properly then I shall get some time for writing my books.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have just spoken to Bhagavan dasa who received your call today. If by Krsna's grace, things go well here, then I may be coming to Honolulu in two weeks. Thank you for keeping the temple in sound condition. Please make sure that sankirtana, classes, etc. all continue without fail.\\
