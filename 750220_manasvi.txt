====== Letter to: Manasvi ======

Honolulu

My dear Manasvi dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am very interested to hear of your progress there in Hawaii. Are things going nicely there? How is Siddhasvarupa Maharaja doing? How is his preaching? How are the people accepting? You can write me these things promptly. You should send the letter to Dallas, Gurukula. You are very intelligent devotee, so always keep yourself strong in Krishna Consciousness by following all of the regulative principles very very carefully.

This will save you from the attack of Maya.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
