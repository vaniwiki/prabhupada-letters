My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 4th September, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am glad to learn that you have decided to not go to nightclubs but be engaged with Sankirtana party on the streets. That is very nice. Simply depend on Krishna and there will be no difficulty. So far your keeping your job is concerned, if you are still engaged in that dishwashing job, you should give it up. That kind of work is meant for sudras, not for the brahmanas.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
