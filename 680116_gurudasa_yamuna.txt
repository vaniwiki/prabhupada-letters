Dear Guru das & Yamuna devi,

Be good boy and girl and always chant the HARE KRISHNA mantra and you will be so pleased with the result.

Yamuna you are little better than Janaki but don't get puffed up and be good to those a little less fortunate. Guru das your work is so nice and you are a very important member of our society. You and your wife work so well there shall never be any problems.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
