New Vrndavana

My dear Damodara Pandita dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note dated June 12, 1975 and have received the check for 500 dollars. You can thank Kirtanananda Swami for me since he has given the donation. I will be seeing you all there in New Vrndavana after I visit the Rathayatra festivals and some other temples here in America.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
