====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

Bombay

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your express delivery letter, and I am glad that you have chosen the right course of action to sue Nair and finish the business once and for all. We are prepared to take back the money and cancel the whole thing. Why doesn't he return? Now stick to the principles of the original agreement to file suit. Don't change your decision. It appears that from the building fund Rs. 29,000/- was transferred to International Society general account, it is not yet returned, neither the Rs. 70,000/-. Anyway, the cheques given to you must be torn-up immediately. A letter should be issued to the bank to stop payment for cheques #CHT/A-T 492833 from Building Fund and #GT/HS 306873 from Book Fund, both in favor of Ambhubhai and Diwanji, Solicitors, Bombay, but I shall do it. We shall make no compromise with Nair unless we come to the court.

Enclosed please find the copy of one notice drafted by a lawyer friend visiting Vrindaban, so if you are able to utilize it.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
