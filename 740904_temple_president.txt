Dear Mr. President:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your invitation for August 17, 1974 to attend the installation of Radha Krishna in your temple. I was not able to attend due to being here in India for the opening of our temple here in Vrindaban. Anyway that program has been postponed until the construction work is completed. So I will be glad to know from you how you have installed Their Lordships in your temple. If possible send me photographs.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
