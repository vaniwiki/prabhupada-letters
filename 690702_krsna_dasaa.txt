====== Letter to: Krsna dasa ======

My dear Krishna Das,

Please accept my blessings. After receiving your letter of July 2nd, as mentioned above, I have been anxiously awaiting to receive the ticket that you say you have sent. Please write immediately as to the position of this ticket as I am much concerned about the situation, (Whether it is lost?). Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
