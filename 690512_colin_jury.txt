====== Letter to: Colin Jury ======

My dear Colin Jury,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your nice letter (undated). Practically, our Krishna Consciousness movement is based on transcendental pleasure. Music, dancing and feasts are the chief items for pleasure, and this pleasure is originally on the transcendental realm. They are simply reflected pervertedly in the material world, and every living entity has natural inclination for these three items. So Krishna Consciousness is to go back to the original position. Therefore, music and dancing can be purified for transcendental realization. Factually we do not reject anything, but we will accept anything as favorable for Krishna's service. In other words, we can dovetail anything in Krishna's service, and thus purify the contaminated covering of everything. So your talents for music may be employed fully for the cause of serving Krishna.

Several days ago I got three pairs of boys and girls married, and this married life is different from the material married life. The example is already there in London how six disciples there are all working so nicely in pushing the Krishna Consciousness movement. Actually, we are trying to give real life to the human society by purifying the activities in Krishna Consciousness. The method is very simple: By chanting Hare Krishna one becomes purified immediately and by constant practice, there is no chance of being contaminated again. Please continue to follow there principles, and your life will surely be sublime.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
