My dear Lokananda das, and Ramesvarai dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated October 17 and October 20, 1975. With regard to your son, let him see the Deity and ask him to offer obeisances. He will see and learn it. Yes, the body is received according to karma, still it is not an impediment to advance in Krsna consciousness by being deaf. Just teach him to see the Deity and how to offer obeisances and he will take prasadam. These things will elevate him to Krsna consciousness. Later on if Krsna desires, he can develop his hearing power. Krsna is almighty and He can do whatever He likes. What is the use of the karmi deaf school. Better to sit him down before the Deity and see and offer obeisances.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
