====== Letter to: Ādi-kesava ======

Allston, Massachusetts

My dear Adikesava das;

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 20th. Please accept my blessings. I have also received the enclosed photographs which are very nice. Regarding taking the Deities out on travelling sankirtana, I think you can take guidance from Visnujana Maharaja and Tamala Krishna Goswami who are giving you the example in this connection.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
