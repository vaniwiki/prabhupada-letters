Dear Prosantaji,

Please accept my greetings and blessings of Lord Krishna. This is to inform you that in spite of my writing to so many Mukutwalas and Murtiwalay I am receiving no reply to my letters. Last Month I wrote some reminding letters to Ram Natha Murtiwala, but this also has gained no reponse. I am wondering if you have any information as to what is the difficulty in this connection. I shall be glad to receive your letter by return of post.

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
