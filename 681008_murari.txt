My dear Murari,

Please accept my blessings. While I was in San Francisco you were arranging for going to Hawaii. Now I understand that you have gone to New York, so I do not know whether you have changed your program. If not, I shall be glad to know when you are going to Hawaii. I understand from the letter of Gaurasundara that expert carpenters can get immediately good job there, at least $5.00 per hour. So if you go there, I think there will be no difficulty for you. Anyway, I shall be glad to know your program, whether you are going to Hawaii in the near future or not.

Gaurasundara is doing there some work, but that is not sufficient even for maintaining an apartment. He is of course searching for a better job, but I do not think alone he can start a center there. He writes to say that the rents there are very expensive. So I shall be glad to hear from you.

Mahapurusa is going today to Florida, and will reach there by tomorrow. But anywhere, one man show is not very prospective. So if you go to Hawaii and try to open a center, please let me know what is your program.

Please offer my blessings to Lilavati and your daughter. Hope this finds you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
