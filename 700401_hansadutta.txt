My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th March, 1970. I have duly received your $300 transferred from Germany and I understand that you are transferring another $1,500 to my account. The mail strike is already over. I am enclosing herewith a letter for Himavati, giving her instruction.

So far Sankirtana is concerned, I am so much pleased to learn that you are taking Sankirtana as your life and soul. There is no doubt about Krsna's being pleased very much upon those who are engaged in such Sankirtana Movement, that is admitted by Lord Krsna in the Bhagavad-gita and Caitanya Caritamrta. Some of the best students like you, Tamala, Mukunda, Syamasundara, and Jaya Govinda, are all now in Europe. Now you form a strong party for opening centers as well as organizing the World Sankirtana Party.

This Sankirtana Party, backed by literatures and books, will certainly bring in a great change in the modern civilization. Godless civilization can never be happy. Therefore as soon as they become Krsna conscious, they will feel practical happiness without any doubt.

I am so glad that Sivananda is going to be married with a German girl; and similarly, Krsna das may be also married. My Guru Maharaja created some Brahmacaris and Sannyasis for preaching work, and I am creating all Grhasthas. This means that we have to adjust things in favor of circumstances in the matter of pushing Krsna Consciousness Movement forward.

By correspondence, I am trying to secure a great quantity of Deities and mrdangas from India, so we must utilize them by opening various center, which means we must have sufficient manpower, and this will depend on your Sankirtana Party. Then everything will go on nicely.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
