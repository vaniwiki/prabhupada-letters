Dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I have received a letter from Yasodanandana Maharaja in Japan dated March 31 in which he writes that he has become very disturbed by reports he says you are making that he and Gurukrpa Maharaja are not authorized by me, and so many criticisms he alleges you are making against them.

This kind of criticism and counter-criticism is not good. Those who are advanced devotees try to see only the good that other devotees are doing, just as bees are attracted to honey, while flies are attracted to sores. Gurukrpa Maharaja and Yasodanandana Maharaja have gone to Tokyo with my full knowledge for sankirtana and collecting funds for our projects in India. In the past they have collected very nicely and sent $40,000 to India. So let them work peacefully, and you engage yourself fully in Los Angeles and BBT matters. You have great responsibilities in that connection. Let us try to work cooperatively, otherwise the fighting spirit will ruin our great movement.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
