My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th March, 1971 and have noted the contents. In the meantime I have received one letter from Hanuman that one lady is prepared to donate a nice piece of land and $50,000 for erecting a Radha-Krsna Temple. That is very encouraging. If it is a fact, then I can go there for laying down the foundation stone and from there it may be easier to go to Sydney. So after hearing from you, I shall let you know definitely.

I have received one letter from Christopher Warden dated 17th March, 1971. Please thank him and you may inform him that I am sending his beads by separate post.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
