Dear Sir:

Re: My savings bank account No. 1452

With reference to your letter No. FEX.22/-277, I beg to inform you that your Calcutta office denies to have received any amount from your transfer of Rs. 6,000 as per your debit note dated 22.1.70. Their letter Number is SB/34/1109, dated 18 February, 1970.

Kindly enlighten me immediately why they have denied to have received the money from you. Please treat this as urgent, and oblige.

Thanking you in anticipation of an early reply.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
