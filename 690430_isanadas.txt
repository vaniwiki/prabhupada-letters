My dear Isanadas,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 25, 1969, and I have noted the contents with pleasure. I am pleased that you are taking serious interest in helping us spread this sublime movement of Lord Caitanya to the Western World, which has such urgent need of this knowledge. Regarding your idea of going to London before they obtain a temple, I do not think this will be the best thing because already they are scattered there, living separately, and they are inconvenienced. I have asked them to occupy a building and assured them of guarantee of payment. If the building is occupied, then by June I shall also go there, and then you will be welcome there. But without having a temple there I do not think it will be very much beneficial. Now you are helping the Montreal temple, and that is nice.

I am glad to learn of your policy of occupants in your building. If that house can develop into a students home, preaching our philosophy to the residents, it will be a great service. Make it a point that at a certain period of time there should be lecture about Krishna consciousness and some kirtana. This time should be fixed up for all residents. So if they take part in kirtana and have opportunity to hear our philosophy, certainly they will take it up. Side by side, if our prasadam program is also introduced, that will also be great impetus.

Regarding Vibhavati's plan of natural childbirth, this is very good. Since your wife is pregnant, let her be engaged with some little work, That will help her natural childbirth. I have read your suggestions for improving __Back To Godhead__ and they are very good. You are acquainted with Rayarama, so please write your suggestions to him. But I like these ideas you have suggested.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Vibhavati, and I hope this will meet the both of you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

NB: Your suggestion of sending me a report of your daily activities is very nice, and you may do it.
