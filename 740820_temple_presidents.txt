====== Letter to: Temple Presidents ======

To: Presidents,\\
New York, Dallas

My dear Mr. President:

Please accept my blessings. This is to introduce you to Mr. & Mrs. Malkani of Bombay. They are coming to U.S.A. on August 27, 1974. Please receive them nicely and provide whatever accommodation they may require.

Mr. Malkani is a cook and can teach how to prepare nice foodstuffs. He also knows of our idea for the Hare Krishna Restaurants.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
