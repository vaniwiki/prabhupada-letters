My dear Gopala Krishna das:

Please accept my blessings. I am sending you one copy of a letter to PNB so the bank will pay up to 1 lakh of Rupees. So now complete the negotiation. The bank will guarantee payment. Why you are not completing the negotiation? Pranava is silent. He did not send any message with Nitai so I do not think that he is able to negotiate. If it is ready, then settle up. The money is there in the bank.

I have also given Giriraja 2 lakhs of Rupees but I have not heard anything from him. How has it bee spent?*

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
