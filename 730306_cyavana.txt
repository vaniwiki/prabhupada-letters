My dear Cyavana:

Please accept my blessings and I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 10th of February. There has been some delay in replying because of my travels. I have just arrived here a few days ago and by the 15th I shall be going to Mayapur.

Yes, I should not travel so extensively any more if I am to finish my work on the __Bhagavatam.__ So I am turning over all the management to the GBC and the presidents.

Your program for printing our literature is very encouraging to me because that is our major effort for pushing on this movement, so kindly distribute these literatures far and wide as possible.

The marriage of Hari Kripa with the African girl is alright with me if you and Brahmananda Maharaja agree in the matter, these kinds of decisions I am leaving up to you to make in the future.

I am very glad to hear that the film "Hare Rama" was defeated there, it is Krsna's grace. This man is a very bad man for our movement's sake, that movie is a great insulting to us. I think there was bribe by the government who does not want this movement. Anyway, the dogs may bark but the caravan passes.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
