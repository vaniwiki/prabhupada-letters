My dear Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 27, 1972, along with sample of your booklet. It is very nice, I have enjoyed it very much, but there are some direct criticisms and that we are not going to do. These men are not so important than our institution, so we shall not give them unnecessary publicity by criticizing. We shall consider it later after reading more carefully. Thank you very much. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
