My dear Gadi dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 13, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for the $20 donation. Thank you for helping me in this preaching work. Make sure that you preach nicely and at the same time follow the example of perfect behavior given by your spiritual master and the previous acaryas and confirmed in the scriptures. Always remain fixed in the service of Krishna and you will be untouched by Maya.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
