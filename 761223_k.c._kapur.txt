My dear K.C. Kapur,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 10, 1976.

Thank you very much for the offer of the use of your place in Allahabad during the Kumbha. Yes, most probably we are going. I shall let you know later on. I will give your address to my disciple who is organizing our camp there.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
