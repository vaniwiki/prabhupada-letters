====== Letter to: Upendra ======

Sydney

My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 20th April, 1970, with newspaper clippings enclosures, and they are all every encouraging.

Don't worry about your wife, she is trying to get immigration visa and Madhudvisa is helping her. In the meantime, I am enclosing herewith a copy of the police officer's letter to me and I hope this will help you to get police permission for Sankirtana.

We are the best peaceful group in the world and we are trying to bestow upon the people the supermost knowledge for the humanity. Everyone should cooperate with us, but unfortunately this is the age of Kali and people are not very much eager to accept genuine things, so don't be disappointed. Do as you are doing now and Krsna will help you without fail. To face difficulty in the course of preaching work is a kind of austerity. These difficulties do not go in vain. The more we face difficulties, the more we draw the attention of Krsna. So in that way we shall be prepared to meet all kinds of difficulties in our preaching work. Such attempt gives us a lift on our progressive march in Krishna Consciousness.

In my last letter to Bali Mardan I have already written that I was very much anxious to hear from you. Now this letter has given me much relief. Thank you very much that you are working so hard for this movement, and surely Krsna will reward sufficiently for your transcendental labor. Be blessed and preach.

I shall send you very soon detailed photographs of our new temple room and I think you will very much appreciate it.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
