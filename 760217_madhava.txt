My dear Madhava das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and article entitled "Matter Comes from Life".

It is very nice and why not publish in BTG? It must be published in BTG. And you must also publish in other journals. That is our business. Let them protest or accept. If they protest, we will reply them again. If they accept, then that is victory. It must be recognized that we are not just a religious sect. People are being kept in darkness, so we are trying our best to give this to the world; we must work in that spirit and become qualified.

Regarding your questions, matter originally is spirit and when spirit is not distinctly understood, that is matter. Just like a tree is also a manifestation of spirit soul, but the consciousness is covered. When the tree is cut, it does not protest. But the moving entity has stronger consciousness than the tree. There is consciousness in the tree though. Also consciousness in a dormant state is matter; consciousness in a completely developed state is spirit. Matter is the symbol of undeveloped consciousness.

Thinking is a subtle form of matter. Just like it says in Bhagavad-gita: "__bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh__ . . . [[books:bg:7:4|(Bg. 7.4)]]." Like the ether is subtle, the mind is more subtle---subtle form of matter.

As for your third question is concerned everything is in the spiritual world. Krishna is the sum total of spirit and everything is coming from Him. __Aham sarvasya prabhavo__ . . . [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]]. Matter, spirit, everything comes from Him. He is the supreme life, the origin of spirit and life. Therefore matter emanates from life. __Nityo nityanam__ . . . He is the Supreme Consciousness of all other consciousness.

The moon is situated 1,600,000 miles above the sun. You may refer to the fifth canto and read carefully.

By the grace of Krishna you are already able to increase your service to me.

It is very nice to hear that the students and teachers appreciate our philosophy. Your program will also help them. I am very much pleased with your program. Thank you very much.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
