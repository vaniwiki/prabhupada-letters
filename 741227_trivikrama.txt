My dear Trivikrama Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received one telegram from Brahmananda Swami. He said that there is one Chinese initiated devotee there who is giving money and has already translated three chapters of __Bhagavad-gita.__ This is very wonderful. You can immediately print those first three chapters of __Bhagavad-gita__ into a book. And let him translate three more chapters and then print that into a book. Then three more etc., etc. In this way we can introduce our __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ in Hong Kong also. He also stated that the temple can be maintained by the Indians. That is good. Let them give some donation for Krsna's service and gradually they will also become Krsna Conscious. Brahmananda Swami seemed to think that you need more men there. His telegram reads, "Trivikrama alone, more men required urgently." I do not understand what he means by alone. What is this alone? Vaisnava is never alone. When I first came to the United States I was seemingly alone for one year. But I never felt alone. I always felt the presence of my Guru Maharaja. Myself, I was cooking, I was printing books, I was selling books, everything seemingly alone. But I did not lose my determination. Actually you should know this, you are never alone. So local men are coming daily. By good association, good preaching, nice prasadam etc., they can all become devotees. This is Lord Caitanya's mission to go to every town and village and create Vaisnava spirit in the local men. I have also sent one letter to Pancadravida Swami in Bangkok that his party can come there sometimes for big programs if you can arrange. Keep in touch with them. Their address is; Pancadravida Swami, c/o D.H. Carturchand, 238 Samteng St. Bangkok, Thailand. Please keep yourself strong and fixed up in Krsna's service by following all of our regulative principles, chanting 16 rounds daily, rising early, attending mangala arati and attending classes. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
