time now for editing __Caitanya Caritamrta.__ If he has got time, he can get one copy of Bengali __Caitanya Caritamrta.__ I can spare my own copy for which he hasn't got to pay me anything. Or else, if he likes, he can purchase a new copy from the New York temple. If Gaurasundara is too busy however, you can work on the lecture tapes.

I am so glad to know that you are soon to complete the Dr. Frog story, and I shall be anxious to see the final result. It is also very nice that you are performing arati regularly, and you are planning to make it more elaborate very soon. I have received a letter from Murari that you desire me to go to Hawaii after the rainy season is over. I think that will be very nice. In the meantime you settle up things there more strongly. I Have got good faith in your husband, and I know that he can speak very nicely on our philosophy. So try to help him as far as possible to keep fit and continue to speak on Krishna philosophy.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
