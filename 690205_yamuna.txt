Dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter of January 22, 1969, and I have duly noted the contents. The reply to your points you will find along with your husbands letter. I am very much anxious to go to London, but I do not know why you are delaying to call me. The legal documents being submitted, there is no impediment to rent a nice house. So you should take this risk, and everything will come out all right. How is Mr. Parikh doing? I hope this will meet you in the best of health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
