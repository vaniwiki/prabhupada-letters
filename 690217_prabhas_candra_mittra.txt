Dear Prabhas Babu,

I thank you very much for your letter (F-54/103) dated February 6, 1969. Regarding the letter of credit, I beg to inform you that I have got good accounts in some of the very respectable banks in America in which there are branches in Calcutta. I am sending herewith one letter of declaration from the Bank of America as well as from the First National City Bank of America for your kind perusal. So, for experimental sake, if you immediately dispatch the following goods and ship them to Los Angeles, your bills with bill of lading will be presented to the Bank of America and will at once be honored. For the time being you can ship the goods by any suitable steamer company to Los Angeles.

In the meantime, I am trying to negotiate with Srimati Morarji. So if you agree, immediately send book the following goods, send me the invoice and upon presentation to the Bank of America (Pico and La Cienega Branch, 85-01 W. Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, Calif.), they will pay the amount of your bill. If you agree to this them immediately send the following goods:

1. 1 first class harmonium with good bellow which sustains without much labor

2. 2 first class mrdangas

3. 5 pairs of big Navadvipa karatalas

4. 1 first class panca pradipa

5. 1 jahanjh (gong)

6. 1 round ghari (good sound)

7. 3 water conch shells

8. 2 blowing conch shells

9. 1 Bengali New Year (1375) panjika

In addition to these items, you may be receiving a letter from Vrindaban about a pair of murtis which are to be sent as a free gift to us.

Thanking you in anticipation of your reply.

Yours truly,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
