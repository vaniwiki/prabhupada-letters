Dear Mark,

Please accept my best wishes. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 22nd December, 1975, along with your contribution. Please continue to chant Hare Krishna, read our books, and associate with the devotees. In this way you will surely become Krishna Conscious.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
