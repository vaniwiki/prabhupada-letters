My dear John Panama,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. Yes, I can help you. But you must want to be helped. Life is not meant for simply eating, sleeping, mating and defending as the animals are doing. It is meant for developing spiritual consciousness or Krishna Consciousness. I think if you could visit one of our temples, it would be very nice for you. We have many temples there on the east coast in Baltimore, Boston, New York, Washington, Philadelphia, etc. I hope you will make the opportunity to go to one of them in the very near future.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. In the meantime, please chant Hare Krishna as often as possible for purification of the heart.\\
