====== Letter to: Yasomatinandana ======

Ahmedabad

My dear Yasomatinandana Prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. You wanted one white assistant for facilitation of your work in Ahmedabad, so we have selected the best man for this work, Sriman Hai Haya Das Adhikari. I understand that you wrote one letter to Gopala Krishna disapproving sending Hai Haya. He is approved manager and why you thought that there is some politics. I am very much surprised to hear all this.

Anyway he is going there, work with him cooperatively and everything will be successful.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
