====== Letter to: Tejiyas ======

New Delhi

My dear Tejiyas das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 26, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the importation of printing paper, it will not be as gift, but it will be paid for from India in foreign exchange. We have sent so much foreign exchange from America and Europe, now we want permission to send out the same amount for purchasing foreign paper. Just like in 1967 when I returned to India. When I wanted to go out, for purchasing my ticket, they would allow only if I had brought in foreign exchange. I showed the bank receipts for encashing the foreign exchange I had brought in, and they immediately granted permission for me to purchase my ticket. So following the same principle we want permission to purchase printing paper up to the amount of foreign exchange that we have sent into the country.

In this connection you can find out in the Import/Export Department on e Mr. Mukherjee who is the son-in-law of the late Mr. N.C. Chatterjee. Mr. Chatterjee was my personal friend, and some 10 years ago promised to help me. So if you find Mr. Mukherjee, he can help you.

Regarding your feeling yourself as unqualified, whatever you can do, then do it, but you should try your best for Krishna. This is important. Ultimately everything is depending on Lord Krishna. You just have to always remember this.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
