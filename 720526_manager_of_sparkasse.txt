To the Manager\\

Dear Sir:

I have got my account in your Hamburg Branch, and the number is 114/332 647. As of 10-9-69 there were 5 DM. only.

I am herewith authorizing one of my students, Mr. Stefan Delhaes to deposit any amount in the above account. He will be coming to your bank shortly for making a deposit and you may compare his signature with that which I am enclosing herewith.

Kindly do the needful and oblige.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
