My dear Gaurasundara, Govinda Dasi, Vamanadeva, Balabhadra, Sudama, and Kartikeya,

Please accept my blessings to all of you. I beg to inform you that I have safely arrived as scheduled in San Francisco, and I am thinking fondly of you all. Cidananda has received one telephone call from Satsvarupa requesting advice as to what should be Jadurani's program, and I have advised that if the doctor wishes Jadurani to go to Hawaii immediately then she should do this. Otherwise she will wait in Boston till after I go there on April 22nd about. So when this matter is decided you will be notified about her arrival there.

I hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood. Please keep me informed to your well-being and the progress of your center.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I am reaching L.A. on 6th and N.Y. on 9th.
