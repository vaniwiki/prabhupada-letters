My dear Bahudak,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your request for initiations.

Upon your recommendation I will accept the following devotees for first initiation, as well as the ones you have recommended for second initiation. Hold a fire ceremony and instruct the devotees to follow the regulative principles and to chant a minimum of 16 rounds every day. Play the tape of me chanting gayatri into the right ear of the second initiates. Their beads may be chanted on by Ramesvara Maharaja. The names of the new initiates are:

Mark L.---Madhu Pandita dasa

Marilyn---Madhava-priya dasi

John B.---Janapati dasa

James H.---Jaya Hari dasa

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
