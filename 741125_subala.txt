My dear Subaladas Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 13, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding your registration, it should be clearly stated that no property can be sold or mortgaged without my express sanction. I am glad to note that you have got three brahmacaris there. Train them up nicely.

Yes I am pleased by your attempt there, and Krishna will bless you undoubtedly. I am always for that purpose. Kindly ask me your problem and I shall try to give you advice. Krishna consciousness can only be increased by chanting, reading our books regularly, and strictly following the rules and regulations.

Krishna is in His name, so He is always present with you. Never think that you are without the association of Krishna. Yes, guru and Krishna are always with you.

So far your health is concerned, so far the body is there the question of health and unhealth will always be there. Sometimes there will be complaints, and sometimes not. In the Gita Krishna says these things come and go like the seasonal changes. So we have to tolerate. Caitanya Mahaprabhu advises __trnad api sunicena/taror api sahisnuna.__ We must be tolerant like the tree and humble like the blade of grass. Such persons can chant the Hare Krishna mantra and preach. In Bombay we are undergoing so many tribulations. What can be done?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
