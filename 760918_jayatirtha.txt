My dear Jayatirtha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 13rd September 1976 and also the BBT Trustees report and have noted the contents with care.

Enclosed please find a letter of authorization to Lloyds Bank Ltd. Southampton Row Branch for a transfer to your account in the same branch of pounds 4,500.00. You may deliver this letter and advise me accordingly. Please save the wood and soundproofing from the Bury Place Temple as it was quite expensive to install.

I think there is a very good scope for preaching in Yugoslavia as the recent reports show a good success there. You should encourage this preaching program and support it fully. I have received today the Spanish Edition of Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.4. They have printed 75,000 copies. Similarly you should print in the German language as many copies as possible. That is my only life. When I see that there is publication of the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other books in other languages that gives me life. It is very nice that you will print in Yugoslavian, Hungarian , Polish and Russian. It is approved by me if you want to give less than 25% of the BBT income for the Mayapur construction as you require to print books. Your scheme for an English magazine for Great Britain is nice. You should print more and more books and increase your inventory.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
