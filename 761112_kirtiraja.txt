My dear Kirtiraja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 2/11/76.

Now you have got good contact in Poland. You must immediately supply the books for the University library. It is a very good order. Yes, encourage them to visit other libraries. It is my earnest desire to have my books translated and published in Russian and Polish. Yes, the translations must be checked. Work with Jayatirtha in that connection. I think __Easy Journey to Other Planets__ will be very much appreciated because it is the scientific basis of our Krishna Consciousness Movement. I approve your plan to relocate to Bhaktivedanta Manor within the next year.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
