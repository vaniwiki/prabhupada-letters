My dear Ambarisa dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 27, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

You should not pay anything without my permission. Who has requested you to give them money? What is this nonsense? Now, you don't give a single paise without first asking my permission.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
