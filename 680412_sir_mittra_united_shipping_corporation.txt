====== Letter to: Sir Mittra, United Shipping Corporation ======

United Shipping Corporation\\
14/2, Old China Bazar Street\\
Room No. 18, Calcutta 1.

Dear Sir Mittra,

I have sent you one letter dated March 23, 1968, the copy of which is enjoined herewith. I do not know why you did not reply this letter of March 23, and I am very much sorry that in the absence of the statement of account on our $500, and the balance remaining with you, I am getting reminders from the New York office. I am proceeding to New York on the 17th of April, 1968, and by that time I hope to receive the reply of my letter of March 23, and __the statement of account showing the balance of money lying with you.__ Please treat this as urgent and oblige.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
