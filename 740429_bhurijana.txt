Dear Bhurijana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 21st and I thank you very much.

It is very good news for me that you are stressing regulative temple life in your new quarters in Hong Kong. The regulative principles are designed to take us gradually to the platform of spontaneous love of Krsna, which is the perfection of human life. Those who think they have already attained such perfection and give up the regulative principles are called sahajiya, or those who take things cheaply and simply imitate. This early rising, holding classes, going out regularly for sankirtana, worshiping the deity are the very substance of devotional life. You will certainly by your sincere devotional example attract more and more sincere Chinese boys and girls to Krsna Consciousness. Even if, due to family ties, they cannot move in the temple, try to engage them as much as possible in translating work, sankirtana, reading, and at least coming to the temple to take prasadam.

I understand you have a new address but you have not described the actual situation. Try to send pictures if you can. How much is the rent? What kind of temple construction are you referring to?

Please give my thanks to your good wife Jagatarini for working with the childrens' classes. I am very very proud of you both as you have given up everything and gone to a far away part of the world just on my order to carry out the will of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, that the chanting of the Holy Name be heard in every town and village.

Of course I will be very eager to see the new Chinese publication. Please go on with it, and send me something as soon as it is published.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
