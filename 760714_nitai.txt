My dear Nitai dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received reports that you have been developing the habit of going outside the temple to hear lectures by others outside like Nrsimhavallabha. Also, I have heard now that even some of the Indian devotees are doing likewise.

Strictly nobody should go outside to hear lectures by others. If you are not satisfied by the calibre of the classes at the Krishna Balarama Mandir, then you should give another class, but you cannot go outside for hearing others' lectures. Kindly stop this habit immediately.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
