Dear Sri Birlaji,

Please accept my greetings. I have received one letter from Sri Balmukund Parikh of 78 Woodstock Avenue, London, N.W. 11, and the copy of the letter is enclosed herewith for your perusal.

Perhaps it may be known to you that in the Western world I am preaching the cult of Krishna Consciousness strictly on the Vaisnava principles, and I have established already 26 centers as listed on enclosed sheet.

I want to establish many Radha Krishna Temples in all important towns and countries of the Western World. I am not only establishing Temples, but I am creating the devotees of the Temples. There are many thousands of disciples in America, Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia. So I am in need of many pairs of Radha Krishna Murtis, and from the letter of Sri Balmukund Parikh I learn that you are interested to donate such Murtis for being installed in different parts of the Western countries.

I understand that four pairs of Murtis have already been donated by your Trust through correspondence with the Secretary of the Dalmia Jayan Trust. But I want many hundreds of pairs of such Murtis. Generally in our Temples we install 24 inches high brass Murtis or 42 inches high marble Murtis. A picture of our London Deities is sent herewith for your inspection.

Thanking you in anticipation of your early reply.

Yours in the service of the Lord,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
