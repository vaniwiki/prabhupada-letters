My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th June, 1970, and noted the contents. I am very glad that you are progressively working on paintings for our all literatures. Thank you very much.

Regarding the cover for "The Lord in the Heart," yes, Lord Visnu should be distinguished by Srivatsa on His chest. The Kaustava jewel should be painted to look just like a very precious jewel. Lord Visnu should be surrounded by effulgence from His person. The first concentration should be on the lotus feet of the Lord. That should be very distinct and very nicely decorated with jewels, sandal pulp and Tulasi.

I am very glad also to know that Satsvarupa is becoming more and more responsible for the Boston temple. That is nice. That I want. I have received his letter of 19th June 1970.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
