My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10th August, 1970, along with a list of schedule for Temple activities. It is very nice program. If you simply follow this program, then the spell of Maya will not be able to enter into your constitution. All Questions and answers are practically given in our books.

I have received two Bhagavatam chapters, “Pure devotional Service” the __arcan __program is very nicely described in verse number 22 specifically. So these books are so valuable for public reading, but some way or other they are not being introduced in proper channel namely the school and college for reading.

I have nominated you as one of the members of the Governing Body because I know you are a very good soul and I shall be very pleased if the mistake which has already crept in our society can be rectified by your combined effort. I have not heard anything about the activities of the four Sannyasis, neither I have received any letter from them.

I have not yet received any letter from Rupanauga about the press questions, but as you know as I have several times mentioned that the press is my heart and soul and it should work constantly to produce literature for wide distribution. Similarly I am trying to engage the Dia Nippon Press for printing our works. Yesterday I have placed with them $32,000 worth business. We have now stock of NOD’s 5,000 at $4 a piece, similarly KRSNA at $8, so by book estimation you have got more than $100,000 worth books in stock. So if we collect only one fourth of it and pay to Dia Nippon then we got another $100,000 worth books. Of course, it is not business proposal, but it is a scheme for distributing widely our literatures. That is my program.

So I hope you are all meeting in New Vrndavana and try to make a strong program how our missionary activities can be pushed on with great stride.

I have advised Karandhar to collect all book funds and send to Dia Nippon wherein I have opened an account “Bhaktivedanta Book Fund Deposit”. The more they receive amounts, the more we print books for distribution.

In the Third Chapter the black border underneath my name does not look very well.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
