Dear Mr. Shah,

I thank you for your letter No. Con63 (1)66 of the 11th instant and it is understood that I may raise the necessary funds from the residents of America.

Would you please send me a list of the Indian residents in America and oblige.

I may also inform you that my followers here, who come regularly and enjoy my Kirtana and discourses on the Bhagavad-gita,---are all citizens of America. Whether I may also raise funds from them.

Kindly reply this letter per return of post so that I may do the needful. Also note my change of address as above mentioned.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
