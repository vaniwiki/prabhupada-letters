My dear Sauri dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated March 22nd, 1977 which has only now reached me having been forwarded to Vrndavana.

Be assured, Krsna will give you all facilities gradually. Your attitude is nice, very humble. Maintain that attitude and gradually you will get all the facilities you require for serving Krsna.

Thank you very much for your nice donation. I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
