My dear Jagadisa dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 20th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you for helping in this situation so nicely. By Krishna's grace we shall be able to remain in that building. For the time being, make sure that the Deity worship is been done nicely and that sankirtana goes on daily. Also the devotees must all follow the rules strictly as well as chant 16 rounds daily and read my books.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
