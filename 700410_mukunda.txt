My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received the karatalas, but it is completely hopeless. The man has cheated us cent per cent, but there is no way to rectify it and we shall wait for future to get the right thing.

I hope everything is going on nicely in your temple, and please keep me informed regularly of the activities. I have not heard from Syamasundara for a long time. I sent him one letter of which I have not received any reply as yet. Please remind him.

Please offer my blessings to all the devotees.

You ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
