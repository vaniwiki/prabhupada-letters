My dear Paramahamsa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 2, 1975 with enclosed check for Dollars 3,000.00. Thank you very much for repaying this money. But I have still not received the Dollars 1,000 you sent c/o Paris. You should inquire into this and inform me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
