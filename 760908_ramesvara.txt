My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 29, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. It is very good that all this business has stopped __sato vrtte sadhu sange.__ Revatinandana Swami is a very good preacher and you should encourage him. He can do nicely.

Let the restaurant go on. This is a very nice plan and I have discussed this with Rsabhadeva das. He may show you some communications on the subject. The householders who cannot sell books should be encouraged to work honestly on this restaurant project.

It will be very nice if you GBC men can relieve me from the heavy burden of management.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
