My dear Nayanabhirama das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your kind appreciation on the Vyasa Puja Day. Your sentiments are appreciated by me. It is stated by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura it is only by pleasing the Spiritual Master that one can be assured of pleasing Krishna. So my only request to my disciples all over the world on this day is to go on pushing on this movement with determination and sincerity, rigidly following the principles I have given you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
