My dear Madhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated August 15th and have noted the contents carefully. I have also looked at the article in Kothari Magazine and it is done very nicely. Thank you very much. I am encouraged to hear that the collecting is going very nicely under your supervision and that you have made 33 Life Members there in Calcutta more. But we shall require huge funds to finish our Mayapur Project, at least Rs./60,000 per month must be collected there, along with donations of kind, such as steel, etc. So if you can assist Jayapataka and the others in this way that is very much appreciated.

One thing is if the Calcutta festival is held at least 50 men must be there and do it very nicely. How many men will be there? On the dates that you mention, namely, October 27th to November 5th, I shall be in Vrndavana. You must all jointly make these decisions about my program there, not that whimsically one man shall decide one thing another man shall decide another thing. So unless Tamala Krsna and the others agree then I will not be able to attend on the dates you have mentioned. Anyway I shall be in Vrndavana at that time. But after the 15th November, leaving this time, and consulting with the leaders, then a suitable program may be fixed for Calcutta.

Regarding my Gita Gan, take quotation for printing there also. If it is cheaper why should we go to Dai Nippon? I think Jugantar can do the work, let them do it conveniently. Anyway, somehow or other do it, and you can request Giriraja to send the money from the Book Fund if he approves of everything. You can ask Asokamrta or I think there are some Bengali girls there also, all of them are well educated, they can proofread the manuscript.

The Maidan programs in India should be done in consultation with all. We have now got our reputation and we must do everything very carefully to keep it. Same process, four or five or six big men, whatever they think the others must say all right I shall accept. Nothing should be done by personal whims. This should be avoided. Our prestige should be always kept, that means we must be very sincere and serious to execute our work; then it will be all right.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
