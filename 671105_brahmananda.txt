====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. Replying your letter dated Oct. 21, I quite appreciate your statement and I am happy that you have now taken care of the Gita Mss. I have already written to Hayagriva that the instructions which I impart are not dogmas. Our instructions are all based on sufficient logic and philosophy. The thing is that while conducting missionary activities it is quite natural that sometimes the situation may become very provocative, but we have to deal in these matters very carefully. The boy who spat upon the person of Kirtanananda must send a letter of regret and apology. That will be nice. You should always try to pacify the living entities in their rebellious propensities. These individual propensities are factual evidence for their becoming individual entities. If everything would have been impersonal there would have been no scope for the individual manifestations. It is understood that Hayagriva will purchase the property at Wilkes-Barr with the help of Dr. Henderson's financial assistance. I do not mind that they will do something separately, but I wish that there may not be any misbehavior between the God-brothers. I think you can write Hayagriva a personal letter regretting the incident which had unfortunately occurred, namely spitting over the person of Kirtanananda. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
