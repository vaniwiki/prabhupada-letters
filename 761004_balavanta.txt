My dear Balavanta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters and financial report dated 26th August and 18th Sept. 1976, and have noted the contents. The airport distribution at New Orleans is very good. Regarding the Lord Jagannatha deities, if They cannot be worshiped, They should be thrown in the sea. I acknowledge receipt of check copy No. 1195 on Bank of New Orleans for $1,000.00, and you may send money as you have done to M.V. Fund, L.A.

Deity worship should not be expanded anymore if it is difficult to manage, but Nitai-Gaura can be worshiped. If devotees do not stay in the center that means your preaching is not very strong. Regarding offering spinach, just it should be very clean---everything should be done very cleanly. Regarding the name of your farm, __Murari__ is a name of Krishna, so Murari Sevak means servant of Krishna.

The public should be convinced of this point: that there is life after death, and then prepare for the next life. Otherwise what is the difference between men and animals? If a man has to go outside his home, he has to make so many preparations, but an animal will not---that is the difference between a man and an animal.

Our ultimate aim is to take part in politics, because Krishna took part in politics, we have to follow---but if people do not become Krishna conscious it won't be possible. Actually if we can take up the government, our movement will be very easily spread and beneficial to the people. We can make happy, peaceful men, God conscious---this is our aim. The main thing is to distribute books more and more. That remark by the man in Houston is to your credit, that this movement is becoming an epidemic. Actually, everywhere envious people are against this movement, especially communists, because this movement is a threat to them. The main thing is to distribute books---the communist idea is spread practically all over the world on account of distributing huge amounts of literature, but they have no substance. Introduce Rathayatra very nicely and distribute books. Yes, you are welcome to join me. I wanted that besides my permanent secretary that one of the GBC's may accompany me regularly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
