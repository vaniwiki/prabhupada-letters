My dear Sivani devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 18th, 1975 and have noted the contents. To take shelter of the Spiritual Master means to follow his instructions. So, you should be very careful to not deviate even a little bit from the order of your Guru. You should be very careful to chant 16 rounds daily and read all of the books carefully. You should attend mangala arati and classes. And you should follow the four regulative principles without deviation. If you do these simple things, you will make steady advancement in Krishna Consciousness and there will be no fall downs. Regarding your young boy, do not be sorry because he is a little mischievous. This is only natural for a young boy. It is not anything unusual. Pray to Krishna that he may become a great preacher and try yourself to train him for that by being Krishna Conscious mother.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
