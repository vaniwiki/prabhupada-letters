My dear Visvakarma,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your recommendations for initiation through Jagadisa.

Yes, I will accept these devotees as you have recommended; Jita Kandarpa das and Subuddhi dasi for second initiation and Bhakta Clem for first initiation. His new name is Kartikeya dasa. Hold a fire sacrifice. Instruct Kartikeya to always follow very strictly the four regulative principles and chant a minimum of 16 rounds daily avoiding the ten offenses. The second initiates should hear the tape of me chanting Gayatri in their right ear. Instruct them how to chant on their finger divisions. Kirtanananda may chant on the beads of the new initiate.

No, you may not serve decaffinated coffee in the restaurant.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
