My dear Gurukula devotees,

Please accept my blessings. I have requested that Dayananda go to take complete charge of Gurukula, so you all please cooperate with him. I do not wish that the Gurukula should be closed. Please work combinedly and endeavour with great determination to keep it going on nicely.

Thank you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
