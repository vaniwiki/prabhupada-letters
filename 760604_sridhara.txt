My dear Sridhara Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 25, 1976, and I have noted the contents carefully.

I was very pleased to note that you are willing to go to China as we have just printed a Chinese Bhagavad-gita. I am most eager to see this distributed throughout Southeast Asia to as many Chinese speaking people as possible. For this reason I am sending Trivikrama Maharaja to Hong Kong immediately, and he will be followed by two of the big book distributers on the Radha-Damodara TSKP, being sent by Tamala Krsna Goswami. I wish that you will meet Trivikrama Swami in Hong Kong and combinedly organize distribution of the Chinese Gita profusely. It will be a great triumph. After all, one third of the world is Chinese speaking, and they are also human, they have a very old culture, so why shouldn't they be benefited by Lord Caitanya's movement.

You can go dressed as gentleman because it will be easier to travel in this part of the world. I have given full instructions to Trivikrama Maharaja and the both of you can cooperate in this very important mission.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
