My dear Makhanlal and Tilaka Devi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated 30th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. Also I have received the check for $80. as daksina from Tilaka Devi Dasi and I thank you very much for the same. It is interesting to note that her father is consulate general for Madras. He can help us if he gives an introductory letter in favor of Madhudvisa Swami to see the ambassador in Delhi. We want this ambassador should take part in the big function we are going to hold in Mayapur. So far Mr. Dhawan is concerned, I am enclosing herewith one letter in the name of Brahmananda Swami in regards to opening a center in Nigeria.*

I am so glad to hear that Von Prabhu is executing such valuable service to Krishna. Please give him my blessings. So he is giving such nice service; that is his qualification. So if you feel that he is ready, then he may take initiation by mail and we can give him a certificate also and that will save him from the draft.

Your proposal for a grhastha travelling Sankirtana party is a very good one but the temple work should not be neglected. Both things should go on simultaneously. Our process is to work on Bhagavata and Pancaratriki systems simultaneously. Deity worship is pancaratriki system and preaching is Bhagavata system. If we keep both systems in a regular way that will help us solidly in our advancement in Krishna Consciousness.

So far my health is concerned, there was a slight indication of a heart attack but it was not very acute. Krishna saved me. I have had many times such slight heart attacks since 1970 but it does not hamper my activities in Krishna Consciousness. So long as Krishna will keep me fit I will go on working. So you devotees should pray to Krishna that I can go on giving Him service up to the last point of my death.

Supersoul is sitting in everyone's heart, so when He hears the effect of hearing is there. So it is to be understood that the Spiritual Master is also hearing.

Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Brahmananda Swami has written Mr. Dhawan asking for six round-trip tickets from Kenya for going there to establish a center.\\
