My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of the October issue of __Brijbasi Spirit.__

It is very nice. I have read with great pleasure the article about the construction of my palace. When is it going to be finished? When it is finished I will be anxious to come there to stay.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
