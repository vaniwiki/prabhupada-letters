My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter dated March 12, 1968. I thank you very much for it, and I am so glad to hear that everything is going well there, and that Yadunandana and John are there helping in so many ways.

So far the picture is concerned, Gurudasa has recently taken some very nice photographs, and I shall ask him to send some copies to you. Yes, to make posters as you suggest will be very nice, please do it.

Please continue to help all the young girls, both in N.Y., and S.F. as well. If they take to following your example of sincere service, they will all be advanced in Krishna Consciousness very rapidly. Your example is very nice, using your artistic abilities to serve Krishna, and they may all follow in your footsteps. I think there is no need for coming to S.F., as most of the girls are there, and recently Anapurna dasi has left for Boston, also. She is very nice young girl, and with artistic abilities, so you please help her as she arrives there.

Yes, there are two Boar Incarnations; one is reddish, and the other whitish. Varaha is the first, He is reddish just like a boar.

The dishwashing occupation is open to anyone who wishes to help. There is no restriction. Also, non-initiates may help in cooking prasadam under the direction of devotees. That is all right.

Please keep me informed of the progress of your fine arts department; I am always anxious to hear how they are doing very nicely. Hope you are well, and I hope Pradyumna is being well taken care of, and will be feeling better soon.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
