My dear Balavanta das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 9, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding the initiations, I am pleased to inform you that I have initiated them as follows:

Mike Munoz---Mahejya das

Linda Hynes---Naradi devi dasi

Doreen Mercado---Dhara devi dasi

So you can have their beads chanted upon by Kirtanananda Swami. My only request is that you see to it that all our men are strictly following the rules and regulations as I have given. I am only concerned for your spiritual life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
