My dear Vrindaban Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28th August, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am very much anxious to know about your wife. I hope that she is doing well after that accident. Please offer her my blessings.

Regarding your returning to college, I have sent the case to Karandhara Prabhu and he will decide on the matter locally.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
