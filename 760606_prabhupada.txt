My dear Prabhupada dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 31, 1976, and I have noted the contents carefully.

Concerning the production of toothpaste and cosmetics for which I may be able to supply the information, etc., you can come to see me in Toronto when I visit there between the 16th of June until the 21st of June.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
