My dear Aksayananda Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 8th January, 1976.

Why Saurabha should be consulted for Temple functioning and maintenance? He cannot give you any idea for these things. He is busy with other matters.

Dramas are alright if you can perform them nicely. Even if you don't speak them in English, they can be rendered into Hindi on the microphone while the drama goes on. But the puppet shows should be stopped. It is nonsense.

What are those Bengali dramas that Nitai is working on? He should work on arcana-paddhati, not divert his attention here and there. He should make Hari-bhakti-Vilasa into short cut, not more than twenty pages. He can consult Nrsimha Vallabha Goswami for help in this matter. This should be his first consideration now.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Please let me know how "mukut" department is going to be managed? Who is the manager and what is the management scheme?\\
