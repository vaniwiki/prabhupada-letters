My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated Wednesday, 6th September, 1972, and I am very glad to hear that you and your good wife want to go to Perth, Australia, for opening one ISKCON center. There is no doubt about it that I shall sanction your endeavor in this respect. I am always praying that my disciples will gradually increase our war against __maya__ on all fronts. But I do not think it is necessary to take money from Karandhara for opening that center. From our experience we have found it is always in the long run more stable and better situation if local people can be persuaded to help from the very beginning. So you may solicit money from them in small amounts and gradually collect in that way enough to open a center in involve or engage all of the local people from the very beginning. You are the pioneer in Australia so I shall expect the Perth center to be first class in every way, and next year when I return from India I have been invited to Djakarta and New Zealand so I shall be very glad to stop at Perth, Australia, also and see you then.

Hoping this meets you and your good wife Citralekha Dasi in the best of health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
