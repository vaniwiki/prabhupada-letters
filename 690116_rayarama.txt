My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of January 10, 1969, and I have noted the contents with care. I am so glad to hear that you were enjoying your visit in Los Angeles last week, and you should know that I was similarly very glad to have you here with me. As you are sick with the flu now, I think it best that you do not exert yourself by working too much strenuously but rather you rest as much as possible until you are feeling better.

I have noted with pleasure that Jaya Govinda* has sent you a nice Govardhana Hill article for printing in __Back To Godhead.__ I have already instructed Jaya Govinda to arrange for going to Hamburg and let us see what will happen with this boy. I have been requested by Janardana in Montreal temple to immediately send him the original manuscript of __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ and I think that you are keeping this manuscript in New York so kindly send it to Montreal as soon as possible. Janardana will require this manuscript to translate into the French language for publication, so it is important business, and please do the needful in this connection.

Thanking you once more for your letter. I hope this finds you improving in your health.

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

* I have received one letter from Jaya Govinda which suggests that he and Acyutananda are being poisoned like Hrsikesa. Will you send me the last letter of Jaya Govinda which you have said is not very good. Will you send it to me? ACB
