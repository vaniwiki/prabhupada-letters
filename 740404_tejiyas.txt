Dear Tejyas,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of March 27th with check book and statement.

In your footnote you have given discouraging information about the land in Kalkaji. The best thing is if you three, Saurabha, Gurudasa and yourself jointly inspect the land and see if you can utilize it for our purpose. We can use any land, but if you think it will be very, very difficult then what is the use of accepting it.

You say I will have to go in person to the registrar office, but that is not a problem. In Hyderabad they gave me land and a Power of Attorney was given to Mahamsa Swami and he took delivery.

So the three of you inspect and give a joint report. If it is useless then don't bother. For the time being we are paying Rs 2,500 monthly and no sufficient water and the neighborhood is opposing. In consideration of this, I wanted the Kalkaji land, which is developing equal to Connaught Circus.

Kindly send me an exact site plan. The road and access plan may be hand-drawn, it doesn't matter, showing the length and breadth, the surrounding neighborhood etc. The point is, we are not going to make any big scheme anywhere else unless we have sufficient manpower. At present we have to import men from foreign countries and manage in that way. It is not possible to accept any big scheme in New Delhi. Therefore if we could get even small land just to keep our office, for the purpose I thought the land was nice.

Visit, and if you all think even for that purpose it is no good then give up the idea; what can be done? But at Kalkaji there is a big Anandamayi asrama and surrounding colonies are inhabited by Bengalis. Anyway, you see and examine further and send me a report with site plan and we shall finally decide.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
