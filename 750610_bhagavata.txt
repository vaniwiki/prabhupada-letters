My dear Bhagavata dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 28, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to hear that things are going on very nicely there. Keep on working with this nice enthusiasm and carefully observing all the rules and regulations, chanting, reading,---in this way, you will always be a success. Regarding Nandulala, Gurukrpa Maharaja wanted her to go to Japan and collect for some time there and then afterwards, if she likes, she may come again to Calcutta.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
