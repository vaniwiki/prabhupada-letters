My dear Dinesh Babu,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 24th June 1976 and have noted the contents with care. I am now staying at Delhi at the above address. From here I shall go to Vrndavana. I am also not keeping good health.

In New York I caught a cold and it continued for about one month of coughing at night without any sleep. But still I am travelling. I went from New York to London to Paris to Tehran to Bombay to Hyderabad to here.

So I am sorry to learn that you are not well. Pray to Krishna and chant Hare Krishna. The body is a temple of disease, __janma mrtyu jara vyadhi__ [[books:bg:13:8-12|(Bg. 13.9)]]. Disease is our inevitable companion. We still have to execute our duty of Krishna consciousness as far as possible and Krishna will help us. We are going to have a very big project at Mayapur. We have to acquire 350 acres of land from the Government and construct a spiritual town at the expense of Rs. 200 Crores. The plans and contemplations are going on in different phases, now when Caitanya Mahaprabhu will be pleased it will be taken up.

After Vrndavana, I may return to Mayapur by the month of December and I hope by that time you will be quite fit to come and meet me. Thank you very much for your enquiry.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
