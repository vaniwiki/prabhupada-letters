My dear Sankarasan,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 2nd September, 1971 and have noted the contents. Also I have received the three checks enclosed for $15.00, $12.50 and $10.76 respectively and I thank you very much for the same. Also I have seen the clipping of Visnujana Maharaja speaking with the mayor. It appears that he is doing very nicely there, preaching in Austin. Please offer him my blessings.

I can see also that you are a very sincere and enthusiastic boy and are anxious for spreading this movement. Those are first class qualifications for making advancement in Krishna Consciousness. So continue enthusiastically as you are doing and Krishna will surely bless you. Follow the regulative principles strictly, chant your 16 rounds faithfully, study our literatures, go for street Sankirtana, etc. All these activities will make you fixed up in Krishna's service and eligible for going back to home, back to Godhead.

You can tell Bill and Hayden to send me some photographs just as soon as the Deities have been carved.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
