My dear Caturbhuja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 8, 1972, and I have well appreciated your sentiments. Your father has indicated to me that he shall be returning to London very shortly, so I have encouraged him to meet me there when I shall arrive there by July 5th. So you may be assured, and your mother may be assured, that your father will be returning to your home in London very shortly. I am very glad to hear that Krishna has protected you from the physical injury to your left eye. Just like Prahlada Maharaja always remembered Krishna and that saved Him from the most difficult situations. If we constantly remember to take shelter only at Krishna's Lotus Feet, then we shall always be saved from all sorts of dangers.

I shall be meeting you and your good family in London. Meanwhile, hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever will-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
