My dear Lalita Priya devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 10th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am happy to know that you are feeling blissful in our Krishna Consciousness movement. We should follow in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya and the six Goswamis of Vrndavana. They were always serving Krishna in the mood of separation. They never said that "now I have seen Krishna" or "last night I danced with Krishna"---No. They were crying where is Krishna, and they were always searching after Him, wondering when they would finally be able to see Him. We should also desire intensely to see and be with Krishna, but first thing is to become purified through devotional service. It is not possible otherwise. So, keep on helping me to spread this Krishna Consciousness movement, following the rules and regulations very carefully, and your life will be perfected and you will see Krishna.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
