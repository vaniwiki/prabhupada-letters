My dear Sri Govinda Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5th August, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. It is so much encouraging to note how nicely you are distributing BTG. That is our main business, to distribute our literatures. This incense business is all right as a supplement, but we should give all our energy to distribute these literatures and magazines. Then we maintain ourselves and at the same time push on this Krishna Consciousness philosophy.

Your idea for a festival much like the one we held in Calcutta and Bombay, at all the university campuses is a very good proposal, so do it nicely. Simply pictures of Guru Gauranga will do; there is no need of taking along Jagannatha Deities. And so far getting Jagannatha Deities from Jayapataka Swami, why you are making that extra expenditure? All our Jagannatha Deities are locally carved. Any boy who knows carving can carve Jagannatha. If you want you can order Gaura Nitai Deities; that is all right.

So far brahminical rules for cleanliness, those I have already described in the letter mentioned by you. Brahminical means cleanliness. We are trying to create a brahminical society. So all the devotees under your care there in Cleveland should be trained up in that light. Cleanliness is next to Godliness.

Please offer my blessings to the other boys and girls there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
