Bombay

My dear Visakha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Bombay dated May 24, 1972, along with the very nice article, __Prabhupada: India's National Hero.__ I am very grateful to you for your kind words about me, but I do not think that I have done anything, but I am only delivering the best message as it is. Actually, anyone who is a sincere devotee of Krishna and who is rendering service by preaching His message is to be considered as hero. So you are all heroes of your country and your humanity. Hero means someone who others want to follow as example of the best type of person. So you all become like that, perfect examples of Krishna Consciousness heroes and heroines, and preach the message exactly as I have taught it to you very seriously and being fully convinced, and others will automatically come forward and join us. We shall all be like one great army of heroes for Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

I am very glad to hear that you are using your talents very nicely to do artwork and photographic designs to make brochures. It is very important to have such brochures for presenting to important men of the Indian society, so make them very elegantly and just to the points of interest.

I have met with your good husband's parents in Los Angeles and they are both very nice and they respect me also.

Hoping this will find you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
