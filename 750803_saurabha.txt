Bombay

My dear Saurabha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 25, 1975 with enclosed sketch and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the land offered by Bon Maharaja, if it cannot be in our name then we shall not take it. Why he cannot lease the land, or sell it to us? He wrote me that I can develop the Gurukula "as I desire," but who will possess the land? I am prepared to cooperate with him, but if our money is there, then also our management must be there. What does it mean that he would like to come with me for preaching? Does he want to travel with me?

Regarding the east side adjacent land, why don't you purchase it? The price has already been settled at Rs. 20/- per sq. yard. You should immediately purchase. The money is there in the bank, so go to the bank. Why there so much delay? So many men are there, Gopala Krishna, Pranava, etc. What is Pranava doing? The M-V Trust will pay, so do not worry about Vishvambar. What is his family business? Anyway, purchase the land first, then we shall see about the scheme. If there is some difficulty about investigation of the sellers properties, then go together to the D.M. and arrange for the seller not to be investigated if possible. You are all simply writing letters to me. Without my personal presence there you cannot do anything. Simply correspondence. Anyway, be careful there is no underhanded dealings in this transaction. It is very much risky, so be careful.

Regarding Bombay, yes the tenants have no right for recreation area. They are paying for the rooms at much less price, so they can remain in their rooms. They cannot have playing ground. This is not in the Rent Act. We cannot spare any land. We will construct land on all available space. They can go to the public park for playing. All vacant land should be developed with buildings. We want sufficient income.

Yes, please send me regular report of the Bombay construction. I am very much anxious and will be glad to receive your regular reports.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
