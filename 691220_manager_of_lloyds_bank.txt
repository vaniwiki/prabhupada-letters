Dear Sir,

With further reference to your letter JC/RB, dated November 24, 1969, and my reply dated November 27, 1969, I beg to inform you that I am leaving London tomorrow. Therefore I authorize Mr. Michael Grant to take delivery of the parcels due to arrive here, and the passbook is left here with him. You can debit the charges to my account.

Sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
