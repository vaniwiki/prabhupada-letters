My dear Gargamuni Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 2, 1974 with enclosed copy of Trial Balance from June '73 to June '74. and also your telegram reading as follows: ONE THOUSAND RUPEES BOOKS SOLD MAYAPUR RAS PURNIMA DAY THOUSAND VISITED CHANDRADOYA MANDIR PRASADAM DISTRIBUTED---\\
GARGAMUNI SWAMI.

So this is very nice. Why not reprint our __Gitar Gan__ in Japan fifty thousand copies? Our temple is getting more and more famous. It is already famous as the sahib temple. And it will become even more famous when there is gate. %%__%% walls, kitchen, prasadam pavilion, and lake. Then it will be very nice. So I am looking forward to seeing these things when I return to Mayapur. This next Sunday I am planning to start for Honolulu.

Please send the monthly trial balances.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
