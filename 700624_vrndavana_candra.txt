My dear Vrndavana Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th June, 1970. You are doing very nicely. Krsna is giving you intelligence. So remain dependent on Krsna and work sincerely and everything will come out very easily.

The program of work given by you is very satisfactory. And it is good that you have got an opportunity to teach a course in the John Hopkins Free University. I have seen the photograph and the cutting from the university catalog. They are very encouraging. I am glad that Subala also came to assist you.

So accepting always Krsna as the Supreme advisor and always begging for his mercy, go on with your progressive march---and I am very satisfied with your activities. I am so glad to learn that your good wife is also helping you. That is the duty of a faithful companion of life. If the wife is helpful in the spiritual progress of life, she is the best friend and philosopher. So in Krsna Consciousness the wife is never a burden, but she is completely a counterpart. So set example to your countrymen how younger generation can live peacefully, husband and wife, being engaged in Krsna's service. There are many examples of this type of husband and wife working in our different centers for propagating this sublime message.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
