My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated June 23, 1969, on which date I have reached here at Los Angeles. Regarding Glen's contribution of $2,000, I may request you to send it to me by return of post. The house contemplated, I don't think is suitable for our purpose. In your country, a house at $19,000, especially in a city like Boston, must not be very large and accommodating. The best thing is to rent a big house if you cannot purchase a big one. But in all cases, I shall prefer a big house which can accommodate our temple and residence quarters. If possible, the book-binding department will be included also. If you purchase a small house, then again you will have to rent some other house for other purposes.

Regarding Madan Mohan, I have already written to him, and I am also writing again separately along with this letter that if he finds Boston a suitable place for himself, then I have no objection that he remains there. But he must continue the work of indexing very nicely the original __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ As soon as this indexing is finished, I shall publish another revised and enlarged edition of __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ at my own cost. I was not happy to publish it through MacMillan as they have crippled the explanations for so many important verses.

Regarding Jadurani, I am happy that she has returned to Boston again. Now let her join with the Sankirtana Party and I am sure she will improve her health more and more. For the time being, she may not revive her painting work until she gets back more strength. Regarding your Sankirtana Party activities, please continue this most important function. The nice pictures you have sent have been dispatched to Brahmananda for publishing in __Back To Godhead.__ I have given instructions that in __Back To Godhead__ the pictures of our activities and short descriptions should be more and more published. So continue to send such pictures as you have already sent.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
