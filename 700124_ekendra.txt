My dear Ekendra das Brahmacari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your good handwriting letter, and I am so pleased to learn that you are joining the Sankirtana Party along with Birbhadra and Girish.

I shall always pray to Krishna for your spiritual progress and good health hundreds of times, and you be happy under the protection of New Vrndavana.

I am so pleased to learn that you are studying arithmetic so quickly. Five plus five is equal to ten. Two plus two is equal to four. So Krishna plus everything is Vrndavana. Do not forget Krishna, and you shall always be in Vrndavana.

Thank you very much.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
