My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated June 18, 1968, and I am so glad to note the contents. I think Krishna is giving you the required intelligence how to spread our transcendental movement. This is the right way, as you have adopted. To chant Hare Krishna, very nicely, with musical instruments and mrdanga, speak the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita, and sell our literatures like books and magazines. That process will make our mission successful. Please try to do it very nicely.

Regarding the bus, the best thing will be to dispose of and get some money. One thing, you must be very careful that we should not divert our attention for money making too much. If we can make money by the process which you have now adopted, that is very nice. But we cannot divert our attention to such things as running on the bus, etc. This is not good. The bus should be sold to get out of the botheration. If the bus was in good condition, we could have it to utilized to move ourselves, but that is not possible. Under the circumstances, better that you dispose of it at highest possible price and get out of the complication.

Yes, that is all right, Himavati can sew nice things for selling. And your advice for the boys in San Francisco is very nice. They can also go out everyday into the Golden Gate Park and hold kirtana and so many people will come.

Yes, Vamanadeva can stay as your assistant, and can come here when you come. There is no objection.

Money making schemes should be easy; we cannot divert our attention for money making activities. We require some money for prosecuting our activities, and if we get that money by contribution that is best, otherwise, we can sell our literature and books, etc. But if we direct our attention like others, then it becomes karma. And karma is very dangerous for persons who want to go back to Godhead. Therefore, in Bhagavad-gita karma yoga is advised. On the whole, we can endeavor for money making if it doesn't hamper our devotional service. And otherwise, we shall prefer to starve and chant Hare Krishna. That should be the pivot of all our activities.

Hoping you are both well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
