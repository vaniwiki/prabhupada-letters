My dear Wendy Weiser,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your nice letter of August 4, 1968, and I thank you very much for it. Yes, this is a very nice proposal. It is very good that you would like to go to Boston to the Brahmacarini asrama under Jadurani's care. Please go there as soon as it is convenient for you, and Jadurani will be very pleased to receive you there, along with the other Brahmacarinis.

And when you are in Boston, it is not very far from Montreal, so you can come here to visit. And when you come here, we shall talk together, and I shall initiate you as my disciple if you so desire. And I shall be very pleased to meet with you and also Saradia, if she also comes here.

Hoping you are all well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
