My dear Advaita,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 30th June, 1971, along with second canto book, chapters VII & VIII. It was very nicely done and the cover is very attractive, but one thing is that my picture has come out very black. There are so many pictures, and if that one was so black, you should not have chosen it. But other than that it was very nice.

You will be very glad to know that very soon, within a fortnight, I will be coming to N.Y., and to visit the press also. Please offer my blessings to the others. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
