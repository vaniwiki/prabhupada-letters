New Vrndavana

My dear Sriman Kenneth,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter Dated 23rd August, 1970, expressing your humble realizations concerning Krsna Consciousness process.

Yes, it is the only way that one can approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Lord Krsna's instructions to Arjuna in the Bhagavad-gita, this science is passed down perfectly only via the bona fide line of disciplic succession. So one has got to find out some representative of the Lord who is in the bona fide disciplic succession and then follow the Lord's instructions that after finding out such a Spiritual Master one should try to learn the truth from him by inquiring submissively and rendering service unto him. This method of approaching Krsna must be accepted because it is offered by the Lord Himself.

So the first step is that one should consider carefully whether here is a bona fide Spiritual Master to whom I can surrender myself without any hesitation.

I am very glad that you have decided to rejoin our spiritual community of Krsna Consciousness at New Vrndavana. We have established New Vrndavana to be developed as a model of Krsna Consciousness or pure, unadulterated spiritual community practical for all persons. Actually the atmosphere there is very transcendental and I am very pleased that you have got the good sense to take advantage of this shelter from the distress and frustration of the material world.

Please try your best to learn our Krsna philosophy very nicely, when you have some difficult point you can ask advice from Sriman Hayagriva or your elder Godbrothers. Chant Hare Krsna always, do your regular tasks in Krsna Consciousness, cooperate with the other devotees, follow strictly the four regulative principles and be happy in the service of the Lord.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
