====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

Dear Tamala Krishna Maharaja

Please accept my blessings. I have left India on April 1, 1973 so now it is almost 20 days and I have received no report from India. There are so many questions and answers for India, the Bombay, and Hyderabad, but I am in darkness.

Giriraja is silent on the Chagganlal case, and what about the deed for Hyderabad, and whether Mayapur building is completed. This time when I return to India I want to see Mayapur completed.

What is the Bhopal preaching report?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
