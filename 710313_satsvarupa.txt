My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated 21st and 23rd February, 1971, respectively. I have also received the newspaper clipping showing Hrdayananda's wedding and it is very nice. So far as him taking over the management of Boston temple, that is all right. All department heads should train an assistant so that in their absence, work may not suffer but go on continuously. However, why do you want to divorce yourself entirely from management of Boston temple? Do you think that is necessary?

Our new publication "The Modern Mission of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness" sounds very nice and you may send me some copies as soon as they are printed up. So far as your suggestion for a booklet of operational principles, you may go ahead as planned. For this book so many points have been explained in the Nectar of Devotion. So why don't you refer to it? Last year's handbook was not bad. There was sufficient stock of information there but if you can improve upon it still further, that will be very nice. Also very soon I shall send you one complete set of instructions on worshiping the Deity and you can print in English and distribute. This book shall be named "Method of Worship".

So far as life membership is concerned, what is this time and circumstance of U.S.A.? To become a life member means a person has become sympathetic. They should simply be convinced of the importance of our movement, and that according to your activity. In some newspaper clippings I have read, about our devotees. "These are good men and we want more men like this in our community." That is certainly good impression. They are sympathetic and so for them to become our life member is not difficult. There are four divisions of members; life member, donor member, subscriber member, and common member. So any membership will make the people sympathetic to our movement and it will be a stride toward our progressive march.

Yes, it is my desire that Isana and his wife and child stay there in Boston temple and Isana may continue as cook there. He should always be kept engaged. He is a bit crazy but he is a very good soul. Please give him my blessings and let me know how he is doing there.

So far as helping youth cases, they should live with us. We cannot devote separate time for them. That is not possible. If anyone desires to be treated, he must live with us. Before admitting him, we must see that he is not a mad man and will not create a disturbance. If he lives with us and sees how
