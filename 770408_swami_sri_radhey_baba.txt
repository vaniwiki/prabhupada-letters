My dear Radhey Baba,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 4th April, 1977 along with the enclosed essay entitled "Back."

The essay is very good and I thank you for it. You have very nicely understood and described the meaning of "Back to Godhead." I am sending your article to the editor of our Back to Godhead Magazine in Los Angeles, Sri Satsvarupa Goswami, for publication.

Hoping this meets you well.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
