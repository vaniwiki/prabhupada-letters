My dear Cyavana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of 24 June which has just been forwarded to me here in Australia.

I am relieved to know your whereabouts again after not hearing from you for some time. You want to see me and I also have some important things to discuss with you, so the best thing is if we meet at the end of July in Vrindaban, India. Today I am leaving for the United States to attend Rathayatra in Chicago and San Francisco but at the end of July I will reach Vrindaban. We are having a very big festival there on Janmastami when we will open our Krsna Balarama temple by installing the deities. So you must also attend to help in conducting the ceremonies. I will therefore see you in Vrindaban by the end of July. If you wish to correspond with me before then you can write to the Los Angeles address.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
