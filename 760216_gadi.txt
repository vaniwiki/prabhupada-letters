My dear Gadi das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 27, 1976.

Regarding your questions; Arjuna, Yudhisthira Maharaja, and Draupadi were not killed in the battle. They are always personal associates of Krishna. Wherever Krishna goes, they go. The Bhagavad-gita says: bahuni me vyatitani janmani tava carjuna. "Both you and I have passed many lives; I remember, but you do not."

And at the time of death somehow or other Krishna takes special care. He says: aham tva sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami.

Regarding distribution of my books, somebody may say something, but that doesn't matter. Somehow or other they are taking our Krishna book. However it should be done so there is not legal implication. And aggressiveness is not good. That should be checked.

So you may hold a fire sacrifice and Hiowana Nivens (Hatari das) should vow to chant minimum 16 rounds and keep strictly the four regulative principles. Paramatma das may hear the mantra in the right ear. He should keep clean internally by chanting Hare Krishna mantra always and externally by bathing regularly. You yourself must set the example. Satsvarupa Maharaja can chant on the beads and you can find enclosed brahmana thread duly chanted on by me.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
