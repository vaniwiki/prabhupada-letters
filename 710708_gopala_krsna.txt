====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

Brooklyn

My dear Gopala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 3d July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I have not heard from you since a very long time. When I was in India, I met your father several times and your mother also. They used to come by the temple in Bombay. Your father is pleased that you are working here. Your mother is anxious to see you. I have assured her that her son would come when needed. They are happy.

I have received your check for $60.00 as well as the very nice ball point pen. Thank you very much.

I am also glad to hear that you are improving your position. So do your duty nicely, taking it as Krishna's mercy, and try to serve Krishna as far as possible. Live peacefully with your wife also. She is very nice girl. Please offer her my blessings. And if you like, and you think it is possible, then surely you can open a center in Connecticut State. So do it together, husband and wife, and organize it nicely.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
