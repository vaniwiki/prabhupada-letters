Phoenix

My dear Nalinikanta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated January 12th, 1976.

I accept Mr. and Mrs. Kelley as my disciples. Their spiritual names are Sarvasiddhirat das and Svayamprabha dasi. Now you must hold a fire ceremony and they should vow to always chant minimum of sixteen round daily and strictly to adhere to the regulative principles.

Regarding Phoenix Temple, this should be discussed at the forthcoming GBC meeting. I want that in every village and town there may be Temple. But how far this is possible now, that has to be discussed.

I am glad that you are bringing 10 devotees to Mayapur for the festival. We are constructing 67 rooms more and we hope they will be ready when all the devotees come.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
