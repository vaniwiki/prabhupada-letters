My dear Durgesh,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 10/6/75 and have noted the contents. Please keep yourself saved by chanting 16 rounds daily and following the regulative principles, and reading books. For the time being, stay with your parents until you are of proper age to be independent. Raghunatha dasa Goswami was also restricted by his parents, but ultimately he joined Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's movement and became one of the six Goswamis of Vrndavana. So, do not be discouraged, rather feel fortunate that at such a young age you are able to practice Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
