My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your two letters dated January 30 and February 13, 1976 respectively.

Regarding the examination, I never meant that the examination would be held this year. It will be held first next year. The examination is meant for the intelligent class, not all. Neither it is compulsory. So to pass the examination means one must have knowledge. There are higher intelligent class of disciples, otherwise it is not compulsory. So how to organize it, how to do it, you GBC can decide. I have given the idea, now how to do it is up to the GBC.

Regarding the purchase of the Washington temple, that is all right if it is certain that all the monies paid out will be applied toward the cost price. Better purchase than rent. And I think that Brisakapi should follow the example of Rupa Goswami. Rupa Goswami took sannyasa and gave 50% in charity, 25% for family use, and he kept 25% for emergency. Krishna wants to see that the life is sacrificed, but also accumulation, money, should be given to Krishna. Life to Krishna and money to wife is not a good decision.

Thank you for getting this chaplaincy. Now it should be done nicely and started in other places. It will be very nice if we can get it in every school.

It is nice they are maintaining and increasing the Rathayatra program in Philadelphia. Last year's program was very nice. That is good they have sold the jewelry business; we have got so nice book business, why shall we have this? You say Atlanta has pledged $33,000, that is nice, whose business can give us profit like that?

Yes, this supplying of milk to the temple is wanted. Thank you. In the way that Atlanta is doing, every center must have a farm so we can get all milk and if possible vegetable, even fruit, flowers and milk.

They are getting a flat-bed truck, then no blocking. They can sit comfortably and chant and people will hear. He (Madhava das) is giving a class at MIT, that is very good. I challenged them where is the technology to understand the distinction between a dead man and a live man.

Regarding relocating New Kuruksetra and beginning the Bhaktivedanta Institute there, first of all decide among the scientists, Svarupa Damodara and party, and if they agree then I have no objection.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
