My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 24th March, 1970, and it is very encouraging.

When Brahmananda came here, I discussed with him that we have now opened so many branches and they should be properly maintained. As I am personally here in Los Angeles, and because Krsna has now given us a very nice church, it will be possible for me to look after the business here to be the ideal for other centers. The church building is very excellent. I am sending herewith two pictures. We have already paid the advance money, $50,000, out of $225,000. Your contribution is very much welcome.

I was to advance $20,000 as loan from my book fund, but Gargamuni has arranged not to take from me more than $11,500. So whatever contribution is received from other centers will go for repaying the loan taken from me and from other centers.

Regarding moving with Sankirtana Party, as Kirtanananda Maharaja is doing now, it will be another impetus for pushing forward our mission. Please do this business very nicely. Caitanya Mahaprabhu also did like that and He presented Himself as a merchant in Krsna Consciousness selling the transcendental commodity in exchange of eagerness of the people. If people simply become faithful to the understanding of Krsna Consciousness, that will be the price for our transcendental commodity, Hare Krsna Mantra.

As you are having many engagements, it is very much encouraging. The clippings which you have sent are very nice. You are going to about a dozen colleges in different places and that is very much encouraging also.

I have all my blessings for Jagajjanani Dasi and Prahladananda Das for being married under your care. Train this couple for opening a new branch in one of the places you are now visiting with Sankirtana Party. Try to open as many branches as possible and manage to see them that they are going on nicely. That is my request.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife and all the Prabhus there in Buffalo Temple. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
