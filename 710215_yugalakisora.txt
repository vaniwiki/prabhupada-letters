My dear Sriman Yugalakisora Das Brahmacari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your repentant letter dated 28th January, 1971, and I am so much glad that you have again come to our camp after some time being mislead by Maya. You should take severe warning from this incident and not treat the matter as very light. Maya is always peeping for a chance to allure the neophyte devotees from the path of Krsna Consciousness and this potential danger is always there everywhere in the material world. The only solution to the danger of material entanglement and consequent unhappiness is to surrender unconditionally at the Lotus feet of Krsna because only He can give assurance of protection from all sinful reactions. So you are very much fortunate that Krsna has again taken you back into the company of devotees.

I am glad to accept you as my initiated disciple and your spiritual name is Yugalakisora Das Brahmacari. The transcendental young couple of Radha and Krsna are known as Yugal Kisora. Please strictly follow the regulative principles of no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication. Chant Hare Krsna Mahamantra daily at least sixteen rounds and be happy in devotional service to the Lord. If you have any difficulties of doubt or question, you may put them to your elder Godbrothers or if need be to me. I shall be glad to help you advance in Krsna's service as far as possible. Try to learn the philosophy thoughtfully and teach others how to understand this transcendental science for the benefit of all.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
