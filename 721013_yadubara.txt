My dear Yadubara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 30, 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. Concerning your request for money for Hindi and Gujarati BTG's where is the money collected from the first editions. For any magazine published money should be collected and then republished. Accounts should be kept---money invested money collected. What is this that every time money is invested, then for a reprinting, more money has to be invested?

In my last letter I informed you that 70,000 and 29,000 rupees were transferred from the Book Fund, whether this money has been returned to Book Fund. So there is no information in your letter about this, so let me know in Vrndavana whether this fund has been returned yet. Mahamsa knows it, Giriraja knows it and you as secretary should also have known it. So when I return you should inform me and then I shall do the needful.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
