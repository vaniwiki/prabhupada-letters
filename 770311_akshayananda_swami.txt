My dear Akshayananda,

Please accept my blessings. Brahmananda Swami is handing over to you one letter to be submitted to Punjab National Bank in regard to renewing a Fixed Deposit I am keeping with them. I have advised the bank to transfer the interest accrued from the matured deposit to my a/c #1. Please have this entered into my passbook.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I notice on the letterhead the road is still called Chattikara Road. Why the change has not been made yet? Also what is the position with the Gates?
