Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter from Calcutta dated August 19, 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very glad to know that the work is going on carefully under your direction and that building will the first class building in all of Nadia Province. Wherever it is possible try to save the construction costs by getting donations. But we must have that building completed at any cost. But if you can raise at least 60,000 rupees per month locally that should be given by the local men without any difficulty. I have received one letter from Madhavananda and he has assured me that the collecting is going on well. He has also mentioned that you are planning your Maidan Pandal from 7th October to November 5th tentatively. But these things must be consulted amongst all of you leaders, not that one man decides these things whimsically. My program is already sent to you earlier, I shall be in Vrndavana from middle October to middle November, but after that time I am free to come to Calcutta for holding our festival, but these things should be decided amongst all of you leaders in India, including Gurudasa, Giriraja, Tamala, Bhavananda, Gargamuni.

So far the people asking you what is the actual birth site of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, ask them to go to Tirtha Maharaja. We do not bother about these things. He is in charge of the Caitanya Math. We are foreigners and we have come here the last. There are so many other temples before us, why don't they go there for asking. They should inquire from our predecessors like Caitanya Math. This is a long controversial point, do not bother with it. We accept our predecessor's version, that's all. Navadvipa means nine islands or dvipas and the present Navadvipa city is Koladvipa.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
