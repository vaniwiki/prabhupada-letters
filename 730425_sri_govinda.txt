My dear Sri Govinda Das Adhikari:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 24, 1973 with enclosures. Your report has given me unbounded pleasure and I very much appreciate your activities. Your university program has given me much satisfaction, so you try to continue it. Yes, they must appreciate my Bhagavatam because it is nothing business but is a matter of realization.

Regarding purchasing apartment house, M-V Trust will immediately purchase and monthly rent may be paid into the Trust. Now you immediately send me scheme and description of a suitable building, and I will send Karandhara Prabhu there with the down-payment to finish the transaction.

Your paper also I like very much. It is very nicely done. But, as we have the Back to Godhead paper,* if the men can be used elsewhere in pushing on this movement there is no harm. I want that all you boys use your American intelligence cooperatively in spreading this Sankirtana movement. You are doing solid work in Chicago area and I thank you very much for assisting me in this way.

I am pleased to accept the two boys Sandipani Muni Das (Chris) and Madhavendra Puri Das (Michael) as my initiated disciples. You can send their beads with a copy of this letter to Satsvarupa Das Goswami for being chanted upon.

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest regarding the apartment house.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
