My dear Jaya Pataka,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 23 January, 1970, along with the beads of Daniel Leboef. I have duly chanted the beads sent by him and his initiated name is Dindayal.

I am glad to learn that another branch in Toronto you are contemplating to open. This news I have received from Cidananda also. Certainly it is a good news, but we must always remember that once a center is opened, it cannot be closed at any time.

I am returning back one letter from Hem Chandar Bhargava and Co. I think you sent it by mistake to me. It appears the invoice of pictures which you have imported from India. You should not be unnecessarily embarrassed on the point of Raktaka's marriage with somebody who is not initiated. Yes, I have received the deposit slip of $50, and I am enclosing herewith a separate letter to Gopala Krishna.

Regarding competition with Ramakrishna Mission and Yoga camps in Toronto, why should you be afraid of them? They are very insignificant organizations in the face of Krishna Consciousness Movement. Everyone says that what Ramakrishna Mission could not do in 80 years time, we have done many more times in three years time. So nobody can check this genuine movement of Krishna Consciousness by artificial means of bluff. Any sincere soul, serious in the matter of self-realization, will certainly be attracted by our Movement.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
