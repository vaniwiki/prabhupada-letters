My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter mailed to Germany, and I have examined the contents.

As of your writing, Govardhana Prabhu, the Detroit president had left his post and was living in the Chicago temple, because he was not chanting his sixteen rounds. I hope by now he has taken your advice and has returned to his post and is following the chanting with full knowledge. In your previous letter you stated that the deity worship in Detroit was superexcellent and that all programs were being expertly managed by govardhana. Why should he leave therefore? You write he is chanting 14 rounds daily; so you are experienced and know what to do in this case, simply encourage him to chant 16 rounds. The injunction is kirtaniya sada hari, one should always be chanting all day. The 16 rounds is just a minimum I set for my disciples so they will chant at least that much. Actually chanting should always be going on. So I will be anxious to hear that Govardhana has returned and is chanting more seriously, aware that he must do so to remain free from the clutches of maya.

Regarding the techniques for book distribution, it is all right if the devotees dress like the young people they are selling the books to. The main thing is that the innocent are given the books and the chance to become Krsna Conscious by reading them. You have to see that our book distributers are also reading my books and following all the regulative principles, then it is all right selling in public in that way.

So I shall expect to see you in Chicago on July 5 for the Rathayatra and we can discuss more.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
