My dear Syamasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Sept. 13, 1970, and I have noted the contents carefully and with pleasure. I am especially pleased to note your fresh enthusiasm after your recent visit to the States, and also your statement that there is renewed determination and fresh enthusiasm in all of the temples you have visited. That is very encouraging to me, and if the GBC continues to work in this way there will be no difficulty in the future.

Your proposals for increasing our popularity and familiarity among influential circles in the U.S. is very good. You may know that when I was in L.A. I especially wanted to use the new temple to attract some influential persons to our movement, but nothing much was done in that regard. Now if you can do something, that is more important than coming to India immediately. Lord Krishna says in B.G. that what great men do the common man will follow. So if we want actually to be successful we must convince the influential men of your country, then everything will follow automatically. So I request you to take this matter very seriously, as I think you have some special talent for it. Regarding the motion picture, it is a great opportunity, and if they actually want to do something wonderful I can come there personally and see to its direction. If it is an important film I think my personal direction is necessary. If not, then I think you can send me a synopsis of the script so that there may be nothing objectionable from the start. If this film is properly done it will be very profitable, even from the commercial point of view; and if they are interested, we can give them hundreds of stories from Bhagavat which will make wonderful films, and simultaneously the people will be educated to the proper religious and moral standard. So please try very seriously for this and I think Krishna will give you all intelligence and facility.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife and child.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
