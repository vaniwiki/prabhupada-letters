Dear Swami Jara Kumar,

Please accept my best wishes, I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 10th 1974. In this age the spiritual revolution was recommended by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He demonstrated that the Yuga Dharma for this age is the Sankirtana chanting of the holy names. If we want the degraded mass of people to be elevated, we must stop their sinful activity. To stop sinful activity one must purify the mind and the best process for purifying the mass mind is the chanting of the maha mantra Hare Krishna. This can be done in public where everyone has a chance to hear and be purified.

We experience that people are becoming more friendly and helping our movement in America simply because we are performing this sankirtana yajna. I hope you can understand this. This movement is authorized and confirmed by great acaryas as well as the sastras and also by Lord Caitanya Himself Who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, non different from Krishna.

I am presently here in India and will be staying here for some time. If you like you can visit our temple located in Munich at 8042 Oberschliessheim Dr. Hoffmeister Strasse 7, Munchen, West Germany.

I hope this meets you well.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
