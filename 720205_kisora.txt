My dear Kisora das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 30, 1971, and I have appreciated very much the sentiments therein. I can understand that you are learning our philosophy very nicely, so if you become very convinced in this way, and if you preach very vigorously in Scotland, then I think Krishna will give you every opportunity to establish this Movement very solidly there. I attended the Scottish Churches College in Calcutta, and I can remember that the Scottish professors were very much fond of philosophy. So I think if you are very much determined to preach to learned persons, that they will appreciate very much and come forward to help you.

Simply if the standard of our routine work is maintained very highly, that is, if we steadfastly perform our daily program of rising early, cleansing, chanting 16 rounds, holding kirtana wherever we are at least twice daily, reading, worshiping the deity, going on Sankirtana, like that---if this routine work is always done nicely and never neglected, then our all success is guaranteed in whatever we do. But if this our regular KC program is allowed to slacken, then everything else we try will fail. That is the simple formula for success.

So I am very pleased that you are determined to start a nice centre in Edinburgh, and this will please me very much to hear regular reports how you are doing, because I think we have been trying to start something there for some time. If you are able to present our philosophy to the student class, that will help, and also they will be interested to buy many books. So try for it and Krishna will give all assistance.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
