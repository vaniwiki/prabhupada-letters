My dear Subala das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of July 11, 1968, and it appears that things are not very happy there, in spite of Woomapati's presence. How is it that you do not get any work? Woomapati knows some technical work. Is there only work in the restaurants, and there is no other work?

Another boy, Christopher Fynn, may be going there very soon. And this letter covered is addressed to him. He is, so far I learned from Janardana, he is educated boy, and try to live together very peacefully in Krishna Consciousness. The business of Krishna Conscious persons is to enjoy by mutual association on the basis of understanding Krishna from Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. So when you become three together, you should utilize your time by discussions on Krishna, and chanting Hare Krishna. Even you do not get some job, Krishna will not put you into difficulty. But try to get some job, and work for the improvement of the temple. And whenever there is opportunity, try to chant in public parks, and collect some money from the gathering, and surely Krishna will help you. The only qualification that is required is our sincerity, and every thing will be arranged by Krishna. Hoping you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C.B.
