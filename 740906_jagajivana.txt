My dear Jagajivana Das:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 8, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am glad that you are enthusiastically taking up book distribution and have increased to 15,000 pieces per month. You have rightly understood the potency contained within my books. So far as being leader is concerned, leader means spiritually not materially. This you should understand very clearly. If spiritual potency and strength is there, then material intelligence will automatically follow. We must have a solid foundation of chanting and following the regulative principles. Then one is fit to lead others. I hope you will understand this point.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
