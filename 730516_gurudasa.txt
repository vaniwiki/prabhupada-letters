Vrindaban

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 11, 1973. I have received the picture of the front elevation of our temple, it looks very nice.

Regarding Lalitananda, formerly Hrsikesa, his proposal for joining us does not appear to be very sincere. He wants to keep himself as Bonn Maharaja's man, although he has taken permission from Bonn Maharaja to leave him and join us. Formerly it was reported that he collected money in Bombay as our representative on behalf of Bonn Maharaja and sometimes it is reported that he advertises ISKCON as a department of the Institute of Oriental Philosophy. I think you should not be very much anxious to reaccept him as our man. I have replied his letter and there is a copy enclosed, which will speak for itself.

Another thing, I beg to bring to your notice that Janaki, sister of your wife, she's now in Maya. Her husband reported that she is regularly eating meat and doing all nonsense. She's coming to Vrindaban to see her sister, Yamuna. Maybe she is going with poison arrows, so be very, very careful when she comes there. The world is full of danger and still we have to push on our Krsna Consciousness Movement. So always remain fixed up chanting the maha-mantra and following the regulative principles, because Maya is very strong.

Have you taken delivery of the document "deed of gift" of the land from the registrar's office? The receipt is there in the file box so if you have not taken delivery as yet get it and keep it carefully. Hearing from Ksirodakasayi I reported this fact to you long ago, therefore, I'm anxious to know whether the deed of gift has been taken delivery.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
