My dear Dvarakesa dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3-4-75 and have noted the contents. Thank you for sending the final edition of the Swedish Sri Isopanisad. It is very very nice. I am very anxious to see all of my books printed in the Swedish language, so continue your printing, and distributing with all enthusiasm.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
