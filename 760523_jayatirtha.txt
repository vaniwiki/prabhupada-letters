Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Jayatirtha das,

Please accept my blessings. Concerning the new temple, that you are going to purchase in London, when Madhavananda and Hansadutta were there, they were collecting funds to construct a temple there at Bhaktivedanta Manor. Please report to me what was done with these funds.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
