My dear Purusottama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated October 31, 1968 along with the letter from the Methodist Church. I suspected in the beginning that they would not allow us to work with freedom and, therefore, in spite of their promise to enter into lease agreement I wanted to clear up the situation. Now they have shown their real face so don't feel sorry for this. We know very well what is the world situation. It is my personal opinion that at the present moment except for a few persons, practically there is no man in the world who is strictly religionist, Hindu, Moslem, Christian, Buddhist.

In the ten commandments of the Bible it is clearly stated that, "Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not indulge in adultery, thou shalt not covet their servant or animals," but practically we see the so-called Christian world is full of the killing process reflected with adultery in every state encroaching upon other's property very organizedly. Similarly we find in India the so-called Hindu are doing all sorts of nonsense. So practically the whole world is without religion. Officially they claim some sectarian identification. Therefore, it is a fact that the religious principles of Krishna Consciousness which we are trying to preach under the direction of Lord Caitanya inducing people to chant HARE KRISHNA is the only panacea for the animalistic human society at the present moment. A man without religion is nothing but an animal and being every man is irreligious, therefore, the whole human society is certainly animalistic.

We do not mind because we could not get any place in the Church Center and there is no cause for your being sorry for this. You have tried your best in the service of Lord Caitanya. This is sufficient. We do not calculate the so-called success or failure we are simply to discharge our duties in Krishna Consciousness and chant HARE KRISHNA loudly.

Now as you are free you can come and join me here. When I was in Montreal you went there to join me but because you were negotiating with Church Center affairs I sent you back to New York. I was also calculating if that center is obtainable I shall make my Headquarters in New York. Now that chance being lost you are welcome to come to join me here.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Two original letters, returned herewith.
