My dear Tirtha Maharaja,

Kindly accept my humble obeisances. I hope you are in good health and everything is going all right. You will be pleased to know that we are going to install Radha-Krishna Deities in our London temple on the Odansasthi auspicious day, December 14th. This 5-story building temple is situated in the central part of London, very respectable quarters, just a few steps from the British Museum and London University. One local devotee has donated Radha-Krishna Murtis, 42" high, and the installation ceremony will go on for one week. Herewith please find our earnest invitation card for your blessings.

In this connection I beg to draw your attention to your letter to me dated February 14th, 1969, in which you assured me that I could expect some reply sometime afterwards. I am enclosing a copy of this letter for your reference. I am especially interested in the land which I asked from you within the vicinity of Caitanya Math. This is in pursuance of the desire of Srila Bhaktivinode Thakura and Srila Prabhupada. It is not for my personal use or satisfaction of personal whims. So if you would have given me a small piece of land within the vicinity of Caitanya Math, then I would not have tried to make these students home anywhere else. I hope this will find you in good health, and I am awaiting your reply with great interest.

Yours in the service of the Lord,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
