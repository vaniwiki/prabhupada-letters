Dear Sir,

All Glories to Lord Sri Krishna.

I understand from our Life Member Sri Saral Kumar Das Gupta that you are interested in Krishna Consciousness Movement. I therefore invite you to come to Sri Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir to stay with us and see our Krishna Conscious activities here.

We will then have an opportunity to present you with Krishna conscious books like Bhagavad-gita As it is, Srimad-Bhagavatam, Caitanya Caritamrta etc. for your perusal and comments.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
