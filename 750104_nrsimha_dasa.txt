My dear Nrsimha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 24th, 1974 and have noted the contents. Your idea is very nice but regarding the practicality of it, you should discuss with either the temple president or the GBC man. You should work it out together with the leaders there.

Please be very strict in following all the rules and regulations as well as chanting at least 16 good rounds daily and reading all my books thoroughly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
