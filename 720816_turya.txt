My dear Turya dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 1, 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, I shall be very glad to hear that you have installed the Deity of Lord Jagannatha, Subhadra, and Balarama, provided you and your wife are going to stick there in Mexico City and you will not go away. I have heard that you are well qualified to worship the Deity at highest standard and this is very much necessary. One who is worshiping the Deity must be always attentive and mindful of his occupation at all times. He must never for one moment forget his duty of serving the Deity at every moment and strive always to please the Lord. If you are willing to stick there in Mexico City, along with your good wife, and do the needful for worshiping Lord Jagannatha and take all responsibility, then I have no objection if you install.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
