====== Letter to: Uddhava ======

My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 25, 1969, and I thank you so much for it. Regarding the pictures in __Back To Godhead__ which you are learning to photograph, they will be of all kinds. When possible we will have nice paintings published, and other times there will be photographs of our devotees and their activities.

Krishna will surely give you all facilities and encouragement if you work for Him very sincerely because everything belongs to Krishna. It does not take Him even a second to offer anything we desire provided such thing is engaged in the service of the Lord. So you simply desire to serve Krishna best and there will be no scarcity of anything. Know it certain from me. I think that you may inform Nara Narayana that he can go immediately to New Vrindaban for construction work if he has no business in New York.

I can see from your photographs that you are preparing such big Iskcon Bullets. It is very attractive, and unfortunately I cannot share them with you. But I am very satisfied that you are enjoying such thing as the prasadam of Jagannatha Swami.

I thank you very much for your simple philosophy of following the instructions of your Spiritual Master. That is the sublime philosophy of Krishna Consciousness understanding; implicit faith in Krishna and Spiritual Master. This will make your steady progress towards the Ultimate Goal of back to Home, back to Godhead.

Thanking you again for your nice letter. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
