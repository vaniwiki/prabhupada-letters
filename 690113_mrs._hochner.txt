Dear Mrs. Hochner,

Please accept my New Year's greetings. I am so pleased to accept your token of good will and the sounding Haribol with needlework. This cloth is so nice that I have hung it in my room in front of me so that I can see Haribol and remember you always.

Your are very fortunate lady to have such nice daughters like Balai and Lilasukha. Balai is very happy with her husband, Advaita, and all of my students who are married couples are doing very nicely and living very happily. Six boys and girls who were married under my superintendence are now working in London, and they are making very hopeful adventures. Here in Los Angeles also there is one married couple, Dayananda and Nandarani, and they also are doing very nicely in improving the temple here. Your son-in-law, Advaita das, is being trained up to take charge of our press. Your daughter is a first class typist, so in this way all are fully cooperating with me, and I am happy in your country.

My endeavors might be sincere, but without their cooperation I could not have executed my mission so quickly. I thank you once more for your becoming the mother of two devotee girls.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
