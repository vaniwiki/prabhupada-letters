Dear Mr. Senior Dambergs,

Kindly accept my greetings. I am unknown to you but I have heard about you from your very good grandson Sriman Janardana (Janis). I have heard that you have been ailing since a long time but I have heard also that you are a great devotee of Lord Jesus Christ. It is very good. I am also an insignificant servant of Lord Jesus Christ because I am preaching the same message as Lord Jesus did. I'm preaching God consciousness or Krishna consciousness. Fools thought that Lord Jesus Christ was dead by crucifixion but He resurrected. All living entities are parts and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore they are also eternal. All our ailments are due to the external body. Although we have to suffer some time from bodily inconveniences specially in the old age, still if we are God conscious, we shall not feel the pangs. The best thing is therefore to Chant the holy Name of the Lord Constantly. I would you request you to chant always God's holy Name. We are chanting God's holy name always and instructing our students to do so. If you have any holy name for God do chant Him always and it will do you the greatest benefit. And by chanting so when you will be remembering Him always then you transfer to the Kingdom of God is guaranteed. When you return to the Kingdom of God there is no necessity to come back again to the rotten world full of miseries. We are chanting God's Name as

> Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
> Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.

The Lord Has millions of holy names and you can chant any one of them and each and every Name of the Lord is full potential. We chant the abovementioned holy Name of the Lord because the name was Chanted by Lord Caitanya the father of this movement of Krishna Consciousness. We follow Lord Caitanya's footprints to achieve very quick result. I would advise you also to follow the principle. Krishna means the most attractive reservoir of Pleasure. Who does not want such pleasure? Therefore we want Krishna and nothing more.

Hope you will understand me right. May Krishna give you all peace of mind. You are so lucky that you have got a nice boy like Janis as descendant of your good family. He will render you greatest service to your family by his becoming Krishna conscious,

Yours very sincerely\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
