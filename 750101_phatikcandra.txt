My dear Phatikcandra das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 13rd, 1974 and have noted the contents. I simply request you to chant 16 rounds daily without fail and follow all the regulative principles. Rise early, attend temple functions and study my books carefully. Work closely and take advice from your elder godbrothers like the temple president and the GBC.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
