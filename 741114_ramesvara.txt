My dear Ramesvara dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated two on October 3, 1974 and one November 7, 1974 with enclosed press proofs of color pages of Bhagavad-gita. Now it was proposed that we would purchase the rights to print Bhagavad-gita As It Is ourselves. What happened to the proposal to buy the rights from Macmillan? This color pages you have submitted are not better. I do not find any improvement. There is no improvement.

Regarding the problems of the C.C. Ādi Lila Vol. 1 being 600 pages, what can I say? That is for you to arrange. But I do not think it will look good if you change the quality of paper from one volume to one volume as you have proposed. Not that one volume should be lighter paper and one volume heavier paper.

It is very good that you are also going on Sankirtana and distributing books. Others will also be enthused to distribute by your personal example. This is our life. "anandambudhi-vardhanam."

Regarding not being able to make any more loans from BBT, I think if necessary we can borrow from the bank using the fixed deposits as security. So long as the loans are not paid back to the bank we shall assure that we shall not withdraw the fixed deposits. These properties should be purchased in the name of BBT, and when the local center repays the loan, then the name can be transferred. Now you have loaned Madhudvisa Dollars 133,505.50. How will he repay? What are the terms for repayment? In France they are wanting to borrow Dollars 120,000.00. Can you arrange for this loan in January, 1975? I understand that Spiritual Sky is not able to repay its loan now. This rule must be strictly followed that 50% paid for printing and 50% paid for property and building loans.

Gurukrpa Swami has informed that on October 31 he paid DNP Dollars 60,000.00. So he has paid approximately Dollars 100.000.00, but here in India only approximately Dollars 86,500.00 has been received. Please explain.

Regarding printing in USA for sending a man to the press to check the work, yes do it. Yes, print quickly in USA our books. The quality of S.B. 3:4 is not bad.

Regarding the book distribution, somehow the distribution must be doubled and tripled as far as possible. Do it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
