Dear Sir:

I beg to inform you that on account of the Krishna Consciousness Movement started by me in the Western countries I have got many thousands of disciples. These disciples want to pay me something as a matter of etiquette and I want to utilize this money for printing different kinds of books on this Krishna Consciousness Movement.

So instead of taking money from them, I want to convert the money into books on this Krishna Consciousness Movement and get them into India without any payment. Kindly give me necessary permission for this noble activity.

Thanking you in anticipation for an early reply.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
