My dear Dr. Singhal, Mr. Saraf, Dr. Poddar, Mr. Vasista and Sriman Giriraja,

Please accept my blessings. This morning Srukirti received telephonic message from Bali Mardan. It is understood that Mr. Nair is dead. So it is good news that Nrsimhadeva has killed a demon like him. Prahlada Maharaja said that even a saintly person becomes pleased when a scorpion or a snake is killed. So if it is a fact that Nair is dead it is a matter of great pleasure for all devotees.

When I left Bombay I formed a committee of you all to negotiate with Mr. Nair but I did not hear anything from you since I left. What is the position now? If possible settle with Mrs. Nair paying her cash down or Rs. 1,400,000/. Out of Rs. 1,400,000 suppose we have Rs. 500,000/ and the balance Rs. 900,00/ can be advanced by any mortgager. If it is possible try to do it. Otherwise unless Mrs. Nair pays back all our invested money in the Juhu land do not vacate the land under any circumstances. If you stick to your principles certainly Krishna will help and the indications are already there.

I hope this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
