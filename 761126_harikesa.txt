My dear Harikesa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 24/11/76.

Yes, I approve of your helping to rectify the situation in Germany.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I have received the $480 sent with Gurudasa. Thank you very much. I think this clears your loan.\\
