Mayapur

Dear Bharadraja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 2 January 1974.

Regarding a photographic exhibit in Mayapur. This is an important part of our Caitanya Festival in Mayapur. Bali Mardan is here and he has agreed that the photographers at ISKCON Press can blow up photographs of our propaganda work and men can take them who are going to Mayapur. As for mounting them, however, that you can do there, and arrange them into an exhibit.

I have got good reports of your working on the dioramas. I will be pleased to see your work when I come to Mayapur.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
