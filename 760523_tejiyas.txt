New Delhi

My dear Tejyas das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 14-5-76, and I have noted the contents with care. The house that you have rented in New Delhi appears very nice. However is there any garden?*

Concerning your personal service, when I come I shall personally take this up with you. You can come and personally speak with me when I return to India.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
