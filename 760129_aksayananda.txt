My dear Aksayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 23rd January, 1976 and I have noted the contents.

I have read the letter of Mr. Kapur. I am agreeable to coming to Kanpur; the question is when. You are planning a program at the Prayag Narayana Mandir on the 15th Feb. I know that Temple, it is very famous. If some program is held there, all Kanpur people will come. Just now I am resting at Mayapur, so if it is possible to hold this program without me, then I may not come. Otherwise, if my presence is required* then I can come. Following the Vrndavana festival there is a tentative program for me to go to Manipur. At that time I can easily visit Kanpur on my way to Manipur. Visiting at that time would be very convenient. We should certainly have a centre in Kanpur. It is the third most important city in India after Bombay and Calcutta.

It is not possible to give you definite answer on the land of Mr. Bhargava at this time. We have to wait to see what is the condition of the land during monsoon. If it is not too disturbed we can take it. We will have to wait until July at least to decide. If we get the Kailash Mandir land and this land has a Gosala, it will be a good combination.

I am glad that you are developing the mukut business. Now the devotees must learn so that in the future professionals will not be required.

Regarding holding feasts on Dvadasi days, we don't want to invite some beggar class of men. Don't invite now. When Randas Shastri and Vishvambar think best then we shall invite.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
