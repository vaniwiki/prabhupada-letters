My dear Abhinanda and Gopesvara das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 15, 1975 from Bhuvaneśvara and was very glad to read the contents how you are selling books there. You have done a great service, and I am very pleased with you. So far for selling books in India, we do not require a license. We are already selling our books there. From where have you gotten this idea? Perhaps they clear the books from the customs on this plea. Anyway, why not obtain an import license and do the needful.

Regarding a book agent, we have got our agent, India Book House in Calcutta. Find out if they are importing. Also Gopala Krishna is arranging with our printer in Delhi who can also import books.

Regarding reducing the sale price of the Srimad-Bhagavatams, Gopala Krishna is arranging for a new printing of Volume One Number 1 in Delhi. For what the book is costing to print, it should be sold for @ Rs. 50/-, but for a poor man we can reduce the price by 25% so it could be sold for Rs. 38/.

You appear to be a very intelligent boy. We have got a land in Bhuvaneśvara. Can you develop it?

Your proposal for travelling and distributing books all over India is very good. Krishna will bless you with His mercy. Take books and sell and spend for your expenses.

I hope this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
