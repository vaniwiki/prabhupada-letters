My dear Dr. Ghosh, 

Please accept my greetings and prayers for you and your family’s well being.

As I think you know, Sri Acharya Omkar Giri, the Mahant of the Beni Madhav Temple, is keen on giving the temple to us so that we can improve everything. I have requested Sri Giriji to see you in connection with making a Deed of Gift. If it is possible, kindly engage some lawyer friend and do the needful to make this transaction perfect. Enclosed please find a true copy of a letter recently received from him which will give you an idea of the situation.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
