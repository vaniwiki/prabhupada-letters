====== Letter to: Oliver ======

My dear Oliver,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated August 5th, 1969, and I am very much pleased with your nice handwriting and the purport of it. You have so quickly picked up the importance of the Hare Krishna Movement and are so much eager for propagating Krishna Consciousness. That means you are already recognized by Krishna. In your previous life you must have cultivated Krishna Consciousness. As we learn from Bhagavad-gita, it is said there that a person who does not reach to the final goal of Krishna Consciousness is again given the opportunity to fulfill the mission of achieving perfection. So my request to you is that you should try to complete the process of Krishna Consciousness in this very life, without waiting for another term of cultivation. Of course a devotee either in this world or in the spiritual world, his connection with Krishna being fixed up, is equally happy anywhere. But so long we are in this material world there is constant allurement of Maya, and sometimes we fall victim.

So try to understand this philosophy of Krishna Consciousness by reading our books and literatures, discussing amongst the devotees and chanting Hare Krishna Mantra as much as possible. Whenever there is any inquiries, you can write to me directly, and I shall try to reply them.

I am just awaiting the letter of Krishna das for starting to Hamburg. But if I do not receive such letter from him within this week, then the program may be changed.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
