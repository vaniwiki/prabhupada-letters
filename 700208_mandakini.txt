My dear Daughter Mandakini,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 28 January, 1970, along with your beads. Thank you very much. I am very glad to accept you as my disciple because you want to learn how to serve Krishna, and I am returning your beads duly chanted upon by me.

Please chant sixteen rounds of beads daily following the rules and four restrictions and avoiding the ten offenses in chanting the Holy Name of Krishna. Please learn our Krishna Consciousness way of life from the good guidance of the older devotees there.

I am so glad to learn that you are nicely appreciating the bliss of Krishna Consciousness and are endeavoring to become pure in this association. If you continue in this attitude you will progress more and more in your service. So chant Hare Krishna Mantra and be happy. That is my desire.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Mandakini is the name of the river flowing through the heavenly planets. On this planet this river is known as Ganges. This water was kindly let down into this universe by the lotus foot of Krishna in His incarnation as Vamana.
