Sripada Narayana Maharaja,\\
I received your letter dated 20.9.66 on time. Our relationship is certainly based on spontaneous love. That is why there is no chance of us forgetting one another. With the mercy of Guru and Gauranga may everything be auspicious for you. This is my constant prayer. From the first time I saw you I have been your constant well-wisher. At his first sight of me Srila Prabhupada also saw me with such love. It was in my very first darsana of Srila Prabhupada that I learned how to love. It is his boundless mercy that he has engaged an unworthy person like me, in fulfilling some of his desires. It is his causeless mercy to engage me in preaching the message of Sri Rupa and Sri Raghunatha.

The preaching work is going very well here. I sent a copy of my description of this along with the letter. You may try to print it if you can, and you can copy it and give this news to different newspapers. Here the government is very cautious about preaching any other religion except Christianity. Therefore I am ordered to leave after staying for only one year. I am also ready to return, but my disciples do not want me to go. They are arranging to file a suit against this order of the government. Five hundred dollars will be spent, about Rs 4000/-. They are prepared to spend that much money. The above mentioned American gentlemen will hold a meeting tonight, and within twenty-four hours they will arrange a lawyer to be paid. So it seems I have to stay here longer, to fulfill the desire of Srila Prabhupada. Even though they keep me in all kinds of comfort and convenience, still my mind is anxious to return to Vrndavana, and I am enthusiastic to see you all.

I am sending the description of the preaching along with this letter. One check for Rs 1500/- is also included. In the price list that you have given, the total comes to Rs 1544/- but by mistake you have written Rs 1080/-. Anyway I shall adjust more or less and send it to you later. Everything needs to be packed properly and sent to Calcutta or Cochin. Where to send, I shall write to you in my next letter.

My room is locked in Delhi. If you or any of your faithful preachers want to preach in Delhi, let me know. If you want to work in Delhi, you can use that room and preach. If you continue going to Delhi, then my publication work can be taken care of, under your observation.

You wrote to me, "You can engage me in any preaching work in India according to my ability. I shall always be ready to do so." So I can preach whole-heartedly by your good wishes.

Here, fifteen educated boys have accepted discipleship from me (sishawatho). They have given up wine, meat, intoxication, marijuana, tea, coffee, eggs etc., and are honoring krsna-prasadam given by me every day. They never knew how to take dahl, capati, rice, spinach, milk and fruits, but now by eating such prasada, they are quite happy and are always attentively doing their service. Therefore, when these young boys are fully ready, vast preaching will take place in these Western countries through them. I always remind them that I am old. "At any time I may have to say namaskara to Yamaraja, so you all try to understand this Krsna consciousness philosophy properly." I think that they are trying to take this up properly. Otherwise, why would they spend Rs 4000/- to Rs 5000/- to file a suit to try to keep me here? Anyway, by the mercy of Krsna and your good wishes and blessings, I feel no inconvenience. My health is also good. My only concern is that due to my absence from India my printing work is held up. Regarding this, if you can supervise a little, then I will have no worry. In Delhi, I have a householder disciple and there are also one or two others, but they have no experience in printing. If you can supervise, then Sriman Candrasekhara and his son Candra Mohana will help you. I have a proper press, a supply of papers, and an arrangement with the officials, but no one to look after it. Let me know your opinion as soon as you receive my letter. There is a press in Mathura, but it is not as convenient as Delhi. The books could be printed in America. The final printing is very good, but very expensive. It is also difficult to bring money from India, so the printing has to be done there. There is no doubt about it.

What you have heard about the temple is true. Sir Padampat from Kanpur is ready to spend as much as is required to make a Radha-Krsna temple in New York. But it was not possible for the currency exchange with the government of India. Half of the Srimad Bhagavatams I brought with me are distributed. Here, the high-ranking people consider Bhagavan's devotees to be insane. In the beginning I tried to associate with them. I became acquainted with the secretary of the governor and others; but seeing their demoniac nature I have focussed my attention on the middle class--especially towards the young and educated. Here the young educated __sampradaya__ are disgusted with Western civilization. Theye are being ruined by taking marijuana and associating with women. The government does not care for them. They are sent to the Vietnam War by force. The political situation here is not good. This means that their future is not very bright. Because of this condition, Sriman Mahaprabhu has come to this country. I am trying to give them the dust of His lotus feet and those who are accepting are feeling joy. They are accepting me with love, thinking that I can give them life. You will come to know all this news in the joint report.

A crosscheck is being sent. It will not be difficult to cash it if you have a bank account. Otherwise you can collect money with the help of Bon Maharaja or other friends. Please reply to me as soon as you receive my letter.
