My dear Ādi Kesava das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 8th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your proper engagement, you should first discuss that with your GBC and try to work something out together. Regarding your questions. I have already answered the most important question. "How to please Krishna?"---by following all the regulative principle that I have given you, chanting 16 rounds and reading my books scrutinizingly. Everyone must do these things, otherwise they cannot understand Krishna Consciousness.

I have accepted the four persons that you have recommended for second initiation and their threads and mantra sheet are enclosed herein. I have also accepted the six persons you have recommended for first initiation. Their names are: Edward---Sadasiva dasa, Robert---Rupa dasa, Susan---Sitapati dasi, Theothora-Tryadhisa dasi, Mildred---Mahalaksmi dasi, David---Dharmasetu dasa. Their beads can be chanted on by Kirtanananda Svami.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enc: 3 threads and mantra sheet.
