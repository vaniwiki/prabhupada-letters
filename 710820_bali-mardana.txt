My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 10th August, 1971, and have noted the contents. I am so glad to note that book distribution is going on nicely. Also there are many Krsna Books in L.A., so if you want to, you can ask Karandhara to send some. That will be nice.

Rahul is a good boy, coming from a good family and very qualified. So keep him very affectionately. Treat him as a younger brother or son, and so nicely that he will never want to go away. Whatever foodstuffs he wants may be given to him. Always he should be kept engaged translating and it should be checked by Ramananda and Ksirodakasayi because you don't know Hindi.

There is so much new information in our books and the Hindi reading public will appreciate it, because our subject matter is new to everyone. God has always been a vague idea. So most people are impersonalists or voidists. Perhaps for the first time in the world we are giving the people a clear idea of what is God. Although God, or Krsna, was existing in the world, but demons like Kamsa wanted to kill Him. Therefore people have no clear idea. So this is the first time we are placing Krsna in tangible form with a clear idea of His name, fame, qualities, pastimes, etc.

That Madison Square program was simply speculation. Syamasundara had some vague idea about it, but it has proved not at all substantial for our purposes.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
