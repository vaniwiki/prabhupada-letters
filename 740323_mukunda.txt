Bhaktivedanta Manor

Dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed please find a recent letter which was mailed and addressed to me, by Sarva Suhrit. By this letter he has put into writing his criminal intentions. I think you know him also, and there is no telling what he may actually attempt to do. Therefore I want you to go to the proper Scotland Yard investigators and present the letter by Sarva Suhrit. He constitutes a menace; he should be punished and a court case should be taken if necessary.

Of course, as preachers we have to expect to face so many opposing elements, and actually we are doing so. Moreover, we are always protected by Krsna. But this crazy threat for our destruction should not go unchecked; please do the needful and let me know the outcome. You may send your regular report on activities at Bhaktivedanta Manor to me here at my Bombay address.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
