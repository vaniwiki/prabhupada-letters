====== Letter to: Guptaji ======

Delhi

My dear Guptaji,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. Please come immediately and please bring one nice English to Bengali dictionary, prepared either by Subala Mitra or Ashutosh Deva. The price may be taken from the Temple to purchase it.

I shall be in Vrindaban up till the 8th, and then after going to Aligarh and Chandigarh I shall return about 17th-18th inst.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
