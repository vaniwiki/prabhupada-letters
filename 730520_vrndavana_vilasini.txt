My dear Vrndavana Vilasini,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter undated. Thank you very much for the very nice bead bag and kurta.

I am very pleased to hear that you are distributing many of my books, especially Krsna Book. You are a very sincere girl. Please continue to engage wholeheartedly in Krsna's service and there is no doubt that you may go back to home, back to Godhead in this life.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
