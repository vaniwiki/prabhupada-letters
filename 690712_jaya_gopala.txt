====== Letter to: Jaya Gopala ======

My dear Jaya Gopala,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 4, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. For the time being you should go on with your work there. I shall consult with Tamala Krishna, and if possible I shall try to send devotees there to help you. In the meantime you should continue going out on Sankirtana as much as possible and preach to the many boys and girls with whom you come into contact there. Krishna Consciousness is the absolute need of the present day society, and there are many people who will come to join us if we simply make these teachings of Bhagavad-gita and rest of the Vedic literature available to them. So try to sell __Back to Godheads__ as far as you are able to do with only Arundhati and yourself on Sankirtana Party, and soon others will come to join you. I have no objection to sending you some men from Los Angeles, but you also should try to recruit some men from amongst the residents of Columbus. That is the best plan. Simply let them hear our chanting, invite them to our temple Love Feasts, and automatically some intelligent boys and girls will become interested to associate with our movement. You are a very sincere worker, so go on increasing your enthusiasm, and you will see how Krishna provides everything nicely for your center.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
