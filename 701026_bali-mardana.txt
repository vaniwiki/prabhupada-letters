Tokyo

My dear Bali-mardana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Tokyo, October 11th, 1970, and noted the contents.

I am very glad to know where you are and how you are proceeding on your program for opening new centers in the area of the South Pacific. I do not know if you are going first to Hong Kong as you wrote before or if you are going to Taiwan as you have just now mentioned.

There is no question of new or strange places as you have written to say. This Hare Krsna Mantra is understood in any part of the world, therefore the beginning should be chanting in any place and then people will gather and a center will develop by the grace of Lord Krsna.

Yes, I have received a letter from Upendra, but I have no information whether his wife has gone there to Fiji.

I am very pleased with your sincere service attitude in pushing on our preaching work in these parts of the world and yes, Krsna will give you strength because He is sitting in your heart and the more you try to serve Him, He will give you more intelligence.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
