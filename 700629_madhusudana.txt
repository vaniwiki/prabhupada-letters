My dear Madhusudana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 24th June, 1970, with your check for $200, for which I think you and your good wife, Kancanbala. This kind of letter is very encouraging to me because there is enclosure of a nice check. So we have to pay immediately some bills of ISKCON Press as well as Dai Nippon, so it will be very much helpful.

I am very much glad to learn that you have appreciated the subject matter of __Nectar of Devotion__ and __Krsna__ while working on it in the press, and actually these two books will keep us constantly in Krsna consciousness. The secret of Krsna consciousness is open in these two books. Our method is very simple. All different methods of self-realization are little or more troublesome. This is explained in the __Bhagavad-gita__ 12th chapter that persons who have no fixed idea what is God will have unnecessarily more trouble to reach to the goal. Krsna is the ultimate objective. Unless one therefore reaches to this point he remains imperfect never mind what he is either a karmi, or a jnani, or a yogi. For a devotee the objective is directly approached. So persons will be interested simply in reading our books wherein there is only Krsna consciousness described in transcendental varieties. Thus by reading of these books, especially __Nectar of Devotion,__ by the devotees everyone will go back to home, back to Godhead, Krsna.

So I wish that all of you, especially those that are married couples, may combinedly advance in Krsna consciousness being constantly engaged in His loving service and that will make me very happy.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls. There is some discrepancy in the layout of the __Krsna Consciousness Handbook__ and this will be pointed out by Devananda.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
