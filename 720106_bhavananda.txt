My dear Bhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. Just now Syamasundara has gone to Delhi for some meetings with important government ministers. So presently I cannot send the airline ticket for Aravinda, because Syamasundara has kept it somewhere. So as soon as he returns which should be within a few days, then the ticket will be immediately sent to Calcutta.

I am very anxious for Lord Caitanya's Appearance Day to be celebrated by all of our devotees in Mayapur in February. There is no reason why the government will not let 20 or 25 of our men come there for two weeks. We have got our own land and we must celebrate this occasion as an important part of our religious beliefs. We will go there on the 15th February and by the end of the month we shall all return to Calcutta leaving only six or so men to stay there in Mayapur. So do everything with great determination as I want very much that this occasion shall be observed by all of our members. Write me and tell me what is your progress.

I hope this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Whether a duplicate of my yellow fever card can be obtained. I will be going to Nairobi by the 24th of January and shall require it again when I return. Acyutananda knows the hospital where it can be obtained. %%___%% many times for the duplicate certificate.
