My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated from Vrndavana as well as two previous letters dated November 10th, 1970 and two letters carried here by Mr. H. S. Gupta. I have met Mr. Gupta last evening and his idea was to advertise so that people may know that if they go travelling in foreign countries they may stay in Temples there. But we cannot advertise like that. When someone becomes a life member, we can inform him that he may stay at our foreign Temples as privilege of a life member, but we are not inviting anyone and everyone to stay as if we are in the hotel business.

I am glad that you are enthusiastic about prospects in Delhi, and if you like to work there, do it. We have initiated a system for making life members, that daily three members must be made in Bombay, daily two in Calcutta, and daily one in Delhi. In this way of six Life members daily, we shall very quickly expand our Society in India. This Life Membership is the support of our Movement here, so you must stress this program especially. That will be our success.

Your report from Vrndavana is good. I think you should negotiate for the first palace near Kesighat, called Laksmikunj, from the Maharaja of Bharatapur. That place is just suitable for us. It should be easier to come to terms for this place also because it is vacant. If you can establish one nice palatial Temple for our Society in Vrndavana, that will be a great credit for you. I am awaiting your telegram or telephone call in this connection.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Regarding Atma Ram and Sons, you can inform them that we are expecting our shipment to arrive soon. In the meantime, the old dust jackets may be distributed for our advertising purposes to Calcutta, Delhi and Bombay. At least half the quantity should be sent immediately to me here in Bombay.\\
