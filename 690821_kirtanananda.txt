====== Letter to: Kirtanananda ======

My Dear Kirtanananda, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of 12 August, 1969, sent along with a package of sandesh. I am sorry that I was not able to see how you have nicely made the sandesh because upon arrival it was found to have gone bad. So I do not think it will be practical to continue sending foodstuffs through the mail. It has not proven successful. Anyway, I thank you very much for your efforts in this connection. Your proposal to sell sandesh to the temples will also not be practical.

I am very pleased to learn that there is a new boy living in New Vrindaban, named Dan, and please help him advance nicely in Krishna Consciousness. You have not mentioned anything about Jadunanda and Taruna Dasi. I hope everything is going nicely for them and their child in New Vrindaban. As the Composer I.B.M. machine will be in Columbus by this time, Hayagriva and Shamadasi may go there to take care of the book composition as early as possible.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
