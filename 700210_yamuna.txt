My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and I was so glad to learn that you have defeated four of the whips of the Ramakrishna Mission by giving quotation from the Bhagavad-gita. It is a fact that all other institutions, never mind whether it is Ramakrishna Mission or philosophical speculators, nobody can stand our arguments and reason if we can support them by quoting Scriptures. So if we thoroughly study the books which we have so far published, as well as serve Krsna in great devotion by following the regulative principles, we shall be able to defeat anyone who is not in Krsna Consciousness. So do it nicely, and everyone of you become great preachers.

Please write me occasionally about your activities and train the initiated girls to assist you in all respects.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
