====== Letter to: Hrdayananda ======

Sao Paulo, Brazil

My dear Hrdayananda Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 9, 1975 with the enclosed books in Portuguese. It is very nice, and I am glad to learn that our movement is being nicely received there.

So I am prepared to come to South America, but the Venezuela Consulate in Los Angeles informs that they have government order not to give me visa. What is the meaning? You can try to arrange programs in Panama, Trinidad, and Guyana, so I can get down there on my way to Brazil. But, if there is any difficulty in getting the visa for these countries, then we may suspend the program. I do not want to take any risk, just like in Nairobi I was refused entry and it was a great inconvenience. This is not good for me.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
