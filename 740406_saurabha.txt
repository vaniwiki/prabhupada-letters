====== Letter to: Saurabha ======

Vrindaban

Dear Saurabha,

Please accept my blessings. I have seen the letter of 4/4/74 you have written to Tamala Krsna Goswami.

I am very very happy to learn the by Krsna's and Baladeva.'s mercy a sweet water well has been found about ten feet away from the front part of the land, on our side. This is Krsna's mercy on us. Now build a big well there. Make an __idara,__ make the well 100 feet deep and big and fix a pump so that you can always take water from. This news about the well has pleased me very much. Also, because the tamal tree is blooming so nicely you may let it stand; do not cut it down, but let it grow.

As for the shortage of coolies, our men can do this job. Any man can work as a cooly, so our men should join. We shall also send men from here and elsewhere so you may have 10 or 20 men. Cooly means non expert, and so many of our men are non expert so they may join and work as coolies.

If you are collecting money from Mr. Bajoria or any life members take it and send it to the construction fund at New Delhi, in the Punjab National Bank. As far as Mr. Somani, let him come here and I will be very glad to receive him. If he can supply us paper we can start a Back to Godhead magazine in Hindi and Gujarati.

Regarding your report on the marble, let us apply the best one, as indicated by you, even if it costs Rs 8 per square foot including labor. So make contract, take delivery of the stone and engage this man who is the same one doing the Birla Mandir. I have sent a check for Rs 23,000 to Tejyas in Delhi so there is no scarcity of money. This temple must be finished by the deadline. Work very swiftly keeping in view everything expertly and solidly.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
