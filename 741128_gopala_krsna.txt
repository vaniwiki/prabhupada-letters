My dear Gopala Krishna das:

Please accept my blessings. I have read your letter dated November 21, 1974 addressed to Brahmananda Swami with enclosed picture from "Back to Godhead." Even they have changed her face, still it was not possible to hide the fact that she is old, like great grandmother. Because you are a devotee you could not tolerate the nonsense. You are a very good boy. I know that whatever money you have left over from maintaining your family, you give that to the Society. You do not even keep anything for yourself. This is very good.

It is very good that you are still trying for a new building. It is long overdue. Why not the same Park Avenue building if it is available? I think that if you all try, it will not be difficult to obtain the required money to obtain it.

You have marked that she bought a Toyota car with temple funds, so how could she be a Toyota. You have used your common sense. She wanted to hide herself in so many ways, just like this picture, but she could not.

Bali Mardan says that taking milk is also the same as eating meat, therefore you can eat meat. Therefore does it mean that because what I eat all turns to stool, then I should eat stool? If everything I eat turns to stool, does it mean I should eat stool? Is this sound logic? He was a sincere boy, but he has fallen down by bad association. Still I can rectify both of them, provided they agree.

If possible send me his address. I want to write to him. I asked him to correct himself, not to leave. Anyway if he agrees he can be corrected. Jagai agreed to the terms of Caitanya Mahaprabhu and was corrected by the Lord.

I Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
