My dear Dinesh,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 17th, 1970. Regarding the letter from Mr. Gangulee, it is very nice that he has agreed to write it and the copies should be attached to each and every visa of the devotees as you have mentioned---that is very good proposal. But regarding taking the visas, they are already coming, Hansadutta and Himavati are already here and I have received telegram that the others are leaving London and expect to be here on the 3rd of October. Anyway, you are managing the affair nicely so far, so please see whatever remains to be done is finished up properly. This is an important matter and up to now it is going on well. So whatever you do in this connection, I am sure of its being alright.

I am very glad to learn that both you and your good wife, Krsna devi, and your daughter, Visnu Arati, are together in Boston. Your all engagements sound to be very suitable, so please execute your duties in Krsna Consciousness and be happy. I am especially pleased that you are taking charge in the Boston area of placing my books and literatures in the local school-college libraries and you have already had success with placing all our literatures in the two most important libraries of Harvard University and the Divinity School. When I spoke there sometimes back our Krsna Consciousness philosophy was very much appreciated, so I think this is an important place for our literatures to be available to the students and faculty. Please go on with this engagement enthusiastically and Krsna will give you all success in the venture. You are intelligent and hard working devotee of Krsna and Krsna will bless you for this very fine service which you are rendering unto Him.

Devananda Maharaja has sent you a separate letter which will be self explanatory. We are having some troubles with the electrical machinery here.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
