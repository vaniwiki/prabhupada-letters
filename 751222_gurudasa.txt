My dear Guru das Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received the letters of appreciation of your preaching work. Thank you very much, you are very competent, and if you continue like this you will get strength from Krishna more and more.

I always say, man is good, and woman is also good, but when they combine, then they become bad. Before there was so much difficulty, but now you are doing well and Yamuna dasi is also doing well, and I am very pleased with your work. Please continue like this and keep me informed.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
