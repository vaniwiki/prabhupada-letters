My dear Tikandas J. Batra,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for our letter dated Nov. 26, 1975. I do not know where one could find copies of the old Back to Godhead started by me back in 1944 it is a long time ago. If you write to our Los Angeles center they may be able to send you some of the back issues of the more recent publications.

Regarding your question about Brahma Samhita, it was found by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu in a temple on his travels thru south India. There are supposed to be 100 chapters, but this is the only chapter which is known to date.

Regarding your question about Vaikuntha; the example is The King and the bed bug, both of them are sitting on the same throne, but the business of the King is to rule and the bed bug's business is to bite. The place is the same, but the consciousness is different. It is said the Lord is situated in everyone's heart, so that means Krishna is also in the heart of a hog, and he is also in the heart of a demigod, but that does not mean that God has become a hog, or a demigod, God is always in Vaikuntha. Similarly, those who are God conscious, Pure devotees of the Lord, they are always in Vaikuntha, there is nothing like material for them.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
