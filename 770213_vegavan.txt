Dear Vegavan,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of 19 January and examined the contents.

It gives me great pleasure to hear that the Bhagavad-gita As It Is will soon be published in the Swedish language.

On your recommendation, I have accepted the two devotees for first initiation, and their spiritual names are as follows:

Ryno Svensson%%---------%%Raivata Dasa\\
Helga Svensson%%-------%%Hiranyangi Dasi\\
I have also accepted Yogendra Das Brahmacari for second initiation. Enclosed find one sanctified thread and the gayatri mantra. Have him hear the recording of me in the right ear. You may hold a fire yajna for the first initiations.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
