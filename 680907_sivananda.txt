My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 1, 1968, and I am glad that you are getting some encouragement in Berlin. I request you not to leave Berlin. I request that you please try to establish a center there at any cost. In your last letter you informed me that there is good chance of your getting work on a salary of $600.00. So if you can get such job, or any job, somehow or other, you can simply maintain an apartment and sit down there and chant Hare Krishna. I do not want immediately a very large storefront or anything like that. I simply want that a center may immediately be started in Berlin and gradually we will try to develop it. In my last letter I have already informed you that some of the San Francisco boys are ready to go and join you. If required I shall ask Acyutananda to join you from India. So that way you can have several assistants to perform kirtana, and that will be our success.

I also had a letter from the Finnish boy sent by you and it appears that he is enthusiastic. So you can also get some cooperation. On the whole, it is my desire that you establish one center immediately in Berlin. Don't go elsewhere for the present. Later one we can try to open centers in Zurich or Amsterdam or Stockholm as Krishna will desire. You will be pleased to know that Syamasundara with wife and child has already entered London with 6 month visa, and is to be followed by Mukunda and others, very soon.

Hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I am going tomorrow to San Francisco, and you can reply this letter there, at 518 Frederick Street, San Francisco, Cal. 94117. I have received one letter from Syamasundara, has arrived in London, and his address is 80 Herne Hill, London S.E. 24, England. (send c/o Samuel Speerstra) You can correspond with your Godbrothers there.
