My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letters dated July 16th, 22nd and 27th, and I have noted all of the contents carefully. I have also received some photographs of your Rathayatra Day ceremony, sent to me by Sri Govinda. It appears to be very, very nice, and I am having these photographs reprinted together on one page so I may show the others how nicely you have done it. I have already told Gurudasa something of the glorious affair that was arranged here, and enclosed please find reprinted news articles from the San Francisco papers.

I am pleased to learn that you now have Radha-Krishna Murtis given to you by Mataji Syamadevi. For the time being you should keep Them covered, and when I go there I shall install Them and teach you how to do everything nicely. In the meantime you should not tend these Deities, but a nice throne should be constructed in the same fashion as the picture which was sent to you recently. In Los Angeles temple they have constructed a beautiful throne, just on the measurements and colors as depicted on the picture sent to you, and it has come very successful.

In the photographs sent by Sri Govinda I have seen the nice brahmacaris of our London Yatra. I hope that by now they have received their beads, duly chanted upon by me. Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
