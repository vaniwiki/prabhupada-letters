My dear Sri A. S. Khanna,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated and have noted the contents. You will be glad to know that by the first week of January, 1972, I will be returning to Bombay for about two weeks, and I shall be glad to see you at that time.

I am so glad to learn that Gopala and Ekayani are coming to Bombay to see you. So I am pleased also that Gopala's mother will be able to see her beloved son and daughter-in-law.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
