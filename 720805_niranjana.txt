Varanasi

My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter from Bhilai dated July 7, 1972 and I have noted the contents carefully. I am sending the letter to Varanasi as you indicate that you will be leaving Bhilai by August 4. It appears that the working on the committee will be too much difficult for you, so it will be better if you can serve Krishna by translating into Hindi language. Ksirodakasayi is with me now in London and he will not be returning to India, so you may consult with Ramananda in Gorakhpur what should be your exact duty. For the time being, as you are studying in Varanasi and cannot leave that place, it is better for you to translate individually in cooperation with Ramananda, and at some later time when your studies are completed, then we can discuss further.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
