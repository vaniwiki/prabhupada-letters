Calcutta

My dear Gargamuni Swami:

Please accept my blessings. Regarding the registration of ISKCON Calcutta center as a separate entity, it should be clearly understood by you that the registration cannot be applied for unless my express sanction is there. No papers should be filed without my permission. Any papers you may draw up must be submitted to me first before filing.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
