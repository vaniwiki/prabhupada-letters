Bangalore

My dear Aksojananda Maharaja and Pancadravida Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of 3rd June from Bangalore.

Do not be discouraged if so far the collections have not been very great in terms of money. More important than the results is the activity. Krsna wants to see that you are fully engaged with all sincerity in preaching His glories; that will please Him, not a certain amount of money. Moreover, if you remain determined in that activity, then automatically the results will come. It is like a woman who becomes married; if she immediately desires to have a child, that is not possible. But because she is associating with her husband, after due time, in 9 months she may have a child. We have to be enthusiastic, determined and patient in the execution of our duties.

Continue to send your collections to the BBT in Bombay. I shall be glad to hear the progressive reports of your preaching, and now you may report regularly to Karandhara Prabhu and take up management affairs with him, as he has gone today to India to take over GBC affairs. Hope this finds your sankirtana party members in good spirits by careful following of all regulative principles.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
