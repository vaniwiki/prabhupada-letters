My dear Hrdayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 2nd July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. You will be glad to know that I have consented to initiate your good wife, Elaine, as well as [name redacted], and have given them spiritual names Anangamanjari Devi and Radhaballaba Das, respectively; their beads and letters are enclosed herewith. So far as Radhaballaba getting himself married, you must first discuss with him that this marriage business is not a farce, but it must be taken very seriously. There is no question of divorce, and if he will promise not to separate from his wife, then my sanction for the marriage is there; otherwise not. Recently too many couples have been drifting into maya's waters, and it is very discouraging. So if he will agree on these points, then you can perform the marriage with my blessings.

Regarding lecturing at the university of Florida, if they will pay plane fare for two men there and back in addition to the sum they have agreed to give, then it will be my pleasure to go there. I require one assistant with me, so fare for two men, round trip, must be there; then I can go. By the middle of this month I am going to N.Y. so you can make plans accordingly.

Yes, I am very pleased that you are inclined to read and study our books with such seriousness. Thank you very much. And your conclusion is very nice. So continue it whole-heartedly. We want good preachers also. Preaching shouldn't depend on me only. My disciples should become all good preachers, and that depends on studying the books nicely so that you can arrive at the right conclusion. From your letter I can tell that you are doing very nicely in this regards and Krishna will help you in your endeavor more and more.

I have received also the $30.00 for beads and daksina. Thank you very much. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
