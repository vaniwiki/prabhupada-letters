My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I understand that you are preparing for my arrival for your Rathayatra. I am not sure of your Rathayatra date but I think it is at the end of June. However at this time I will be in Europe. I am to arrive in Rome on the 23rd, then on the 30th to Geneva, then June 6 to Paris. On June 15 I go to Koln where Hansadutta has arranged a lecture tour continuing in Heidelberg and Amsterdam through July 6. So it will not be possible for me to attend Rathayatra if you have scheduled it for June. I am immediately going to the US after Europe to attend Rathayatra in Chicago on July 6 and then Rathayatra in San Francisco on July 8. From there I will come to Australia toward the middle or end of July. If it is possible for you to reschedule your Rathayatra for the end of July then I will attend. But I will come to Australia at that time anyway. I do not know if you will be able to reschedule your Rathayatra. So if you wish to communicate with me I will be in the European cities as dated above.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
