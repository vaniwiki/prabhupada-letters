My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you so much for letter of November 30, 1968 and the glorious sentiments you have expressed therein. I am so glad to read that you are doing very well and keeping always engaged. This is the key to elevating in Krishna Consciousness that we always keep our thoughts, our words and our actions centered around our life and soul, this being Krishna. If we remember to practice this process then automatically all distresses and botherations will become nil. So I am very encouraged that all of you are progressing in learning this technique.

So far as the certificates are concerned, they are very beautiful and nicely done. But I have noticed that there is one small spelling mistake which you may be able to correct. "Srimati" you have spelled as "Srimate". Srimate is used for addressing someone, but Srimati is the title which is appropriate on the certificate. So if you can change this on all of the certificates it will be better.

Regarding your question about arati, no there is no special prayers to be said just in the morning. Also you have asked about the compiler of Sri Brahma Samhita and the four-headed Brahma of this universe is the compiler.

So thank you again for your letter and please convey my very hearty blessings to Malati also who has written one very nice letter which I have seen last week. I hope that this finds you all in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have received the newspaper cuttings for Prahlada %%__%%
