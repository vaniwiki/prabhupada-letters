My dear Duryodhanaguru das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 17, 1974 and have noted the contents. I want that someone learns how to make mrdangas in the Western countries. As far as I know Isana has not produced any mrdangas. So how will he teach your wife how to make them. First let him produce something, then he can teach others. I have no objection. If somehow or other someone can learn how to make good mrdangas in America, it will be a great service.

Please study my books very carefully and do not fail in chanting at least 16 rounds daily.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
