Los Angeles

My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. Since a very long time I have not received any word from you. I hope everything is going on well with you in our Los Angeles World Headquarters.

Please send me a report of your general activities in Los Angeles Temple and also your Governing Body Commission activities.

Please offer my blessings to all the members of our Temples. How is the Deity worship being carried on?

Awaiting your reply.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Also let me know if you are sending book collection fund to Dai Nippon regularly\\
