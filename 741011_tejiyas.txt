My dear Tejiyas das:

Please accept my blessings. One letter from Harikesa has been received regarding getting maintenance money. Gurudasa has all of a sudden left. How will the Vrindaban expenditure be met? Where is the money Gurudasa collected for the Deities? Where is it kept and what is the account? Yamuna is very clever, and I know they have collected huge sum.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Your letter to Brahmananda Swami dated Oct. 6, 1974 has just been received and I am glad to learn that things are improving. You just maintain Vrindaban, and your duty is finished.
