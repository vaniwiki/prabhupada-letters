Los Angeles

My dear Dayananda and Nandarani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of each of your letters dated December 27 and December 28, 1973, respectively, and I have noted the contents carefully.

I am in favor of whatever will push on this Krsna Consciousness movement throughout the world. So if you both wish to serve at Gurukula, if Karandhara and Satsvarupa and Mohanananda all agree then certainly you should go there. You have already proven your ability in this field by raising two nice Krsna Conscious children. So if you can help now to raise hundreds and thousands of children in Krsna Consciousness, that will be the greatest service to Krsna and certainly you shall both go back to home, back to Godhead, by doing this. But before any new service, be certain that your absence shall not cause any harm to our Los Angeles Temple. After all it is you who first worked so hard in the beginning and should see in the future how it would expand. So first speak with Karandhara and take his approval.

Gurukula is our most important project. If the children are given a Krsna Conscious education from early childhood then there is great hope for the future of the world. I have already given instruction on how the teaching should be conducted there, and this you can learn from Satsvarupa, Mohanananda, and the other senior teachers. Whatever service we do, our enthusiasm must always be kept strong. So Krsna is giving you guidance from within. So if you go to Gurukula, try to help develop things there and make it the model educational institution in the world.

Hoping this meets you both in good mood,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
