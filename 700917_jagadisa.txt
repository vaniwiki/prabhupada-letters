My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 6th, 1970, and have noted the contents. I am so glad to learn that your center is doing very nicely---distribution of "Back to Godhead" and other literatures is very encouraging and you are now 17 devotees strong there.

If you a have got sufficient devotees to take care of the Deities as you have seen how in the Los Angeles Temple, take instruction from Yamuna and Silavati how they are worshiping and the installation procedure is given on a separate sheet.

Regarding your invitation to take instruction from the University scholars, we are not concerned with a scholar who knows theoretically Caitanya Vaisnava Movement but we are interested with persons who are actually devotees who actually chant Hare Krsna Mahamantra and follows the regulative principles; Theoretical knowledge will not help us.

Yes, regarding Mr. Murthy, it is better for me if he comes to India and lives with me for some time.

Please offer my blessings to all the devotees and your good wife, Laksmimoni Dasi. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
