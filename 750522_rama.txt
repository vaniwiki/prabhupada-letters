My dear Rama dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note and daksina totalling $142 (New Zealand). Thank you very much for this presentation. Please try very hard to remain fixed-up in devotional service to Lord Krishna, always chanting Hare Krishna (at least 16 rounds), following the four rules, and reading my books frequently. Do not deviate from the path that I have chalked out for every one of you, and be happy in Krishna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
