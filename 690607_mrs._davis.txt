Dear Mrs. Davis,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 31, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Patita Uddharana was here two days ago, and I had a talk with him about the situation you have brought up in your letter. There will be no objection if you can come here to New Vrindaban. The whole thing has been explained to your son, Patita Uddharana, so you may consult with him and do the needful.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
