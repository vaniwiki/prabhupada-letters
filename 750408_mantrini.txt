My dear Mantrini dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 26th, 1975 and have noted the contents. In order to start the proposed project in your letter you must have full sanction of the GBC. Then I will approve of it, if they approve it. Do not try to start any project independent of the GBC. I want that everyone will co-operate nicely with the GBC. Please follow all of the rules and regulations very carefully and chant at least 16 rounds daily.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
