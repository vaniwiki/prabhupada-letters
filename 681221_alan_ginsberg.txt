My dear Mr. Ginsberg,

Please accept my blessings. I was much aggrieved to hear the news of your accident and I was very anxious to learn that you are lying now in the hospital. I hope that you are progressing nicely but in any condition I request that you continue to chant the Maha Mantra, Hare Krishna. Here is a chance for you to chant Hare Krishna exclusively in the hospital bed.

This world is full of dangers in every step. Just like in the ocean there is danger in every step but if we take shelter of boat which is known as the Lotus Feet of Lord Krishna, then this great ocean of danger becomes as harmless as a small pit. We shall be able to cross hundreds of such pits simply by chanting the Holy Names of the Lord, the Hare Krishna Mantra.

I am forwarding this letter through Rupanuga and I shall be glad to hear about your improved health from him. Praying to Krishna for your early recovery. Do not be worried. Krishna will save you from all dangers. Chant sincerely.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
