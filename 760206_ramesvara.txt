====== Letter to: Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated January 27, 1976 and have carefully noted the contents. Regarding the Nectar of Instruction, why not distribute it to the common men? Every book is meant for everyone, but especially for the devotees. Please try to print a large number so that it can be distributed just like Sri Isopanisad.

Regarding __Krsna Consciousness is Authorized,__ the first thing you should do is arrange to have a few thousand sent to India immediately. They can be sent to the Calcutta temple but addressed to me. I am organizing an office of book distribution under my direct supervision, and I shall post these books to officers, professors, lawyers, etc. I think that the mass mailings of this book can be done by the BBT Mailorder department and BBT can cover the whole cost. But because we will be distributing it freely for the most part, you should try to get the cost reduced as far as possible. You can try to get a good response from your mailings, but regardless of the response, we should distribute this book indiscriminately to selected persons as I have already indicated: renown business, medical men, government officials, scientists etc. Your new membership publication should be included with the __Krsna Consciousness is Authorized__ in any mass mailing.

Regarding the money for Bombay, you may send it by the first week of each month. There is no need to ask Gopala Krsna. Following each transfer of money, please send a xerox copy of the transfer slip to me.

Hoping this finds you well,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
