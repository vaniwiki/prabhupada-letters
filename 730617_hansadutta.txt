My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 13, 1973 accompanied by two copies of German BTG #19.

The magazine is gorgeous, better than Dia Nippon. Continue the standard, increase the pages, increase the articles, increase the distribution. May Krsna bless you more and more. Offer my blessings to your wife.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
