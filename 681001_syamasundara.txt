My dear Syamasundara

Please accept my blessings. I am so pleased to learn about your slow but sure progress in the matter of your most glorious London yatra. I am sure Krishna will help you fully and do it seriously. I hope the letter of Alan Ginsberg will help you greatly. If you think so right you can open a/c external sterling scheme with the %%_____%% London and let me know the a/c number. Hope this will find you in good health. Offer my blessings to Gurudasa Yamuna, Janaki & Malati. ACB\\
* but if need be you may not do it immediately but do it when I shall go there.\\
P.S. Yamuna has sent me a copy of letter you have received from Alan Ginsberg. Please utilize this letter properly. I am sure this will help you greatly.
