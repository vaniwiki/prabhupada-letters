====== Letter to: Manasvi ======

Honolulu

My dear Manasvi das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Feb. 28th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to hear that things are going nicely there. Our Honolulu center is very nice. Give Siddhasvarupa Maharaja nice facilities for preaching. He can attract many people by his preaching. Regarding the shortage of men that you mentioned, I have spoken to Kirtanananda Svami and asked him to try and arrange for more men to come. And regarding the cows on the farm, try to make some ghee also. That will be very valuable.

I have accepted the persons whom you have recommended for 1st initiation. Their names are: Linda---Lilasravana, Kathryn---Kamini, Cynthia---sita, Joe---Yasodala, Ronald---Ranganatha. Their beads can be chanted by Kirtanananda Svami. Also I have accepted Laksmana dasa for 2nd initiation. His thread and mantra sheet is enclosed herein. Let him hear the tape of myself chanting the gayatri mantra in his right ear. Keep the standard of devotional service very strict there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
