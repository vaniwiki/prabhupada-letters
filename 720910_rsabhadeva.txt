Berkeley

My dear Rsabhadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Berkeley, dated August 28, 1972, and I thank you very much for your kind sentiments. I am very happy to hear that you have got a son for dedicating for Lord Caitanya's Sankirtana movement. Yes, his name of Gauranga das is very nice and I have no objection for calling him like that. Now we are at the Dallas school and it is very nice place and just suitable for educating your son here when he becomes old enough, at least four or five years old. Now give him all facilities to become conscious of Krsna from very birth, and this will be the greatest service for Krsna if you can deliver Him one pure devotee.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
