My dear Shakti Mati devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17/9/74 in Hindi language and I have noted the contents. I thank you for your concern for my well being. Actually I was very ill. I was falling down. But, by your prayers Krishna has kindly made me recover. Because you have prayed to Krishna therefore I have recovered. Just like Srimat Kunti devi when there was difficulty, she prayed to Krishna. That is Krishna consciousness. Not that when there is difficulty I shall forget Krishna. Whatever the material condition may be we should just cling to Krishna's lotus feet.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
