My dear Uddhava

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 17, 1968, and I have noted the contents carefully.

From your letter it is clear that as of yet you have no idea of how much the price will be to print our books. This is a very important factor and I think that now that Vaikunthanatha and Patita Uddharana are in NY to help you you should utilize their labor to arrive at some figure. As you know, Dai Nippon is printing our books for a price of approximately $1.20 per book with shipping paid so I do not know if our own press will be able to compete with such price. I there is good milk available plentifully in the market place there is no need to keep a cow. So similarly, if we can get our books printed and cheaply and with no trouble of labor then it is an adequate arrangement. From the beginning Advaita and yourself have been very sincere and enthusiastic about this project but now I think we must be very businesslike in investigating the price which will be required to print our books. So immediately you should look seriously into this question and inform me of your findings as you are able.

I am so happy that you are looking to your marriage with Lilasukha and she also is happy with this arrangement. On Christmas day, Hayagriva and Syama Dasi are to be married in LA and this is very encouraging because we will welcome the arrival of nice KC children to carry on this movement for which we are laying ground.

Please convey my blessings to the others and I hope that you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
ACB

NB: Please convey my thanks to Patita Uddharana for his nice letter. I will be looking forward to seeing the epic poem which he promised to be sending me soon.\\
P.S. I have asked Hayagriva to invest some money in purchasing press and he has almost agreed. Apart from labor and other cost you can give me an estimate of price of the materials required.
