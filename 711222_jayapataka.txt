Calcutta

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated December 6, 1971, and 11, Narayana, 485, and I am pleased that you are enthusiastic to deal with all matters of Calcutta Temple with serious view. I have sent Bhavananda there to help you, and you can assist him to organize everything very nicely. I want that we shall hold a grand festival in Mayapur from middle of February to first March, so you may conjointly organize how to raise the money and build cottages and pandal in Mayapur. Acyutananda is coming there also and he has given advance money, so because they are pressing, he must go there to Mayapur and settle up this transaction.

I am suspicious that the robbery in Mayapur might have been done by some enemies. Maybe these land-sellers are also in the gunda class. But if we have there 5 to 10 men, these things will not happen. If you want to keep gun, I have no objection. But first you inform the police, etc.

Now the war is finished I don't think you will have difficulty to enter Nadia.

I want that our temples in India supply me with two life-members daily, that's all. Then I shall take care of all other programs, you needn't worry about that. Just get me two life-members a day in all of India, the rest I shall decide.

If you like you can take Indian citizenship---at least some of our men who have been here after two years may take Indian citizenship. Some of our men from abroad must be in charge and remain here seriously.

I have just now received your letter of 15, Narayana, 485, and I am very much encouraged by your attitude of service. I have no objection if Aravinda stays in my room for a few days more before returning to USA. Of course, it is not proper formal etiquette, but if he is insisting, what can be done? I have instructed that he should take that ticket of Mani Bande and go. About the treasurer post, that must be decided between you and Tamala and Bhavananda.

I have just noted that the Maharashtran Government is lifting the prohibition of liquor in this state, because they cannot prevent people from taking illegal liquor and sometimes killing themselves because it is bad quality, and also they lose so much tax money. So it is very clear that simply by prohibiting something will not mean the people will stop. If you tell a thief not to steal, despite all sorts of warnings, he will continue to steal. Therefore, the best way is not to prohibit by laws but to cleanse the heart. That is the real prevention of sinful activity.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
