Dear Tusta Krsna Maharaj,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 19, and have heard the contents.

Certainly we are opposed to abortion, and we can advise that it is not good, but do not take an active part in this political agitation against abortion. We are not much concerned in that way, so do not waste time approaching politicians or affiliating with others on the basis of the anti-abortion issue. We are Krsna Conscious and we are for Krsna Consciousness; that is our issue. Abortion is only a side issue. Whatever you have done that is all right, but concentrate now on our main business to make everyone Krsna Conscious. Our method is simple as taught by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: chant Hare Krishna and distribute prasadam. And if we find someone who is a little educated, try to distribute a book to him, and with the profit we can maintain.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
