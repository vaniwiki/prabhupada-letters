====== Letter to: Sama ======

Baltimore

My dear Sama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 25, 1973.

Thank you very much for sincerely pushing on Lord Caitanya's Sankirtana Movement in the city of Baltimore. Try to always increase the distribution of my books more and more. This is our most important program for reaching the lost souls of Kali Yuga. We have to educate men about the absolute truth. All of the scientists and other big men are simply cheating the mass of men by making false propaganda in order to take some money from them. We must expose these rascals by strong preaching and profuse distribution of these Krsna Conscious literatures.

I am pleased to accept Bhaktin Pattie as my initiated disciple and am enclosing a separate letter for her. Now hold a fire yajna and send her beads to Rupanuga das Goswami for chanting on.

Hoping this finds you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
