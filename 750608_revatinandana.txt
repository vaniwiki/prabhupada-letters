My dear Revatinandana Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 29, 1975 and have noted the contents. Yes preach as much as possible. Preaching is our life. Travel, here and there, holding kirtana, distributing prasadam and books and speak our philosophy very nicely. I have accepted Doc and Shari for 1st initiation and their names are as follows: Dharmadhyaksa dasa and Sri Radha devi dasi. Make sure that they continue to follow the principles, chant 16 rounds and read studiously and their spiritual advancement will be guaranteed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
