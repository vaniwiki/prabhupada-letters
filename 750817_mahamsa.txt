Hyderabad

My dear Mahamsa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 2, 1975 and have noted the contents carefully. The photographs show that the Nellore land is very nice and that a nice center can be constructed there. Yes, you did the right thing in getting the Gift Deed registered. I am sending herewith the Power of Attorney in this connection that you have asked for. Gopala Krishna informed me that you plan to build the temple in Nellore with the help of local life members. This is a very good idea. You may construct a library and a meditation hall to please the donors, but as far as possible the library should carry our books and books of other Vaisnava acaryas. The meditation hall you may put pictures of Krishna on all four sides. The construction may start as soon as you have raised enough money to local help. If the climate there is nice, then I may also come there.

Regarding the Hyderabad construction, it should not be stopped. I have received your request for the additional Rs. 40,000/- that I have agreed to give you, and this is all right. %%___%% you a loan you have requested for Rs. 60,000/-, but one thing is that it must be paid back. So many loans are given and they do not pay back. Please send me in writing that you agree to repay as soon as possible. Regarding the farm, we should not invest any money until it is transferred into our name.

If we are offered land in the future, you can consult with me or Gopala Krishna before accepting it. I would like to have a temple in every village in India and invite everyone to come and eat prasada, and live with us provided they follow our principles. The only problem is that we do not have enough devotees to manage so many centers. But, if you can make local devotees who have management ability, then you may accept as many plots of land as are offered.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
