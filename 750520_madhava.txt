My dear Madhava dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. You go to those rascals and they will convert you. You are not so strong that you can convince them and convert them from their foolishness. It is distinctly said in the Bhagavad-gita that the purpose of Vedic knowledge is to understand Krishna, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo, [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]]. So, we are presenting Krishna in so many ways, politically, socially, economically, philosophically, and religiously, etc. We are describing Him in 75 books of 400 pages each. Better read these books thoroughly and be firmly convinced yourself before going to these demons for convincing them. if you are weak yourself, while trying to convert them, you will be converted by them. Don't try any hard task before you are very strong. Chant 16 rounds daily, follow the rules and regulations, and read our books. Don't become very big preacher immediately.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
