My dear Sudhindra Kisora Roy,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 21-4-75 and have noted the contents. Please continue to visit our temple in Calcutta as often as possible. I cannot very well understand what your letter says due to typing errors and spelling and grammar. But even if there may be some problems, always try to remain in Krishna Consciousness. Do not give up chanting the Hare Krishna mantra simply due to some external difficulties. Under all circumstance you should always chant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. This will protect you from all danger of being influenced by Maya or the material energy.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
