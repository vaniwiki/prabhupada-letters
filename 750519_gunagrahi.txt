My dear Gunagrahi dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 8th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for doing such nice preaching work there. Train our men to follow all of the rules and regulations very carefully, as well as to chant at least 16 good rounds daily and to read all of our books.

Regarding the festival on July 6th, the best thing is to simply hold big kirtana and have plenty of prasadam distributed. Generally, the public masses are not so much interested in hearing philosophy. After five or ten minutes, their attention is lost. You can speak a little philosophy, but the stress should be on kirtana and prasadam and selling my books.

I accept Sharon Swanson for 1st initiation. Her name is Sandamini. Her beads may be chanted on by Satsvarupa Maharaja. Also I have accepted Sajjane Jivana for 2nd initiation. Let her hear the gayatri tape (of myself chanting) through the right ear. Her mantra sheet is enclosed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
