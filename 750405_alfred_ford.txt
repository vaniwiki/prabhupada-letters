My dear Alfred,

Please accept my blessings. Gurukrpa Svami has referred your latter dated March 12th, 1975 to me for final approval. I think your idea is very good. You are giving your forefather's hard-earned money and I don't want to see it spoiled in any way. In a year or so you can turn the property over to: A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. You are sincerely trying to please Krishna, and therefore He is giving you all intelligence---how to do it.

After the opening of our Vrndavana temple here in India, I shall start for Australia by May 5th to install Gaura-Nitai deities and then I shall go to Fiji for a few days to see how our center is doing there. After that, I shall arrive in Honolulu by May 17th. This time, I will stay there for some time, most probably until the beginning of July, when I will be going to the American mainland for our annual Rathayatra festival in San Francisco. If it is convenient for you, I would like to have you come and stay with me while I am there in Hawaii. I will arrange a nice room for you and any other facilities you may require. I am hoping that you will consider this carefully to my Bombay address.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
