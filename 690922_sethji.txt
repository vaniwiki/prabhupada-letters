My dear Sethji,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th August, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. The boy, Sri Arun Kumar, wherever he goes in our centers, he will be welcome. All our centers are accustomed to taking Prasadam, so it will be very nice if he lives with us. Just now we have no center in Pittsburgh, although we have opened a branch in Philadelphia at 4524 Regent Street, Phila., Pa. 19143. Our Tokyo branch is not yet opened, but our men are working there, and as soon as they find a suitable house, we shall regularly establish the center. In the meantime, we have established some new centers in Washington, Detroit, Colorado, and Laguna Beach. Perhaps you have seen in __The Times of India__ and other papers about my London arrival. On the reverse side you will find one of the articles from __The Sun,__ published in London. We have released one Hare Krishna record through the famous record manufacturers, the Apple Company, and by the Grace of Krishna it is being sold on the average 20,000 copies per week in London alone. So the Hare Krishna Movement is gradually becoming very popular in the Western countries. It is great necessity to construct a very big Radha-Krishna temple here, so I am trying to find out some redundant churches to turn into temples. Please pray to Lord Caitanya to help me in this great attempt. You are a great devotee of Lord Caitanya and your prayers will be heard by Him.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Sincerely,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
