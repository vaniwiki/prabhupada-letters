====== Letter to: Malati ======

My dear Malati,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 11 Sept. 1968. And I am so pleased to hear of your Kirtana in Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park Corner, and at the Hindu Center. This is giving me so much pleasure to hear how nicely you are carrying on this movement in London. It was originally my Guru Maharaja's desire that there should be a center established in London, and by His Mercy, now you have successfully begun this mission; so please keep me informed how you are progressing there. I am very anxious to hear in each letter. I hope you are well, and convey my blessings to your good husband and little child, Miss Sarasvati devi.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
