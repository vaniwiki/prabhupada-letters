My dear Bali Mardan das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 13, 1974 together with the copy of S.B. 3:4, color photos and slides hand delivered by Gopala Krishna. The book is nice. The printing, binding is nice, but the paper is a little inferior, especially the end paper. It is good that you are getting it done quicker. The slides and photos of the Deities are also nice, and I can see that the programs are going on nicely.

Now there is one matter for your urgent attention. Gurudasa has suddenly left India. So when you were there recently you mentioned how you were liking to remain in Vrindaban with your wife for some time. So I may request to go immediately to Vrindaban together with your wife. Then from here we can go to Japan together, and if we get the Gaurange Hall, we can go to New York.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
