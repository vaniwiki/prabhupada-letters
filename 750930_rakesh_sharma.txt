My dear Rakesh Sharma:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 19, 1975 and have noted the contents. You are born in brahmana family, so your forefather's blood is there, and now you are thinking like a brahmana. So it is all Krishna's grace. You have already given up meat eating, etc., and if possible you can live in our temple and execute devotional service. This will save your life in Krishna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
