My dear Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated June 26, 1972, and July 4, 1972, and I have noted the contents very carefully. Now my advice is this, that you take your family to San Francisco and become the President there, because Kesava wants to change, and I think he has liked it in London very much, so he may come here immediately while I am here and help me to get one very nice temple here. What do you think of this proposal?

Yes, reading my books will help you, philosophy must be there, but if you do not also apply the philosophy by participating in all temple affairs like rising early, attending mangal arati, performing devotional service, then simply learning the philosophy will have no effect. Therefore, my suggestion is that you should take charge of the San Francisco affairs, which are already in good order, and live nicely with your family in Krishna Consciousness, because you have got tendency to manage and also good experience and ability.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
