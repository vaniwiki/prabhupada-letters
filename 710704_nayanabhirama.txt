Philadelphia

My dear Nayana Bhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 1st July, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear how nicely you performed Rathayatra festival. Next year you can perform the regular ceremony with a cart, as we are doing in San Francisco and London. That will be very nice. It doesn't matter if you construct a small cart, but you can hold such a festival.

So far your leaving Philadelphia center, that is not advisable at the present moment. Better to wait until Philadelphia temple is very firmly established and then if you wish you can go to Morocco to open a center. Whatever center you open, it must be well organized. There is no use to open a center if the management is not proper. So far as learning the film industry, that is out of the question. Krishna industry is good engagement for us.

Very soon, by the middle of this month, I will be going to N.Y., and if you like, then you can come and see me at that time and we can discuss further on these points.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
