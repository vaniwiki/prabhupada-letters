My dear Krishna Devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your short note regarding your marriage. So far I know that you are married with Subala das before me and as such you forget all your previous life. You are now liberated from all other obligations because you surrendered yourself unto Krishna. Such surrender has no more obligations to anyone. So far Subala is concerned he is also a surrendered soul and thus your combination is quiet apt for the service of the Lord. You have, by the Grace of Krishna, got a very nice place to develop a full fledged temple and your husband is becoming competent to conduct the service nicely. I have already given him instruction how to do things and that is published in the New Mexican paper. Please do follow the instructions both husband and wife, and help your God brothers and sisters to follow the instructions faithfully. Krishna is always with you provided you are sincere in His service and faithful to your Spiritual Master, that is the secret success. It is plain and simple, please try to be faithful and sincere. You are very intelligent and devotee of the Lord. Please know it that I do not approve anyone's separation who are married by me. If they disagree, they may live separately, but there cannot be divorce. When one is separate, one may fully devote in Krishna, but no more marriage. If this is not followed, I will not take part in anyone's marriage in the future. I hope you will understand me right and do the needful. Hope you are well.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
