My dear Nityananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated December 11, 1973. Yes, I received the photo album and it was very nice. Thank you very much.

I hereby accept the two devotees you recommended for second initiation and enclosed find two sacred threads and two gayatri mantras.

Take instruction from Satsvarupa Goswami on how to properly perform the fire yajna after which the initiates may listen once to the mantra in the right ear from the cassette tape I have made.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
