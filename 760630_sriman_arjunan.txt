My dear Sriman Arjunan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and have noted the contents with care.

You can come and meet me personally in New York. We shall talk. I will be in New York from July 9th-July 20th, 1976. You can come and stay with me between these dates and when you come we can clear up the whole matter.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
