====== Letter to: Madhudvisa ======

My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 20th, 1973, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very glad to note your Sankirtana enthusiasm. These Volkswagen buses are very nice. This is real Sankirtana preaching. Regarding Hong Kong, I think the Sankirtana can be organized there also. Please try to organize it. Your reply to the Hindus regarding another Swami speaking in our Krishna Consciousness Temple is nice. We cannot compromise to satisfy others. The neophyte preaching programme is very good, and this should be introduced in all our centers. Regarding the devotees getting sick, they are not accustomed to eating fatty foods. Therefore, I suggest boiled vegetable taking only little ghee and capati without any ghee.

Tusta Krishna Maharaja, Siddha Svarupananda Maharaja and Sudama Vipra Maharaja are good boys and if there are any difficulties, I shall rectify these on my return to Los Angeles via Hawaii.

Regarding the Lord Caitanya murti, it is not at all good and I do not approve. Lord Caitanya is stout and strong. There are so many pictures which you can follow. So have the artist start a new murti.

Regarding my coming there in December for opening the new Australian Headquarters, yes that will be possible if the opening ceremony can correspond with the celebration of the Disappearance Day of my Guru Maharaja on December 13rd, that will be auspicious.

I hope this meets you and all my beloved disciples in Australia well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
