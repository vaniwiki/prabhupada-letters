My dear Dininatha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am glad to learn that you are working very hard there and preaching Krsna consciousness amongst the Africans. If you are sincere and your motive is pure, then everything will come out all right and you will be successful. Regarding the incident with Nava Yogendra, now this can be forgotten and you go on with your work. We are not concerned for these things.

So I am coming there shortly and I will see how you are doing. I am glad to learn that one Moslem girl has joined. I do not know why there should be opposition from her community for wearing sari. In Bengal many Moslem women, they wear sari and there is no objection. Similarly, in other parts of India Moslem women, they wear sari and there is no objection. The fact that the Moslems are saying Hare Krsna to you on the street, that is your success. We do not care for Moslem, Christian, this or that. We see everyone as part and parcel of Krsna, and as such they should re-establish their loving relationship with Krsna. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
