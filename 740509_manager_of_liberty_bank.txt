The Manager\\
Liberty Bank, Main Branch\\
Honolulu

Dear Sir,

This is to introduce Mr. Brent Selden, who is the president of the Honolulu branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. I am authorizing him to make a withdrawal from account no. 35785 in the amount of $5000.00. I have mailed him a withdrawal slip for this purpose.

Kindly oblige. Thanking you in anticipation.

Yours sincerely,\\
