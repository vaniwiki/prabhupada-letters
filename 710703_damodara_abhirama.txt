My dear Damodara and Abhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 27th June, 1971 and have noted the contents. Yes, it will be a great event if you can arrange a meeting with President Nixon. If Mr. Nixon keeps a cool head and tries to understand our movement, it will be good for us and the whole world also. Actually the whole world is suffering for want of Krishna Consciousness, that is a fact. So there is great turmoil everywhere. If Nixon will help us a little, we can do the work with great enthusiasm and facility. Unfortunately the politicians do not want to see people in higher consciousness. They want to keep the people in darkness and exploit their sentiment for personal aggrandizement. They pose to be the friend of the people, but they are actually not. The real friend is Krishna. Still, if you can make arrangements to meet with Nixon, it will be a great event, so try for it very seriously.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
