My dear Mrs. Singhal;

I thank you very much for your letter dated August 31st. Please accept my blessings. By the grace of Lord Nrsimhadeva my health is improving. I have informed Giriraja das that when he completes my quarters I will surely come to Bombay, and look forward to seeing you then.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
