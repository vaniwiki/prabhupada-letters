My dear Nandarani,

I am very glad to receive your recent letter. I am also glad to inform you that I am improving my health by the Grace of Krishna. I don't believe in medicine or doctors, but I am practically perceiving that the massaging is helping me beyond expectation. Today I have taken a shower bath by myself, and I am reciting from Srimad Bhagavatam, and am enjoying the seashore here in N. J. I believe that within a fortnight I shall recoup my health sufficiently and be able to start for San Francisco and meet you all there.

I am also glad to learn that you have a child within your womb, and please accept all my blessings for the newcomer for whom we shall be very glad to receive just after a few months. Please take care of your health so that the child may grow very healthy and become Krishna Conscious. Prahlada Maharaja was in the womb of his mother and heard the instruction of Narada Muni and later on he became the most famous devotee of Lord Krishna. It is the duty of all parents to make every child Krishna Conscious, so that the fortunate child born of Krishna Conscious parents may not have any more to take birth in this material world.

Thank you for the very fine leaf.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
