Toronto

My dear Uttama Sloka,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 18th. Thank you for your report of the Toronto activities. Regarding the initiations, I think that everyone has been initiated in New Vrndavana recently.

Regarding women worshiping the deity, in the Bhagavad-gita it is stated __striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te'pi yanti param gatim.__ The idea is that everyone who is properly initiated and following the rules and regulations can worship the deity.

I hope this letter meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
