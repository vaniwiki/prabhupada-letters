Stockholm

My dear Ajita dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Oct. 1, 1975 and I have noted the contents carefully. If you see problems in the Stockholm center why don't you try to reform it by your example and practical application of our philosophy. If I have to be involved in every dispute, then what is the need for the GBC? GBC is there for this purpose. However, if there is some serious difficulties, just now I can not give decision. If it is not settled, then it can be discussed at Mayapur.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
