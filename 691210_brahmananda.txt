====== Letter to: Brahmananda ======

My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated December 4, 1969 and December 6, 1969. So far as transferring $1,400 to the account of ISKCON, I have done it immediately. The copy of the advice to the bank is enclosed. Please note down my account number there which is now transferred to the same branch on Broadway. So when convenient you also transfer in the same way so there will be no difficulty of exchanging money. Regarding the Franklin and Marshall College, as you have desired that it is a wonderful opportunity for me, so that I may be able to write in seclusion while my elderly students may manage the society affairs, that is a very welcome suggestion. So you can accept the proposal immediately. Besides that, I see that Professor Thomas J. Hopkins and the students of the college are very much eager to hear from me, so I must fulfill their eager desire, even there is some inconvenience. But I hope if I get a nice apartment with heating arrangement, there will be no inconvenience. I am also pleased to note that they are going to purchase my books, 30-35 sets. That is a great boon for us. If we can introduce our books in these colleges and universities, it will be great prestige for the society and myself also personally. So let us do this business as an experiment.

Another thing, I have received a great complaint against the United Shipping Corporation regarding supplying goods to our Hawaii branch. So pending inquiry, you should not forward any order to them, and if you have got any money due from them, you should try to adjust by taking goods from them immediately. Regarding __BTG,__ I am so glad that you are printing 50,000 copies henceforward. I have received also your press management report, so the only thing to be amended there is that all books especially must be twiced edited, once by Satsvarupa and once by Hayagriva. In every publication house all printing matters are edited at least three times. So we should be very much careful about grammatical and printing mistakes. That will mar the prestige of the press and the institution.

In your previous letter you told me that Mr. C.L. Jaipuria visited our temple and he paid $10 as contribution and you also presented him with one __TLC.__ Since then, did you write any letter to this gentleman? I know this gentleman has a charitable disposition of mind, and he can help us in so many ways. Try to keep in touch with him by sending magazines and writing letters. He may be able to supply us many things from India, especially Deities.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
