My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. Sriman Bhagavan das is mailing out one newsletter of our activities to the Indian families in U.S.A. to gain their support, especially in Chicago. I have seen one copy and it is very nice, so I have asked that he send a copy to each and every one of our life members here in India as frequently as they are printed up. It will enhance their prestige locally as well as that of the society as a whole. In this regards you can immediately send Bhagavan das an up-to-date list of all life members in Calcutta. A complete list of all Bombay life members, etc. has already been sent.

I have asked Jayapataka to immediately dispatch 25 pairs japa mala @Rs 1/25 of the style I previously described. There has been no reply and there is need of these beads. I do not know if he has received my letter, but you can relate this message and he should act immediately.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have just received your letter of 13/4/71.\\
