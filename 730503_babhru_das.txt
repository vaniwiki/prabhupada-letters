My dear Babhru Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 5,1,73 and have received the dakshina contents contained therein. I am very grateful for your offering of $100 for your second initiation.

Now that you have become Brahmin you should know that this means increased responsibility on Krsna's behalf. Factually this is the important initiation so you please maintain a very high standard of Krsna Consciousness and be very serious to execute the instructions of the spiritual master and Krsna.

I have also noted that you are going to spread this mission of Lord Chaitanya to South America and factually this is our last unconquered continent and I think there is great potential there. I am very much encouraged to know that it will now be developed under qualified disciples as yourself. so my request is that your work very hard there to give all the opportunity for this perfection, and I am sure Krsna will bestow His causeless mercy upon you.

I hope that this meets you in the best of health.

Your ever well wisher;

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
