My dear Gunagrahi Das Brahmacari,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice letter dated 27th December, 1970, and I am so glad to know that you have been staying at our Buffalo Temple and you are now the Sankirtana leader there. This is very good news. The spreading of this Sankirtana Movement is the best service to the greater humanity and all living entities in general because it revives the divine nature of the soul in Krsna Consciousness. So your activities are now supposed to be on the pure spiritual platform and by continuation of this simple process faithfully you will increase your spiritual blissful strength and influence those who come in your contact to take part in this joyous revival of love of Krsna, the desired life of eternally liberated souls.

I am very glad to accept you as my initiated disciple and your spiritual name is Gunagrahi Das Brahmacari. Gunagrahi means one who picks up or acquires all good qualifications or qualities. You can easily understand how Krsna is the repository of all auspicious qualities beyond enumeration; so you are to be known as the servant of the All-Good Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna. I have duly chanted your beads and they are returned to you herewith. Please fulfill your all requirements of advancement in Krsna consciousness by rigidly following the rules and regulations, chanting the sixteen rounds of beads daily, studying our literatures carefully and thoughtfully in the company of other devotees and try always to keep yourself engaged progressively in some kind of service of the Lord. I am sure that you are already well familiar with the requirements of devotional service and in any case they are fully elaborated in our various literatures like Nectar of Devotion. So you kindly become conversant with these transcendental scientific principles try to teach them to others while practicing them yourself. When you chant, avoid very carefully the ten offenses to the Holy Name. If you have any doubts or questions be sure to clear them by inquiry from either Rupanuga Prabhu, your other Godbrothers or if need be by writing to me. Be blessed and happy chanting Hare Krsna.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
