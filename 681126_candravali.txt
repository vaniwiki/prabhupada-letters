====== Letter to: Candravali ======

My dear Candrabali,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of November 23 and have noted the contents carefully.

Your plan of translating the three volumes of Srimad-Bhagavatam is a great encouragement to me. We require that men of all tongues may know of the great message of Krishna and your rendering our books in the Spanish language will be a tremendous service to our Krishna Conscious movement. It is most encouraging news that you have begun this activity and by all means continue with it. If you will complete the first three volumes by June, 1969, as you have proposed, it shall be a most welcome asset for propagation of our society. Also, your carving and painting Lord Jagannatha deities is very nice, we shall require such deities in all of our temples.

Regarding your opening a center in Mexico, I think that if some other brahmacarinis are available to go along with you that there will be no objection to this idea. However, where shall these brahmacarinis come from? For the time being, I think you may concentrate upon improving the temple already established in San Francisco as you have described that this temple is already short-handed. So kindly continue to work sincerely in developing your Krishna Consciousness and please keep me informed as to the progress of your translating work.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
