My dear Pradyumna dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter undated. I think you should stay. Your presence is required. If you are leaving because of your wife, then your wife must agree to pay for your return fare. If she agrees, then you can go.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
