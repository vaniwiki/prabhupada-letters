Dear Deoji Punja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 7, 1974 forwarded to me from USA. So I thank you very much for your sympathy. I have written to Subaladas Swami to accept your invitation, and I understand that you are arranging for his tickets. So please keep me informed of the progress there. Hare Krishna.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
