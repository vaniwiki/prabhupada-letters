My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to inform you that I am leaving Los Angeles on the 7th July. I am taking three Sannyasis on world tour. We shall reach to Hawaii first and I shall let you know then definitely what our plans are for coming to Tokyo so you will know when to expect our arrival.

I hope everything is going on well with you. Your reports from Japan are very encouraging, so I am looking forward to seeing you there.

Please offer my blessings to all Prabhus there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. If you have already arranged for my apartment then you can send me telegram immediately & I shall cancel Hawaii program.\\
