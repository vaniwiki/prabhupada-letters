My dear Bhavananda Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed are some photographs of a lake here where I take morning walk. Now I want that our lake in Mayapur should be like this. You can make the stone stairway on four sides, one at each end and one at the middle of each side.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
