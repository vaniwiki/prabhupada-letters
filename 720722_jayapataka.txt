My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 10, 1972, and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. I am very glad to hear that the building work is going on with full speed, including both day and night shifts of workers. Do not worry, I am sending you two first-class men from England, both of them have got good experience in engineering and building work. They are named Smarahari das and %%___%%. They shall be arriving very soon in India, and you can train them to help you there full-time. Besides, you may ask Giriraja if Saurabha das can come from Bombay from time to time to assist you there and see how the things are going on. He is experienced man.

Regarding Gitar Gan, do it conveniently. Regarding Lalita Prasad Thakura, as I have advised Acyutananda above, unless he keeps his promise than we are not interested to publish any of Bhaktivinode Thakura's books. That animosity against Guru Maharaja is going on, so we shall have nothing to do with it.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
