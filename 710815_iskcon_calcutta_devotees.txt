My dear Subaladas Swami, Madhudvisa Swami, Jayapataka Swami, Devananda Swami, Acyutananda Swami, Gargamuni Swami, Bali Mardan, Tamala Krishna, Madri devi, Gurudasa, Yamuna, Elliot, Lala Ram, Dravida, John Griesser, Yasodanandana, Pusta Krishna, Bhanu, Amrtananda, Dinanath, John, Citralekha, Giriraja, etc.

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your kind feelings of appreciation of my humble service unto you. You are all helping me in pushing forward this mission of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, coming down by disciplic succession to my Guru Maharaja. So whatever you have spoken, it is simply due to them. I am simply the via media to receive them, on behalf of my Guru Maharaja, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami Maharaja Prabhupada.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
