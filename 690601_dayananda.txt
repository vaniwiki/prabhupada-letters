Dear Dayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated May 25, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. If a new temple site in Los Angeles is absolutely required to be moved in a bigger place, that should be your first business. For my place you may find a place near the temple, and it should be independent of any other tenants. It may be a small cottage, but it should be independent with a little compound surrounding. That will be very nice. I think there are many small cottages near the place, Hayworth Avenue. When I was walking on Oakwood Avenue there were many places there. I remember one at the junction of Oakwood and Harper. So this place, or a similar independent place, never mind how small, will be very convenient for me. I have already written to Tamala Krishna that if I am not invited to London during the month of June, then sometimes in July early I shall go to San Francisco to see the Rathayatra Festival there, and then I will come down to Los Angeles. But I have decided that I shall spend four months in New Vrindaban and eight months in Los Angeles. That will be my regular program.

Please convey my blessings to your good wife, Nandarani, and your nice little daughter, Candramukhi. I hope this will meet you all in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
