My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. The books in India should not be sent to U.S.A. The contract for distributing our books was a pseudo contract, so it was cancelled. So the books must be distributed in India. There is no use in sending the books back here. So you must distribute these books, and so life membership distribution program must be vigorously done.

In L.A. they have not yet received the 24" brass Deities. How is that? Jayapataka Swami told me that they were taken to the shipping godown, but what happened next? Please clear up this matter immediately.

As of yet, I have not heard from you concerning our Mayapur program. Is the fence being constructed? What news of Indira Gandhi? Please let me know. I am very anxious to hear from you in this connection.

One more thing is that you can immediately dispatch 100 more sets of the beads gotten in Mayapur, and send them to London immediately. Just now in L.A. I have initiated 40 new devotees and so the beads are going quickly.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
