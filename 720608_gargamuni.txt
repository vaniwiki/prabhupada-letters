My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 6, 1972, and I have noted the contents. I shall be very glad to see the manuscripts which you are typing. You say that %%___%% early writings are very powerful and strong, so now it is not %%___%% I have become a little soft on account of my disciples. They %%___%% follow very strong orders.

I am glad to hear that you will be going to Gujarat state for about one month and that you are preparing one Gujarati BTG for distributing there. Tamala Krishna is doing very nicely by this traveling program in Bihar and Bengal. But one thing, why still insisting on this truck? Rather I have already explained, that in the interior preaching will not be suitable for you. Our business is in the big towns of India with the persons who speak in English language, so go town to town, and for that there is already the %%___%% arrangement of train, bus, like that. But I have given you the %%___%% in my previous letter to organize your party for traveling %%__%% out the suburbs of Bombay city for collecting. Bombay mean %%__%% So if you are anxious to collect large fund for our Vrindaban %%__%% Bombay construction work and distribute many literatures %%___%% think is to stick to Bombay city and outlying districts %%___%% Poona, Thana, and others.

But the best thing for attracting many people %%___%% in India will be the opulence in our Deity worship %%___%% should try to assist also in making sure that %%___%% ornately and gorgeously worshiped so that the %%___%% observe that our American and European Vaisnavas are passing all others in the sincerity and purity of their service to Lord Krishna.

Our business is to chant, so the time that Indian %%__%% to come to hear our chanting and arati and take prasada %%__%% that your preaching work is actually successful. For the %%__%% we should be satisfied with that. And if they become %%__%% that is very nice. The only difficulty is the Indians %%__%% we have to learn from the Americans? So the best thing is to %%__%% or other make them members and raise funds for our activities. When someone pays it means he is converted. Somehow or other %%__%% has to render some service, so if you can collect money from %%___%% that means practically they are becoming our disciples. So do not become spiritual depressed, actually these things are going forward very progressively there in India and I am very much thankful to you all my sincere disciples, especially the elder disciples and Sannyasis like your good self, for assisting me in this great mission of reviving the original Krishna Consciousness atmosphere in India. Do not worry, in time we shall be completely successful.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

n.b. Syamasundara has just shown me your letter %%____%% and I agree that these pandal programs or %%____%% very good opportunities for us, but we should %%____%% if somebody invites. If local men cooperate %%____%% all expenses, that will be nice, for example, at Kanpur. %%____%% held at Jaipur, the leading citizens raised money and %%____%% thing. But the Vrindaban Fund should not be touched at %%___%% time being, unless there is donation, a truck is not %%__%%.

I am just now in receipt of your letter dated 7th June, %%___%% (can understand that it is best thing for you to travel as %%___%% posing, and that is actually the duty of the Sannyasi, to %%___%% widely and preach. So you can go to Gujarat and other %%___%% Krishna is doing.
