My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am pleased to hear that the paintings for Vol. I Canto II have been finished and that more paintings for Vol. II have begun. At least from 50 to 100 paintings should appear in each volume, and that will be the perfection of your service for Lord Krsna. In reply to your specific question, there is no ocean of milk, rather they are standing on a normal ocean. I am always showing your paintings in Krsna Book to respectable Indian gentlemen and ladies and they are very much impressed that my American disciples have taken to this process with so much love and determination. Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
