My dear Dharmatma,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 28, 1976.

I'm very pleased that you are taking my order to distribute books so seriously. All blessings of Krishna are on these girls who are working so hard to distribute my books. that is very nice that you want to distribute more books than Tamala Krsna goswami's sankirtana party.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
