====== Letter to: Gurudasa ======

Vrindaban

My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated June 19 and June 30, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Ksirodakasayi Prabhu has delivered to me the Check Book no. PGL 971801 to PGL 971850, as well as the Pass Book for Vrindaban Building Fund account. The Check Book please find herewith. The Pass Book and a further letter will follow very soon, along with an advice to the Punjab National Bank written by Ksirodakasayi.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
