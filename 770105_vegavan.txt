My dear Vegavan,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 76/12/27 along with two copies of the Russian __Easy Journey to Other Planets.__ Thank you very much.

This is very, very good. I'm very pleased. It is another epoch making event. I'm sending one copy to the Russian embassy here and asking for their comment and opinion. The inclusion of my conversation with Professor Kotovsky is welcome.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
