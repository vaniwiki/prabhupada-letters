My dear Bhakta Ralph

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you letter, undated.

There is no reason why you cannot associate with any of my disciples, providing that they adhere to our principles. As long as Siddha Svarupa Maharaja and Tusta Krishna Maharaja act as sannyasis, ie. dress in dhoti, keep shave headed with sikha, follow strictly the rules and regulations and preach from my books, I have no objection. Sometimes there will be a little misunderstanding between Godbrothers, that is even going on amongst liberated souls. What is important is that everyone must engage in Krishna's service under the direction of the spiritual master.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
