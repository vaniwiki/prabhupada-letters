London

My dear Jaya Hari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25 June along with the wonderful literature, "Rathayatra '73, London Summer Festival." The collage of the pictures and the articles in the magazine have been wonderfully set up and I very much appreciate it. I can understand from your attempt that you are doing something wonderful this year. So I think I must accept your invitation. So far my health is concerned, by the Grace of Krsna I have improved very much, about 90%. In the meantime I received one telegram from Syamasundara: "Flying London Wednesday will Telex your tickets Thursday. BOAC Calcutta office." Therefore as soon as I get the tickets I shall try to reserve my seats and reach London as early as possible before 8 July. Thank you very much for your enthusiasm. Offer my beloved blessings for all devotees who have signed the invitation album. I shall enjoy their company when I meet them. I wish to visit the other branches in England. Invite all members of our European centers and make the ceremony very very successful by combined effort.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
