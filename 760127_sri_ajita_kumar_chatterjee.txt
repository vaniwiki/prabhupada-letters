====== Letter to: Sri Ajita Kumar Chatterjee ======

Sri Ajita Kumar Chatterjee\\
Calcutta

Dear Sri Chatterjeeji,

I beg to thank you for your letter dated January 23rd, 1976. Please come with your articles and see me at Mayapur, we shall discuss on the articles and if they are correct, then we shall publish them. It will be our great pleasure. But first I must see how they are written. We have got sufficient place so you can stay here and we shall read them together.

Your theme is O.K. There were many devotees of Lord Caitanya like Advaita Acarya, and even Lord Nityananda who were grhasthas. Lord Caitanya left His grhastha life. It is a matter of understanding Krishna---that is the real qualification. Whether one is grhastha or sannyasi, how well he knows Krishna. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung: "grhe va vanete thake, he gauranga bole dake". Lord Caitanya says

> kiba vipra, kibra nyasi, sudra kene nyaya,
> yei krishna tattva vetta, sei guru haya

So please come and we shall discuss your articles.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
