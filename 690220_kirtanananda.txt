====== Letter to: Kirtanananda ======

My dear Kirtanananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 18, 1969. I thank you very much for your inviting me to New Vrindaban, but, considering the local climate as presented by you I think I shall postpone it until the end of April. I am enclosing here reply to the letter of Hayagriva and Syama devi.

I hope this will meet you in very good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Is it possible to get your insurance money for clearing debts? Then why not show some debt & get the money.

I am thinking of going to Hawaii by the end of this month!
