My dear Daruka dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 3-16-75 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for the 150 dollar donation. If you follow my instructions very carefully as you promise in your letter, then your life will be perfect. I am not saying anything which is not given by my Guru Maharaja. I am simply repeating what I have learned from him. So you please do the same and your life will be full of ananda---blissful happiness, and you will be able to help spread this sankirtana movement all over the world.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
