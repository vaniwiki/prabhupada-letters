====== Letter to: Rayarama ======

My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. Just now I have received one letter from one of my God-brothers, whose name is as follows:

His Grace Y. Jagannatham, B.A.

81, Navrang, (8th Floor)

Peddar Road, Bombay-26

INDIA

He has heard about my activities and he is interested in all our literature. I shall be very glad if you send him all our Back To Godheads publications, as well as newspaper clippings at your earliest convenience. He is very influential man and has rendered sincere service to my Guru Maharaja by translating many Goswami literatures in Telugu language, as well as in English. With his cooperation there is possibility of opening a branch in Bombay. I hope you will do the needful immediately.

Hop you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
