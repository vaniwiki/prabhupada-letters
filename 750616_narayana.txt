My dear Narayana dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 10, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your report on Hanuman, I am forwarding your letter to Hrdayananda Goswami who can present this problem to the GBC for their solution.

I have accepted Saunaka dasa for 2nd initiation. His thread and mantra sheet are enclosed. Let him hear the tape of myself chanting the gayatri mantra through his right ear.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
