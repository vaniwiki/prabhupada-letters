New Vrindaban

My dear Kirtanananda Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 22, 1974 with enclosed copy of Brijbasi Spirit and your check for Dollars 500.00. Thank you very much. Here in India one important Hindi paper has published a big article on your New Vrindaban and they much appreciated it, and gave very good report. I have asked them to reprint the article here. So you develop New Vrindaban to your hearts content, and when my palace will be ready I shall go there and stay. I like very much that place, very calm and quiet.

Yes, following the rules and regulations is the real qualification of GBC. We have made things easy for being qualified for such position, but still they are violating. Haridasa Thakura only took one of the items, the chanting, and he was so affectionate to Lord Caitanya. He was doing nothing, just chanting, but that means that he was doing everything. Your conclusion is very good and I very much appreciate that GBC or XYZ you are always servant of Krishna. That is wanted.

I have not yet received the written report of the Enquiry Commission, but one telegram is received and I am telegrammed Bali Mardan to immediately come here.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
