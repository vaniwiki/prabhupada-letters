My dear Guru das,

Please accept my blessings. I was in due receipt of your letter dated Sept. 3, 1968, and now I have received letter from Mukunda, and I am pleased to learn that you are now together, all six. So please try to start the temple as soon as possible and call me for your service. Offer my blessings to Yamuna as well as to Malati and her husband and the little child. I have sent one newspaper cutting to Syamasundara; that is a very nice article, if you get it photostatted, you can use it for propaganda work. Hope this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
