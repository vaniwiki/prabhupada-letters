My dear Balai Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your very nice letter along with some pictures of your daughter Nandini Dasi. I am so glad to see that you are raising your daughter in Krsna consciousness and that is your duty as conscientious mother to give the child proper education in spiritual living.

It is very encouraging to me to know that both yourself and your good husband are combined so nicely for setting the example of Krishna conscious family life. And now you have such a good daughter who is naturally devotee of Krsna, so if you kindly continue to advance on these lines as I have already chalked out for you your perfection of life in Krsna's service is guaranteed.

Please offer my blessings also to your good husband, Sriman Advaita and your daughter, Nandini Dasi.* I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Why not ask your daughter to contribute to my book fund whatever she collects.\\
