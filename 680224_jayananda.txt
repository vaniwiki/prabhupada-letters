My dear Jayananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your latest letter, and I am so glad to learn that you are making nice arrangements for my lecturing in different places, and I expect to return in San Francisco by the tenth of March, and wish to execute all programs within 20-30 days from the date of my arrival before starting for New York. I shall be very glad to initiate girl friend if you recommend her actual mental condition. We should not initiate anyone who is not willing to follow our regulations. In the meantime let her attend our classes and join the Sankirtana program regularly. I am so pleased to learn that you are by the Grace of Krishna improving day by day in the matter of Krishna Consciousness. Thank you very much for your sincere service. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
