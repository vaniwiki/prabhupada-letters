My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your good wife Yamuna. I am in due receipt of your letters dated 30th August and 6th September, 1971, respectively and have noted the contents carefully. Also enclosed was a copy of the letter to Hans Roy Gupta from K. C. Pant. Thank you for securing this nice letter. You should send a copy of this letter to all our centers in India so that if there is any harassment of the security police, we can utilize it. I think that in Bombay since they have received this letter, our devotees are not complaining about police harassment. Also it is understood that Bhatliwalla that most disturbing element, is now a days also silent. So all this is a great help done by Hans Roy Gupta. He is a very nice man. So keep good relationship with him. He can be a great help in the future also provided he keeps a good impression of our society. If he keeps a good impression he will be able to help in all respects.

Yes, when you will give me a complete list of the chief guests and on what dates they will come, then I shall give you the subject matter on which I will speak. I shall make the subject matter according to the guests. Perhaps you remember in London when I spoke in Conway hall. Similarly I shall give you a list.

Yes, take the recommendation of the Mayor, J. Dalmia and others. That will be a very great help. Make a copy of the letter to show to individuals that our service is approved by the government and the mayor also. That will be most beneficial.

President Giri must be chief guest (preside) one day at least. If Giri can attend one day then why not Indira Gandhi? If Indira Gandhi says that she cannot attend such a function then how the president will attend? Is there any difference between the president and the prime minister? There is no need to invite Dr. Radhakrishnan. He is a retired man. So your selection is already nice. We want all influential men to sympathize with our movement. That is our aim, because if these big men are sympathetic then all the common people will follow.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
