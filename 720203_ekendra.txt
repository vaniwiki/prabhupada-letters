Dear Ekendra dasa;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. %%__%% and have noted the contents carefully.

I am very pleased that you are keeping to a very strict schedule and are reading my literature daily. If you continue in this manner you will grow up to be a first class preacher of Krsna consciousness. And this is the highest service that you can perform. I am looking forward to visiting Gurukula in Dallas when I return to the U.S. in the spring.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
