My dear Lokanatha,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil.

Regarding having more Hindi books to distribute, that you'll have by the end of the month. Ask Gopala Krishna when they'll be ready, they can be sent to Kanpur. Prasad distribution and chanting and book distribution is sufficient for your program. There is no special method other than this simple program. You must train up the men. I hope you will be able to do that. Keep your behavior right to the point, set a very good example and others will follow.

Yes, I want you to concentrate on preaching. You must see whether Gopala Krishna can give any men as you have suggested. It will be nice if you can organize Kanpur preaching. The men there are %%__%% and rich also. In this connection you can take advise from Aksayananda. He has got sufficient experience. The more you get popular you can increase the propaganda paraphernalia. There is enough money in Kanpur. There you can raise any amount.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
