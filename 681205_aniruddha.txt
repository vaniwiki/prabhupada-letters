====== Letter to: Aniruddha ======

My dear Aniruddha,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated Nov. 30, 1968 and I thank you for the report of progress at your temple.

Now it is understood that you are taking charge of Girish and I think that you may teach him very nicely the principles of Bhagavad-gita As It Is. Then, when this is learned you may go on to Srimad-Bhagavatam. In this way we wish to train all of the boys of his age who come to our temples. If you can take charge of this teaching, we can immediately open a teaching department where such instructions can go on. Hayagriva has agreed to take charge of such a teaching department and when he comes to see me soon, I will talk with him in detail. We want such teaching department to teach and raise children to the standard of Krishna Consciousness. You can make trial with Girish and let me know how it is progressing.

Yesterday, we have contracted one nice temple site on La Cienega Boulevard. It is previously a chapel but now I wish to organize it to be one nice temple for Krishna Consciousness. Let us see how Krishna will help us. But there is good possibility to develop it into a nice temple. The rent is $500 each month but they have agreed to $400 for the first year.

So far as the lady psychiatrist making tests with our children, you should know that our children are fireproof and waterproof due to Krishna Consciousness so there is no harm for them. Let them test if they wish, we shall come out successful.

I hope this meets you in good health. Please also convey my blessings to the other devotees there.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
