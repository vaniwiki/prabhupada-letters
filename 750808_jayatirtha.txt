My dear Jayatirtha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. Yes, it is all right if you pay something monthly. The monthly dividend is all right. Please send me the balance of the M-V Fund.

Regarding the Bank claim, is it necessary to correspond with them? We do not know whether we have received two or three or whatever payments from them. Anyway, whatever we get, we spend.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
