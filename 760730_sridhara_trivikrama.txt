My dear Sridhara and Trivikrama Maharaja's:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7 July 1976 and have noted the contents with care.

Yes, I immediately accept for initiation Naisen Wang. Her name shall be Nitya lila dasi and I have personally chanted on her beads which are enclosed. She is a very good devotee and she must immediately be initiated. This girl should be trained up and educated to speak in Chinese and recruit Chinese boys and girls. Just try to create a Chinese group of devotees from Taiwan then all other things are done automatically. We require immediately a Chinese group of devotees. Tamala Krsna Goswami is arranging for the money, you can communicate with him. He has also just sent two men there to assist you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
