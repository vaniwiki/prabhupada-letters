My dear Bhurijana,

Please accept my blessings. Replying to your letter dated April 14, 1969, I have already confirmed your meeting on the 15th and 16th of May, 1969, and I hope you have duly received the telegram which I have sent. Yesterday I have come to Buffalo, and Rupanuga has organized a very nice meeting of students. There were more than 200 students who were all participating in the chanting and dancing. So this Sankirtana Movement should be planned very diligently, and it should be pushed on. Then our propaganda will surely come out successful. Everywhere we are seeing good results from Sankirtana, so let us do our best for the service of the Lord.

I hope this will meet you in good health, and please offer my blessings to Tosana Krishna also.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please inform Pradyumna in Columbus about the meeting in your place.
