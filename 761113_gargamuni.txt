Calcutta

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram reading as follows; "Due to your displeasure with Vrindaban management ..."

Before this I received one letter form you addressed to Jagadisa. The reply to that letter is sent with Debu. There I have requested you to come here with the car. I've sent one letter to Bhavananda also, in which I requested him to preach in the interior of Bengal. Now he is in the limelight, so his attention should not be diverted.

Regarding management in Vrindaban, it is improving in My presence. I hope it will go on nicely. The only problem is the guest house. There are practically no guests. Out of 44 rooms we cannot engage even one daily. So, here is the real problem. We have invested in this guest house about 25 lakhs. So, without utilization of these rooms, we are losing about 20,000 per month. This is the real problem. Other problems are minor, they can be rectified. So, amongst yourselves discuss this guest house problem, and when you come, please bring the solution scheme. Then I will be able to talk with you how things can be improved.

The proposal of closing Calcutta center is very inauspicious. Any center we open cannot be closed at any cost, what to speak of the Calcutta center. You have asked for 2 lakhs loan. That can be also arranged, but why Calcutta center bank account is broken. I'm too much perturbed on this point. I was just planning to go to Mayapur when Jagadisa received your letter, therefore I postponed my journey to Mayapur until I come here and I shall discuss with you. My health is also not very sound, still I wanted to go to Mayapur. But, I think the Calcutta problem would give me more trouble even if I am in Mayapur. Thus, I postponed. So, when you come here we shall discuss the matter in detail.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
