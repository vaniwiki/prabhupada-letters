My dear Amogha das Adhikari:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 19, 1973 and have noted the contents. I am sorry to learn that you had to leave your engagement in Indonesia. Anyway, so now you are in Australia, so you can consult with Madhudvisa Swami as to what to do there in Indonesia, and you also consult with Karandhara Prabhu as to the passport problem. If necessary, you can take the Australian citizenship.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
