San Jose

My dear Madhukantha,

Please accept my blessings. I am very much thankful to you for your kindly report from San Jose far away from me now. I am always anxious to know about the activities of my Temples so far established. I always pray to Krsna that you, all my students, may go ahead in this Krsna Consciousness Movement.

The routine work, as it is going on in your center, appears to be very satisfactory. Please keep this standard continually and Krsna will give you all facilities.

I am very glad to learn that the different libraries are accepting our books and surely they will find them absolutely beneficial. This line of thought, namely Krsna Consciousness or God-consciousness, is completely new in the Western world or throughout the whole world. People in general have got somewhat a vague idea of God consciousness. When I first went to your country in New York, I found everyone imbibed with the idea that God is dead. Now gradually people are understanding that God is not only not dead, but He is factually present with us at every moment. If we have the necessary qualification, to see God eye-to-eye is quite possible.

So it is a nice Movement. We have now sufficient literatures. Now go on preaching this cult for the complete welfare activities in the human societies.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
