My dear Pancadravida and Aksojananda Swamis,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your travelling sankirtana report of 11 June, 1974.

Your work in Bangalore is very commendable and the report is pleasing to me. Go on preaching and making life members and distribute my books as much as possible. This is exactly the meaning of Lord Caitanya's teaching and by carrying it out surely you will receive His blessings which is to achieve Love of Krsna.

Your report that a Christian gentleman became a life member being attracted to our books is also our experience. Just today we spoke at a seminary in Melbourne, Australia, and the young Franciscan monks listened very respectfully. When speaking to Christians we never say our religious system is better than theirs but we speak on the principles of love of God, Sa __vai pumsam paro dharmo__ [[books:sb:1:2:6|(SB 1.2.6)]]. They become convinced and pleased to hear our explanations of God consciousness based on the Vedic conclusion---if they are at all sincere. So whenever you come upon such gentlemen or institutions try to place our books there and make them life members also.

I shall be glad to hear from you again. Be sure to regularly send all collections to the BBT.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
