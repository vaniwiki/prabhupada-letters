====== Letter to: Batu Gopala ======

Cleveland

My dear Batu Gopala dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 27, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for distributing my books so enthusiastically. You are right. We must all become ideal in our character and then people will be very impressed with such purity. A devotee is faultless. He has no flaws.

I have accepted the devotees that you have recommended for 1st initiation and their names are as follows: Leon---Lilamohana, Virginia---Venu-Vilasa devi dasi, John---Gurugovinda dasa. Their beads can be chanted on by Kirtanananda Svami. Make sure that all of these candidates follow our principles very staunchly. Train them nicely by your own example.

I have also accepted Madhyam devi dasi and Vajasana devi dasi as duly initiated brahmanas. Their mantra sheets are enclosed herein. Let them hear the gayatri mantra through the right ear from the tape of myself chanting it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
