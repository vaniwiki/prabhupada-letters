Dear Urvasi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 18, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am glad to learn that you are taking up Krsna Consciousness under the guidance of Shaktimati prabhu. You should follow her example. She is an experienced devotee. You assist her and help spread Krsna consciousness especially amongst the Asian community there. I have given permission for Shaktimati and Navayogendra to combine together for establishing a temple there in Mombassa especially for the Asian community so you also assist in this endeavor. Be sure to follow the regulative principles of chanting 16 rounds without fail each day. Also, we do not take any coffee, tea, or cigarettes, meat, fish, or eggs, illicit sex, or any gambling. Be sure and read my books very carefully, Bhagavad-gita, then Srimad-Bhagavatam, and then Caitanya Caritamrta. You should read every day without fail and become fixed in our philosophy. If you are going to England, we have our temples there so there should be no difficulty for you to remain in Krsna consciousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
