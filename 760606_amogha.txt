====== Letter to: Amogha ======

Bombay

My dear Amogha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 22, 1976 as well as your letter of May 26, 1976 along with the list of standing orders thus far received. The library party is doing very nicely. It is nectar to my ears to hear the list of schools which are taking our standing order.

Concerning the Nitya Svarupa edition of the Srimad-Bhagavatam that was given to us, I was informed by Prabhavisnu das that the professor who has kindly given them is requesting that since the books cost so much he should be given patron membership. I have one set here in Los Angeles however the paper is so brittle that when you touch the paper, it breaks. Practically it is unuseable. Also, the professor has said that the books would cost Rs. 3,000/- but I happen to know that they could only cost about ?Rs. 700/-. In any case, if the pages are brittle, what is the use. We cannot give him patron membership in exchange for the set of books. Anyway, when I return to Vrindaban, I shall see the set of books, and then I can decide further on this matter.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
