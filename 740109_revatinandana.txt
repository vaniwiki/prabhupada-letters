====== Letter to: Revatinandana ======

London

My dear Revatinandana Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter Jan. 4, 1974 with the enclosed cookbook.

I know you are a very good cook and I can understand that you have found the books useful for distribution. I have no objection to your printing it with the name "Revatinandana Swami's Cookbook", but the royalty should go to the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. Just as I am publishing Bhagavad-gita As It Is with Macmillan Co. but the royalty is going to the BBT. I think this method is appropriate. If you yourself take the royalty it will be personal interest in money and trade, and this will deviate your principle of __sannyasa.__ __Sannyasi__ means he is in renounced order and lives by begging alms for the bare necessities of life. It is not good to make trade to get money for personal expenditure. If the royalty is given to the BBT, we will keep a separate account from this royalty and necessary expenditures for your preaching may be supplied from the BBT.

Mukunda das has sent me a pamphlet in which the pictures are objectionable. The name of the place at Letchmore Heath we have already named Bhaktivedanta Manor, European Center of ISKCON. He has printed "Gokula Vrindaban". In the last picture there is a cowhead like a slaughterhouse cow with t-lock on. I have sent him a telegram to stop it and a detailed letter will follow to Mukunda. The telegram reads as follows: "Pamphlet picture most objectionable. Stop immediately. Letter follows." Please see that this is stopped by Mukunda.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Regarding taking snuff, I myself take it sometimes at night because I am working at night on my books, and sometimes I become dizzy. But it is not for you to take. You should not imitate this, neither you work like me at night.
