My dear Cyavana Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Zambia dated August 24, 1973. I am very much pleased with your preaching there, how you are making members and distributing books. It is also encouraging that the Indians there are taking note of the authority of this movement of Lord Caitanya.

Regarding the saligram sila, it will be installed along with the other Deities. I shall advise you. I am planning to come to Nairobi on the 19th or 20th of November for your installation program and remain there up to the end of the month when I shall start for South Africa.

Brahmananda Swami has read me your letter regarding the students there reading other books. I request you to stop this practice. Our students have no time to read our own books, but they have time to read other's books, and the money to purchase them? Why this mentality is there? You are a serious student, therefore you have correctly found out the defect in these books. We don't want babaji class. We want active preachers.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
