My dear Yasodalala das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter with enclosed check and I thank you very much.

The only way that we can overcome maya is by seriously and sincerely taking shelter of Krishna. __Daivi esa guna mayi mama maya duratyaya, mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te__ [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]]. So chant very sincerely and follow the four regulative principles strictly and very soon you will be able to find shelter from the miseries of material attachment.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
