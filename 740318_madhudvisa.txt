Dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have accepted the two Melbourne devotees for initiation as recommended by you and their names are given as follows:

Charles of the Sea---Praceta dasa

Christian---Camari dasi\\
Please instruct them in the ten offenses to chanting and hold a fire yajna there. You may chant on their beads.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
