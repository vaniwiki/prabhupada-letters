====== Letter to: Sri Krishan Pandit ======

My dear Sri Krishan Pandit,

Kindly accept my greetings. I am very much thankful to you for your letter dated June 15, 1967. Your prayers to Lord Krishna are heard by the Lord, and by His Grace I'm getting improved in health day by day. Your suggestion to return to India is welcome. As soon as I get a little strength I must return to India. I also thank your son-in-law, Yog Raj Sharma, for his suggestion.

As you have not received the gramaphone record as yet, I guess it has been taken away by somebody. Therefore, I have advised my students to send another one by registered post. With that record was a check for Rs 50. (check no. 0055447, dated April 15, 1967) in your favor, so you go to the Bank of Baroda, Chandnichawk, Delhi, and stop the payment by showing this letter, and upon hearing from you I shall arrange for sending you cash from here. Your former letter was properly replied from here. I request you to see Messrs. S.S. Brijbasse Co. at Fatehpuri. We sent them an order for pictures and $100., but they are silent. Kindly enquire what is the fate of the money and the order.

My blessings for your wife and children.

Hope you are well, and thanking you once again.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
