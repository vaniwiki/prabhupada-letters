My Revered Sripada Sridhara Maharaja,

Please accept my humble dandabats. As we are eager to meet, I am sending hereby Sriman Satadhanya das to hand over this message: I can send my personal car at any time you like to come here. Kindly let me know when I shall send my car to bring Your Holiness here to our temple.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Yours very sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
