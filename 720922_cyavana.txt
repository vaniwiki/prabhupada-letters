Nairobi

My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter dated 18th September 1972, and with great satisfaction I have noted the contents therein. I am pleased to understand that things are once again back to normal in Nairobi and that you are all very enthusiastic to spread our preaching work amongst the Africans and American and European boys and girls there. I have heard from Rsi Kumar also that South Africa is first class field in Africa for preaching. Now you say the basic expenditures are finished and we have got very nice place there, now concentrate on making men into devotees and recruiting especially the African boys for helping us preach all over the continent of Africa. That is very good news that you have sent more than $1,200 to Karandhara, now you may order as many more books as you require from him and take similar sanction from the government for repaying him.

Now concentrate your efforts by bringing our regular program up to the highest standards, that is, holding street __sankirtana,__ holding at regular times of the day very opulent __aratrika__ with __prasadam__ distribution, having classes in philosophy, chanting sixteen rounds, etc. This is our strength. If you practice these things now with full concentration and carry on the regular propaganda work, automatically people will come forward for helping and you will make also devotees there. That is our Krsna Consciousness process of regular program.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
