Tucson

My dear Sukadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th February, 1971 and have noted the contents. It is very encouraging to note that you have been distributing 150 BTGs daily there in our newly established Tucson center. Actually we want that every American have a copy of BTG in his hand.

You should collect at least 25 cents per copy of BTG. We have to do in that way. Otherwise we will become debtor to Dai Nippon. Other instructions in this matter may be gotten from Karandhara, whom I have recently written.

Also you should be very enthusiastic for distributing our books to schools, colleges, libraries, bookstores, and wherever else you can imagine that they will be well received. These books are so nice that anyone who reads them is sure to become Krishna Conscious. You can show them Krsna books and ask them to read any part and if they like what they have read they should purchase, and if not you will walk away. Who could resist? Krsna book is so nice that everyone will like it, either as a story book or history or philosophy or whatever, they are sure to be attracted. Simply it depends on your presentation. So do it nicely and Krsna will help you.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Yes, if Karandhara has recommended it, both you and Narada Muni Das may get yourselves married. I have no objection. But you must be sure that you can meet all the responsibilities of household life; then it is all right.

Yes, when I go to L.A. I may visit your temple.\\
