====== Letter to: Temple President and GBC for Hawaii ======

Temple President and GBC for Hawaii

My dear disciples,

Please accept my blessings. I have consented that when and if a new set of Pancatattva Deities are installed in the Hawaii Temple, the old set of Pancatattva Deities may be given to Govinda dasi. Please comply this at the said time, as Govinda dasi would like to worship these Deities if new Deities are installed in the Temple.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
