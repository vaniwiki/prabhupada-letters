My dear Guru Gauranga and all other Paris devotees,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your nice letters dated August 18 and 19th 1973. I was very much pleased to come there and visit. Paris is developing nicely step by step. When I was at the Hotel de Ville I thought that this is better than London. So Paris is a most important city of the world. Work with great enthusiasm and make Krishna more prominent than Napoleon and Eiffel tower.

I hope this letter meets you all in good health and jolly mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.
