My dear Gopala Krsna das,

Please accept my blessings. Concerning the idea of exchanging our books for Russian books, unless we find sellers in India for Russian books (in English language), what will be the value of getting their books. You must ask the prominent book dealers in India what books from Russia (in English) are in demand and to what extent. Then when we exchange our books with the Russians, then we can request these specific books and we can easily sell them to the Indian booksellers. That way we will have no difficulty. If there is no customer for Russian books in India, then let the Russians take order for specific books and we can send them some of our books free of charge. That will prove that the Russians are actually poor.

So you can make this enquiry from the Indian booksellers, "If you are selling Russian books in the English language, if so, kindly send us the list." Then enquire from Russia, "we can supply our books in exchange for particular Russian books in the English language (those titles which are desired in India)."

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
