[TEXT MISSING]

dated April 17, 1968, and I thank you very much for it. I am so much pleased to hear that you are not afraid to stand alone, and to maintain the temple there nicely; krishna is always there with you, and He will see to your success. Do not feel that you have offended me. You have served Krishna very nicely and are continuing to do so very nicely. There is no question of your falling from my grace: you have always my blessings upon you, and I am always thinking of you, and praying Krishna to help you and give you more and more advancement in Krishna Consciousness. So please do not be disturbed in that way. Just continue with what you are doing there, and Krishna will give you all facilities and all protection.

I have arrived here in New York on the 17th afternoon: the trip was very quickly passed, and we were very nicely received at the airport, by both the press and the devotees. Here there are so many new flower-like young boys and girls, and they are all so much interested in Krishna Consciousness very seriously. I am surprised at their great enthusiasm, and I am very happy amongst them. Just try to make your temple there as successful as this one in New York; just work sincerely, and it will come.

Please keep me informed of your activities: I am so much happy to hear you are contacting reporters and radio and tv stations; please send me a copy of the news article whenever it appears. And please keep me informed at least once or more in a week. Hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
