My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated December 25, 1968 and I have carefully noted the contents. I am always encouraged to learn how you are working hard and progressing more and more in Krishna Consciousness.

In distributing the "perfection in yoga" leaflet, when people come to your temple you may explain to them the principles of yoga as they are described in the __Bhagavad-gita.__ Such instructions by you may be preceded and followed by Krishna kirtana. If they are interested, you may show them how to sit, concentrating the eyesight on the tip of the nose. The concentration should be on Lord Krishna or Lord Visnu, as is explained in __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ So if they come to know about hatha yoga you can show them in the authoritative scriptures how it cannot be successfully practiced in this present age of kali.

Regarding __Nectar of Devotion,__ you needn't bother about it now. We have solved the problem of what is to be done. Purusottama is now typing with the dictaphone, and he will then edit it and send to Rayarama for a final copy. So far as the new book, __"Krishna",__ I have already sent suggestions to Jadurani, and as soon as the pictures are drawn, I will send to you the tapes. In this way the __Krishna__ book will be completed.

I think that because Jadurani is not quite healthy at the present there is no need of overburdening with pregnancy. In her weakness, the child will be a burden for you and her. Also a child born in weak health is always unhealthy. So it is better you wait until the situation improves.

Please convey my blessings to the others at your temple. I hope that you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
