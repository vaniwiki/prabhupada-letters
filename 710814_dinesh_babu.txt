My dear Dinesh Babu,

Please accept my greetings. I hope you are doing well. I learned from other members of our society that you kindly sometimes visit our Mayapur center where we have already got one cottage. When I was in Calcutta we talked of purchasing more land. I am still prepared to purchase if we get bargain price or at least at the current local price but I have heard that people are asking more than the expectation. So conveniently you may go sometime at Mayapur and stay with our men and negotiate with persons. If they are prepared to sell the land at the right price, then I can purchase all the available land. My idea is to purchase land for agriculture so inmates may not depend on outsiders but grow food there and things may go on nicely.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
