My dear Sudama Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 18, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding the initiations, I have duly initiated them as follows:

Matt Johnson---Mahaksa

Greg Price---Daksa

Rick Parish---Rtu

Mike---Manohara

I also accept Sukhi devi for twice born brahmana initiation. So you can chant on the beads as it is required and hold a fire sacrifice and let the new brahmana hear the mantra through the right ear from the tape of my recording.

More when we meet in Vrindaban. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
