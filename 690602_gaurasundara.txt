My dear Gaurasundara,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated May 29, 1969, and I have carefully noted the contents. I am very glad to learn that you are seriously looking for some asrama site on the Hawaii island. If you are able to get some nice place there, it will be very successful because I know there are many young boys and girls there for you to chant with and speak with. This kirtana, chanting and speaking of Krishna, is the sure and certain method of propagating Krishna Consciousness, and we already have so much experience in all of our centers that if we simply chant Hare Krishna with karatalas and mrdanga and if we speak from __Bhagavad-gita__ just as we have heard it coming down from the disciplic succession, then automatically the people become attracted. So you simply find a nice site on the Hawaii island or any other place near there where there are many boys and girls, and if you simply follow the above procedures, then your success is automatically there. I am pleased to note that there is one boy named Tony who has become attracted to our movement and wishes to be initiated. He may send me his beads immediately. Please take nice care of him because there are so many good souls who we must inform of this most important philosophy, and when another man is sent by Krishna to help us it is our duty to help him understand Krishna Consciousness as far as possible.

I am very concerned to hear that Jayasri has now joined Govinda Dasi in becoming ill. I hope that by now they are both improved in health. Please convey my blessings to all of the devotees there, and I hope this will find all of you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Please let me know when you are in Hawaii.
