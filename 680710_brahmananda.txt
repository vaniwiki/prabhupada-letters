My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated July 5, 1968, and regarding the Kirtana collection, I have talked with Hansadutta who has arrived here last evening, and as proposed by you, that the contribution should be divided 50% for the temple, and 50% for the Sankirtana fund, is quite all right.

Regarding Mr. Kallman, I am enclosing herewith one letter addressed to him, and if you think it is wise to present my letter to him, and as requested therein, if you and Mr. Kallman come here I may be able to settle up your differences by the Grace of Krishna. But if you think the matter has gone too far, that there is no possibility of settlement, then you do not present the letter and let the matter take its own course as desired by Krishna.

Regarding Dai Nippon, please let me know whether you have sent the corrected proof sheets, and advise the Japanese bank in New York of necessary credit letter. Regarding Dwarkin and Son: I think you have sent one cablegram. If not, please send it now, and also ask United Shipping Corporation whether they have transferred the money to Dwarkin & Sons. If not ask them to do it. And ask Dwarkin & Sons to send more tanpuras covering the value which they received from United Shipping Corporation.

Also, if somebody is coming here in Montreal from New York, please send me the dictaphone transcribing set lying in my closet. I think there are two sets---one of them may be sent. Also, please send the Bhagavatam copy as I told you before.

Hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. I would like to know whether or not you have collected the money for that German book you took here from me. You can please send one set of Srimad-Bhagavatams to this address, to Sri Vamana dasa: Walther Eidlitz---Bavergrand 18A/III---Uppsala---Sweden.
