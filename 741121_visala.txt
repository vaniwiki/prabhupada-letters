My dear Visala Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 28th October, 1974 and I am glad to learn that you and especially your wife are doing nicely in Krishna Consciousness. I understand that you are sitting in Vrindaban. Anyway wherever you may be please continue your preaching. I also may ask you to cooperate with the temple authorities there and always chant Hare Krishna on your beads and follow the rules and regulations as I have given. In India especially, we must be careful to remain above any criticism especially in Vrindaban. Our behavior there and everywhere must be first class example.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
