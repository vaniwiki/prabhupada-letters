My dear Padmanabha and Mahojjvala dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your guru daksine gift and your nice letter expressing your appreciation for your spiritual master. This is the proper way to receive the blessings of Krsna, by begging the mercy of the spiritual master. __yasya prasadad bhagavata prasadao.__ If one pleases the spiritual master, then it is to be understood that Krsna is pleased.

So continue on in this way following our path of bhakti yoga with enthusiasm and you will have perfection in this life and the next.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
