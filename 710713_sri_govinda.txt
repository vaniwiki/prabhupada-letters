====== Letter to: Sri Govinda ======

Cleveland

My dear Sri Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th June, 1971 and have noted the contents. I am so much encouraged to hear how nicely you are distributing BTG and distributing our books also. So continue this program whole-heartedly and Krishna will surely bless you.

It is also encouraging to note that you are getting such a fine house for your new temple. It is so large and on the main street of Cleveland. I can tell that you are all sincere devotees because Krishna is giving you such nice facility to serve him. So make the house very gorgeous, to the standard of our L.A. and N.Y. temples and when you are ready, Radha and Krishna can be installed there also.

So far as ordering prints of Krishna from Jayapataka, all the GBC members here agree that it is not such a good proposal. It is much better, first of all, that these prints be gotten from us just as soon as they are printed up. Also it is much more important that you utilize your valuable time and energy to distribute our magazines and books. That is real propaganda work. And the householders can earn their livelihood by distributing our books also. That is one of the points of our new book distribution program and you can get more details from Karandhara or Rupanuga.

On Friday, 16th July, I will be going to Detroit for two days. So if you would come and see me at that time, that would be very nice.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there in Cleveland. Hoping this will meet you all in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
