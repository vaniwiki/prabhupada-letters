My dear Bhagavan das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 20, 1975 and also the French Gita blue prints. Is that the paper that it will be printed on. This paper is very nice. I have also seen the Spanish literature you have published. Why you do not use the literature they are publishing for South America?

Your qualification is that you can live amicably with anyone. Even if one is an offender to you, you do not become agitated. This is a Vaisnava qualification. I am glad to hear of the improvements of Amsterdam temple. That you are now getting so many more people for the feast program means that the management is very much improved.

Yes, I am looking forward to coming to France to see the castle.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
