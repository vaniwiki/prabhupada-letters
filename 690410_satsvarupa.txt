My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 5, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. I shall reach Boston Iskcon on the 23rd of April, and you can make arrangements accordingly. I have read your transcriptions of the __Krishna__ tapes, and you are doing it very nicely. I am very much pleased with your efforts.

Regarding Jadurani's question, hearing the vibration of Hare Krishna automatically reminds one of Krishna's Pastimes. So both of them arise simultaneously in the mind when one is sincerely chanting. So you cannot make any distinction between listening to the sound and thinking of the Pastimes. But the process is to hear, and then Krishna's Pastimes, Form, Qualities, etc. will automatically come to mind: That is very nice.

I hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood. I will be looking forward to seeing you once again.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
