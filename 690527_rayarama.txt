My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 21, 1969, and I have noted the contents carefully. Regarding the Composer machine, there will be no difficulty in transferring the money to the Iskcon Press account. But in Columbus they are already so negotiating for a similar IBM Composer, so let me see what is their terms here. After comparing I shall definitely instruct you on this matter. Regarding Sankirtana, you can go out four days in a week, but try to go out as much as possible. So far as Birbhadra is concerned, he may immediately come here to New Vrindaban, and I shall also call his mother here.

Please convey my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
