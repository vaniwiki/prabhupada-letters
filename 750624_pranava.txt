My dear Pranava das:

Please accept my blessings. How is that there is no news from you about the land? I expected to receive news through Nitai, but there is no news. Please see to this matter as I have requested you in my previous letter, the copy of which is enclosed.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
