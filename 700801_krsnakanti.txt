My dear Krsnakanti,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 26th July, 1970, and was very glad to note the contents. I beg also to thank you for the check which you enclosed for $100 to my book fund and I receive it very gladly as we have expended recently so much for printing our literatures and we have many more manuscripts ready for publication. I am so happy to learn that both yourself and Sriman Gajendra are now married to two of my beloved daughters. I am proposing that our Temples now be managed by the householder couples so this is very nice for you now. Please take this opportunity offered you all by Krsna very seriously and do not misuse your life for sense gratification. You are a very intelligent boy I know and a very sincere devotee of Lord Krsna. Now you have got a good wife who is also intelligent girl and devotee, so live peacefully working together for pushing on this Krsna consciousness movement for the ultimate benefit of all concerned. So you both husband and wife please take my blessings and blessings of Lord Krsna and be happy in Krsna's transcendental loving service.

Please offer my blessings to Gajendra and his good wife, Herapancami.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
