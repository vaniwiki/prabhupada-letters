My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your letter of December 25, 1968. I am awaiting your pictures of the house which might be used for prasadam program. So far as the press utilizing this place it is not possible because the press is to be set up either in New Vrindaban or in New York.

Here in Los Angeles we have a very nice place. The rent is very high, but if we can maintain this establishment it will surely have great future prospects. I am glad to know that you now have a nice apartment. Live comfortable there and try to improve the temple conditions to your best capacity. If there will be an opportunity to purchase the new house you have found, try your best for this.

I thank you so much for having nicely appreciated the __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ This book should be read by all of my students at least one chapter per day, and in kirtana class it should be discussed sloka after sloka. Practically, we have tried to explain in this book all of the basic principles of Krishna Consciousness. If you can simply cram Bhagavad-gita then you will surely become a very good preacher.

Next January there will be an examination on this Bhagavad-gita. Papers will be sent by me to all centers, and those securing the minimum passing grade will be given the title as Bhakti-sastri. Similarly, another examination will be held on Lord Caitanya's Appearance Day in February, 1970 and it will be upon __Srimad-Bhagavatam__ and __Bhagavad-gita.__ Those passing will get the title of Bhakti-vaibhava. Another examination will be held sometimes in 1971 on the four books, __Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam, Teachings of Lord Caitanya,__ and __Nectar of Devotion.__ One who will pass this examination will be awarded with the title of Bhaktivedanta. I want that all of my spiritual sons and daughters will inherit this title of Bhaktivedanta, so that the family transcendental diploma will continue through the generations. Those possessing the title of Bhaktivedanta will be allowed to initiate disciples. Maybe by 1975, all of my disciples will be allowed to initiate and increase the numbers of the generations. That is my program. So we should not simply publish these books for reading by outsiders, but our students must be well versed in all of our books so that we can be prepared to defeat all opposing parties in the matter of self-realization.

Please keep me informed as to the progress of the prasadam program. I hope that this finds you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Offer my blessings for Smt. Himavati my beloved daughter.
