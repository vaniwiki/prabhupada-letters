My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter and check duly. I have already sent necessary instructions through Hansadutta. You are all my limbs of my body. Unless you cooperate, my life will be useless. The senses and life are correlative. Without life the senses cannot act and without sense, life is inactive. I have advised Hansadutta to cooperate fully with you. The 50% arrangement is agreed.

Regarding Kallman affairs: please try to get out of it, even at a loss. And for future, take lessons out of it. For us desiring to go back to Krishna, persons engaged in sense gratification business is more dangerous than poison. But rest assured Krishna will save you from this entanglement.

Have you sent the cable to Dwarkin? We want Mrdangas very urgently because very soon we shall be going to London. Six devotees from the West coast and six devotees from the East coast, 12 for Kirtana besides my humble self, and one or two Brahmacaris. Henceforward our plan should be to push Sankirtana and sell our publications. For books, Brahmananda, for magazine, Rayarama, for Sankirtana, Hansadutta and Mukunda, and for suggestion, my humble self. Please let us concentrate this integration and I am sure our movement will be successful.

Hoping you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
