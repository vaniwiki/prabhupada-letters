My dear Madhudvisa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you for your nice invitation card. Thousands of Caitanya Mahaprabhu temples may be established all over Australia so that I may receive one invitation card at least every month. Physical health does not allow me to move very much, but my mind is absorbed in thinking of you with blessings of Krishna.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
