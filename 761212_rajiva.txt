My dear Rajiva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil.

Regarding your working on the translation of the second canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, we shall see later on, for now just try to finish what you have begun.

I am going from Hyderabad on the 17th to Wardha for Gita Pratisthan conference. From there I will go to Bombay by the 22nd. After Bombay it is not yet fixed up, but most likely I will go to the Kumba Mela in Allahabad in January.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
