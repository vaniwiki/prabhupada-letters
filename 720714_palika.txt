My dear Palika,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 4, 1972, and I am very much pleased to hear that all the preparation for Rathayatra Festival are very nice. Regarding the Jagannatha deities, They can be placed on the altar, that is sufficient.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
