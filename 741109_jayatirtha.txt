My dear Jayatirtha das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram reading as follows: C D RATE DOWN TO 8 AND HALF PERCENT PLEASE ADVISE ON RENEWAL -JAYATIRTHA

So, yes it can be continued. It is 3 per cent less than what they were giving. What can be done?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wishes,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Your following cable is just now received. CD'S EXPIRING NOVEMBER 7 AND NOVEMBER 15 PLEASE ADVISE IF ANY CHANGES DESIRED OTHERWISE THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR 119 DAYS -JAYATIRTHA.

So it is all right.
