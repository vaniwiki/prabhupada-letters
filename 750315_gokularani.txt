====== Letter to: Gokularani ======

Bhaktivedanta Manor

My dear Gokularani dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. I thank you very much for your kind donation of 10 English Pounds. Please try and render devotional service very carefully following all of the rules and regulations mentioned in our books. Always chant at least 16 good rounds daily. If you try very sincerely to do these things Krishna will help you and you will become spiritually perfect in this life.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
