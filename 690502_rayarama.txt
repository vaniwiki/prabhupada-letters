My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 28, 1969, and I was very glad to note the contents. Regarding the IBM Composer, I think Krishna desires to have this machine because printing of our books in Japan is gradually fading due to the Japanese people's changing their words. I understand from Brahmananda that negotiations were going on between $5,000 and $6,000, and now they want to increase the price to $8,000. I do not therefore wish to deal with them. We must find out some other source for printing our books. But one thing, if we can present our composed pages, why not print them in New York? Behind my apartment, 26 Second Avenue, there is one press, Glen Press. Sometimes they printed our Prospectus. So why don't you take quotation from them about printing our books in 8 page sheets or as they can suitably print on their machine. You can immediately go and see the press, and take price, saying that we shall give the composed pages and select the paper also and provide it. What will be their charges for printing four pages or eight pages on one side? That means eight pages a form or sixteen pages a form. Then we can get it printed there and do our own folding and binding. So immediately take quotation for this, either from Glen Press or any other press. Then the problem of printing will be solved. If we can get the printing done in New York it is the best. In the meantime, you negotiate for the IBM Composer suitable for all of our purposes, books and magazines, and I shall ask Brahmananda to pay $600.00 when the negotiation is complete.

Regarding the boy, Birbhadra, I am glad to learn that you are taking proper care. The boy is very intelligent, but you should not only be kind upon him, that is understood because we should always be kind, but at the same time you should be very strict on disciplinary method. I have seen your notes of the meeting held in Buffalo, and surely they will be useful. I am pleased that you are working on __Nectar of Devotion,__ and please try to have it ready as planned.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
