My dear Shri Karani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of two checks totaling U.S. 12,000 from you and your brother. Thank you very much.

The checks will be deposited in our BBT account for printing books. I am instructing my disciple in charge of our BBT branch in Los Angeles to send one full set of our books complete for you and your brother.

It is very important that these books be distributed world wide. By reading people will get good opinion of our movement and philosophy.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
