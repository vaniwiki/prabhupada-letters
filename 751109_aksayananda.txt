My dear Aksayananda Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 5, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding the Life Member collection, Rs. 20,000/- collected locally is not a joke. To collect so much from visitors is Krishna's grace. This is very good. If you simply please the visitors, you will get so many Life Members. Simply I want that by the local collection and the receipts of the Guest House you maintain everything. We are considering to get a temple in Kuruksetra, so the collection from Delhi may be employed there. So it is a good sign that the visitors are becoming Life Members. So follow this policy, and very soon your temple will become self-sufficient.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
