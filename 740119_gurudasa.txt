Dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. Please find enclosed a copy of a letter to the Punjab National Bank, Vrindaban Branch, and a copy of the transfer advice of $100,000 from the Security Pacific National Bank. On receipt of this kindly see the manager of the Punjab National Bank in Vrindaban and see if they have done the needful.

I am reaching New Delhi airport February 3rd, at 4:30 A.M. on Pan American flight number 1.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
