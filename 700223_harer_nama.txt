My dear Harer Nama,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17 February, 1970, and I have noted the contents. I inquired about your temple's financial condition just to know if you are doing well without any difficulty, there was no other cause for this inquiry.

I am very glad to learn that three new boys have joined with you and are living at the temple. These new boys should be taken care of very nicely. We should always remember that we are in the kingdom of Maya and her influence is very strong. So, unless we are very, very careful in our dealings, there is always chance of falling down. Please therefore chant regularly the sixteen rounds beads and follow the regulative principles; and teach the new boys by practical example, and try to preach Sankirtana as far as possible.

We have our new book, "Isopanisad," published. It is very attractive and instructive also. Try to get them from Boston center.

I am very glad that your good wife is now for some time taking example of devotional service from Silavati and others in our Los Angeles temple. The program here in the L.A. temple is very nice and I am sure she will benefit from such good association in Krsna Consciousness.

Please offer my blessings to Dinabandhu, Neal, and all the others there in Boulder center. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
