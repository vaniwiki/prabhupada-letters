====== Letter to: Govinda ======

Kamuela, Hawaii

My dear Govinda dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 28th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for your kind donation of $100. I am very glad to hear that you are continuing your drawing work nicely. This is your business. Krishna has given you some special talent and you are using it for spreading His glories. This is wanted. I will be arriving at Honolulu on May 25th, 1975 and at that time I can see you. I will be staying there in Honolulu for at least one month, so we can talk during my visit sometimes.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
