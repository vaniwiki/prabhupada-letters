My dear Sucharu deva dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated nil and have noted the contents. I have written Mahamsa Svami one letter asking him if it is possible for you to return to Hyderabad. Wherever you go always be sure to chant at least 16 good rounds and rise early, attend mangala-aroti, study my books and serve Krishna without stop.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
