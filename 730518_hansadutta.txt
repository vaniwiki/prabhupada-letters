====== Letter to: Hansadutta ======

Heidelberg, West Germany

My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 12, 1973, and have noted the contents carefully.

Thank you very much for your report of the London situation. We can understand from this incident that the most important point is that everyone, especially the leaders, must always stick to the basic regulative practices that I have given, especially 16 rounds each day.

So, now what can be done? I expect to be going to London sometime after the first week of June. You may come there at that time.

I am very pleased to note that you are opening another center in Zurich.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
