My dear Nandarani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very kind letter dated 10th December, 1970. I am so glad to hear from you. I am always thinking of you and your husband Dayananda and have not heard from either of you in such a long time. You can ask Dayananda Prabhu to write me also.

You write to say that it is your constant prayer that even in household life to always be engaged in Krishna's service. That will be the success of my mission when you do that. I went to your country to create exemplary families. So I am confident that you and your husband shall be one of them. With this end I train you all in Krishna Consciousness. Train your daughters in the same light.

You also write to say please take this body as a tool and utilize it to spread this holy mission. Your body is already sold to Krishna. Therefore you should be engaged to pick up some service and render it to Krishna. We are all sold to Krishna and we have no other business but His service. That should be our determination.

I am so much obliged to you for your nice sentiments. Krishna will bless you. Both husband and wife and Karandhara husband and wife, improve temple management more and more. Most probably very soon I shall return to the U.S.A. Offer my blessings to all. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
