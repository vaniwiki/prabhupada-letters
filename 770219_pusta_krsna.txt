Dear Pusta Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of February 7, 1977, and examined the contents.

Regarding your intention to study Sanskrit and Hindi at the university, that is not good. You have to give service with whatever you already have, not that you have to learn anything extra. It is also not possible to learn Sanskrit and Hindi at this late age; it will be a waste of time. Even if you can speak a little broken Hindi it will not be useful.

As for your idea that your preaching will be more appreciated in the west if you are a professional or professor, we are already being appreciated by the professors. We don't want more. That is not our achievement. Real achievement is how we are advanced in Krsna Consciousness. That does not depend on degrees. As stated in the Bhagavatam, ahaituki apratihata, devotional service has to be executed without any condition, and there is no impediment. One doesn't become a great devotee on account of university degrees.

As for my signing your recommendation, I am referring that to the GBC meeting to take place here in Mayapur. But you should not have used my stationary letterhead without my permission.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
