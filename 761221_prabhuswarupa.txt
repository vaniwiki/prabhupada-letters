My dear Prabhuswarup Das:

Please accept my blessings.I have already met with Jayapataka Swami and have given him full instructions regarding our Hare Krishna Centre at Haridaspur. So you may contact him and the other local managers at Shree Mayapur regarding your effort.

May this letter find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
