====== Letter to: Don ======

Edmonton

My dear Don prabhu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter dated April 7, 1972 and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. I am especially engladdened that you have gone to such cold climate as northern Canada and despite all difficulty you are making good progress in the advancement of Krishna Consciousness there. I have read your booklet with great pleasure and I am forwarding it to Back to Godhead for publishing.

Now you have got a first-class temple. Krishna is very pleased and has given you all facility, so you go on like this, increasing in your devotional attitudes and surely you will get the perfection of your life. I very much look forward to your Book #2 to see that you are making further progress.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
