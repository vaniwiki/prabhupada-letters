My dear Kesava das,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your two letters, one dated December 15, 1971 and the other without date, requesting initiation and sacred threads for many boys. So as you have recommended them I will be sending their new names, beads, and threads in a few days.

I have been receiving so many reports about how my disciples of the San Francisco Temple cannot be surpassed by anyone in distributing my books. Sometimes they are selling as many as 70 Krishna Books daily. So if this is true then certainly when I return to the U.S. I must come and stay in your Temple. By distributing my books profusely you are giving me great encouragement to translate. And you are all helping me to fulfill the order which Guru Maharaja gave me. So I am so much grateful to you, and I am sure Krishna will bless you a million times over, for doing this work.

I hope that you and all my beloved disciples in San Francisco Temple are in strong health and jolly mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. My itinerary is tentatively that by the 12th January I am going to Jaipur for a five day festival, then I will return to Bombay and leave for Nairobi by the 25th January. Then I have to return to India to go to Mayapur for the celebration of Lord Caitanya's Appearance Day. From there I am planning to go to Hong Kong, Sydney, Tokyo, Hawaii, and then return to the U.S.\\
