====== Letter to: Bhanutanya ======

Brooklyn

My dear Bhanutanya dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. You should understand that Krishna Consciousness is a purificatory process. One may not be purified immediately, but since he is on the right path for purification, one should not criticize him for some faults that he may still have. Just because some body has made some mistakes does that mean that you should give up your whole career in Krishna Consciousness? What will that accomplish? Simply more rebirth and death. The fact that you have left our movement just on account of some minor disagreements shows that you are not actually serious about going back to home, back to Godhead. I suggest that you become serious about spiritual life and try to overlook the minor offenses of others. You should keep yourself in the association of devotees, chant at least 16 rounds, read my books and follow all of the rules and regulations very strictly.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami\\
