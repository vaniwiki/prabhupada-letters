My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 3rd May, 1970. Regarding the check which you have sent, Gargamuni says that he has not yet received it.

I am so pleased to see how you are carrying our Sankirtana program amidst the demonstrations of the people. This newspaper clipping which you have sent is just portraying the point of our business, and I have made xeroxes and am distributing them to various parties as example of our work. This Sankirtana Movement of Lord Caitanya is most practical and authorized, so such incidents are to be expected, but this is a great credit for our propaganda efforts.

I have already dispatched to you by separate mail an invitation to visit our L.A. center and meet personally with me at that time. So I am expecting to meet with you when you can come at your convenience, and then we can discuss such questions as you have asked as well as any others you may have.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife Krsna Bhamini and your son Vaisnava das and all the other Prabhus there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
