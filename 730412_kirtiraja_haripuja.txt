My dear Son Kirtiraja dasa and Daughter Haripuja dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 12, 1973 with enclosed daksina of $100.00. I am very pleased with your activities, how you are leading householder life, Krishna conscious. This ideal I want to show your countrymen is only possible on the Krishna conscious platform. You remain steady on this platform, and this will be your benefit.

You are one of the trusted managers of the New York temple, and I am very much glad to see that the standard of temple activities is so nice. So Krishna has given you American intelligence, and I think this New York City is the greatest city in the world. So all you managers cooperate together and do something gorgeous. That is my instruction to you, and if you can do it Krishna will be very much pleased with you.

I hope this meets you both in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
