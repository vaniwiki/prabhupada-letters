Portland

My dear Danavir,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 20, 1972 and I have noted the contents. I am pleased to know that our Portland center is having good success in pushing on Lord Caitanya's great sankirtana movement. "Who God is" can be summed up in only five words. Krsna is the Supreme controller. If you become convinced of this, and preach it enthusiastically, success is assured, and you will be doing the greatest service for all living entities. So you continue more and more to serve Krsna, and He will help you.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami\\
