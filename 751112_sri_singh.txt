Dear Sri Singh,

I am in due receipt of your letter from Imphal, Manipur dated August 18, 1975 forwarded to me by my disciple Dr. Svarupa Damodara das. I am prepared to go to Manipur with some of my European and Indian disciples some time in April, 1976. I have written to Sri. N. Tombi Singh in New Delhi as per your instructions. Please find enclosed copy of letter.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Sincerely yours,

A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
