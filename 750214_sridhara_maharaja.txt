====== Letter to: Sridhara Maharaja ======

__Personal__

My dear Sripada Sridhara Maharaja,

Please accept my humble obeisances at your lotus feet. I thank you very much for your kind letter dated 1-1-1975 and I have noted the contents with great pleasure. I left India on the 26th January from Bombay and I went to Hong Kong and Tokyo. Then I went to Hawaii and I received your letter there. Then I went to Los Angeles. Now I am staying at our Mexico City temple at the address below. Here the Mexicans are taking part in sankirtana and Deity worship very nicely. They have become very good devotees. In the neighboring countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Trinidad and the Dominican Republic we have also got our temples. So, I am touring in these temples to see how things are going on, and by the grace of Krishna, everyone is becoming Krishna Conscious.

I shall be reaching India by the 15th of March and by the 20th of March, I shall be in Calcutta. If possible, Sriman Govinda may see me in Calcutta in our temple at 3 Albert Road, near Camac St. off of Theater road. At that time, I may be informed about your health and then I shall do the needful. As you have mentioned in your letter under reply that you cannot take any active part in executing the performances, I have asked my assistants in Vrndavana to take help from the local panditas in Vrndavana to do the needful. I have asked them to invite all different categories of saintly persons and devotees to take part in the ceremony. I am very much thankful to your Holiness for your good wishes in the matter of my preaching work. Factually, it is all being done by the grace of Prabhupada and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, otherwise it was not possible. Srila Prabhupada was very much fond of publishing books and he especially advised me to preach in English language. So, by his blessings, we have now about 30 big books of 400 pages and more than 20 small booklets in English and all of these books and booklets are being translated into French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Swahili, Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Italian, etc.

Thanking you once again for your kind letter and more when we meet.

Yours affectionately,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Svami\\
