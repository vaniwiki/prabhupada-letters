====== Letter to: Kapoorji ======

Vrindaban

My dear Kapoorji,

Please accept my blessings. I have just received your letter dated 4th April 1976. I have been away on a tour of Europe and America and upon returning to Bombay I have just gotten your letter. Therefore I have not replied sooner.

I shall be coming to Vrndavana within a short time and we can talk there.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
