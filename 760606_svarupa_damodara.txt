Atlanta

My dear Svarupa Damodara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your short note dated June 3, 1976, which was hand-delivered to me by Dr. Wolf. I won't have the opportunity to visit Atlanta on this tour, however, I shall be in New York from July 9th to July 20th. You can see me in New York if it is possible for you.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
