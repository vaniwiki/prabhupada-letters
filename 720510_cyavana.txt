My dear Cyavana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 1, 1972, along with plans. The plans are very nice. I have sent already one photo to Giriraja of our skyscraper in Los Angeles, so I want that this square building, whether as one bigger building or two square towers as you have proposed, that this type of square building be added to Govindaji's temple. Then it will be perfect. Otherwise, the round towers are too fanciful, and not so much practical because square building gives us more space to utilize. One other thing is that there should be a facade on top of the temple across the front like an ornamental arch, as below:

Otherwise, it is very nice and I approve completely, now work very nicely to finish it in short time and I shall come there to live.

Regarding shortage of living space, you may build another such temporary living quarters on top of that other cement foundation. You can spare one room on this foundation for Indira, she wanted to live with us.

Our point is that in the house or skyscraper we shall simply accommodate for occupants either guests or purchasers. So these purchasers must be a devotee, that is, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat or fish, like that. There are many families in Bombay, they want such association, to live with us, attend arati, prasada. This is a very important item. As soon as you get sanction, you can raise funds. People will be willing to pay in advance. In this connection, Indira has promised to help. You may send me her address and I shall write to her in this matter. Take her as one of our persons, she will be of tremendous help.

So far Vrindaban plan, it is also very nice, have you sent copy to Gurudasa in Vrindaban? If not, do so immediately. They have already got one architect to design something, but if they like, they can use your plan or combine them. Gurudasa and Ksirodakasayi will do everything there, so you need not bother about supervising yourselves.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
