My dear Kirtida Kanyaka,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for the Tulasi leaves offered to Lord Caitanya's lotus feet. If one is fortunate enough to receive such holy prasadam then all sinful reactions are immediately purified within the heart and pure devotional service is very easily obtained.

I understand that you are especially devoted to the care of Tulasi devi. Formerly our Govinda dasi introduced this Tulasi worship to our Society and I was very much pleased to see it. Now she has temporarily gone away so you must take charge of caring for Tulasi devi in Hawaii. The more you devote yourself to her service, the more you will understand and relish Krsna Consciousness.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
