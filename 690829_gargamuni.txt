My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated August 23rd, 1969 with enclosures. I am sending herewith the copy of the letter addressed to Indo Crafter, giving them a trial order. You can immediately transfer 400 dollars to my savings bank account, The Bank of Baroda, Chandni Chowk, Delhi-6, and upon hearing from you I shall send necessary instructions to the bank.

You have ordered through Acyutananda for supply of wooden mrdangas. This is all right, and we shall see which quality is better. I have also asked Mr. Dhadial to send me samples of Hare Krishna chaddars and kurtas. On receipt of these samples I shall advise you further. I am enclosing herewith back the letters of Bina Musician Stores and Indo Crafter. Keep them carefully in your files.

I have heard nothing about the activities of Los Angeles temple. Also, I am anxious to know if you have contacted the Silverman Real Estate Company for the house we saw in Beverly Hills. Both our typewriter and dictaphone are useless here because the electric current is different. We have therefore hired another set for working. I shall be glad to hear from you again along with Tamala Krishna's letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
