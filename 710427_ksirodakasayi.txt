Delhi

My dear Ksirodakasayi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21st April, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. I am so glad to hear how nicely things are developing there in Delhi. You are working so nicely. Krishna will surely help you. So do things nicely, as everything is becoming so favorable. We are getting land. And as soon as we get it, we shall make a huge function like Cross Maidan in Bombay. Such function is now being arranged in Calcutta and will be held from 14th to 24th, May.

So far as your going to Russia, you should not take interest in this Russian program. Your presence in Delhi is absolutely required. If the Russian invitation comes, then I shall go alone with an assistant. But your service is very much needed in Delhi. All the proper arrangements are being made for the Russian tour and we are expecting the invitation very soon.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
