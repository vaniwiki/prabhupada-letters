My dear SubhaVilasa,

Please accept my blessings. I received your letter and I gave it to my secretary with instructions to reply it.

Anyway, all blessings upon you for securing this church. Krishna will certainly be pleased upon you. Now you and your good wife are both initiated, chant faithfully 16 rounds daily, and follow the four regulative principles. This will insure your spiritual perfection.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
