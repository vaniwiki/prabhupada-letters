My dear Bhaja Hari das and Mukunda das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 18th February, 1976.

Yes, Harikesa Maharaja can do nicely there. I do not know the program in Hungary, but London speaking is more important, going to the colleges and universities. I am confident that he can speak well. He may read more books and preach, now he is a sannyasa.

The bus programme is a good idea.

Yes, any lease may be submitted to me for approval.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
