My dear Bhurijana,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated 16th January, 1976 along with the enclosed donation. Unless there is loving feeling, how is it possible for you to always make offerings to me? The spiritual master is always instructing his disciples and they in turn are always trying to serve their spiritual master. It is a reciprocal relationship of love.

Naturally your daughter is chanting the transcendental Name of the Lord. It must be so, because unless one is pious in previous life, one cannot take birth in a Vaisnava family. Give her good chance to become Krishna Conscious more and more, and offer my blessings to your good wife Jagatarini.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
