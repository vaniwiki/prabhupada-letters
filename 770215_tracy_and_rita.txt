Dear Tracy and Rita,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your note and thank you for your contribution. Continue chanting and associating with devotees and your spiritual growth will be assured. In this way, be happy, that is my blessing. I want to see the whole world happy in this way - that is my only ambition.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
