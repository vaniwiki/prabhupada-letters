My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I hope you are doing well. I was expecting your arrival here every moment.

Anyway, if you come during the Rathayatra festival in San Francisco it will be a great pleasure for me. Brahmananda is also coming. So we shall have to chalk out the future program of our activities. So your presence will be very much appreciated.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
