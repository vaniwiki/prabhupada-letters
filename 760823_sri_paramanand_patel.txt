Rajnandjaon M.P.

Dear Sri Paramanand Patel,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 16 August 1976 and have noted the contents with care. I have already left Bombay and I presently am at my Hyderabad center, leaving for Delhi on the 25th of August. I shall remain there up to September 2nd or 3rd and then we shall go to Vrndavana. The distance from Delhi to Vrndavana is not very much. By car it is two and a half hours and by bus it is four hours.

So if you come timely in Delhi that is all right, otherwise you have to come via Delhi to Vrndavana. So do the needful and in the meantime I hope you are in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
