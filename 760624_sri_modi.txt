Bhaktivedanta Manor

Dear Sri Modi,

Please accept my greetings. It would give me great pleasure if we could meet together when I am next in London. I am scheduled to be in London from July 20th up to July 26th, 1976. You can contact my secretary, Sriman Jayatirtha das Adhikari at the Bhaktivedanta Manor for details. Looking forward to seeing you then.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
