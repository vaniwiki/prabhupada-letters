====== Letter to: Satsvarupa ======

Los Angeles

My dear Satsvarupa das Gosvami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 10, 1975 and have noted the contents. Krsna will guide you how to increase the library distribution. Do not worry. Just do it sincerely and with a cool brain. Regarding Miami temple, you say it is a paradise. So that must be because it must be better than the former place. But they must keep the whole temple site very neat and clean. This is very important and please instruct them on this. Abhirama, he is an intelligent boy. He can do and he can manage. Simply you have to encourage him and see that he shows good example to all the devotees and they will all work very enthusiastically under his leadership.

Regarding Denver, why are they doing business? This creates a bad atmosphere. We shall only do one business and that is book-selling. That's all. As soon as you become karmis after business, then spiritual life becomes damaged. This business should not be encouraged any more. Doing business and not sankirtana, this is not at all good. Visaya chadiya kabe suddha ha'be mana/ kabe hama herabo sri-vrndavana. "When the mind is completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires, then I shall be able to understand Vrndavana and the conjugal love of Radha and Krsna, and then my spiritual life will be successful." One has to engage himself in devotional service, giving up the engagement of manufacturing pounds, shilling, pence. Sankirtana is very good, but grhasthas under condition can do other business, only if they give at least 50%, but sankirtana is the best business. Our Denver temple is situated in a very nice place. It is our own house, so it must be managed very nicely. Please encourage Kurusrestha in this regard. He is very good devotee, very sincere and intelligent.

I have seen the photograph you sent of the Houston temple. It is very impressive building. It looks like a secretariat building. I want that our Mayapur festival there should be booths showing our activities. There should be one booth showing all the photographs of our temple buildings. This will be very impressive. Even big, big businessmen, they haven't got such branches all over the world as we have got. And our business is with honor. Why not purchase the Houston temple? And I am glad to note the successful program in Gainesville temple.

Regarding the Africa preaching, in South Africa it was very successful. Although they do not like Indians there very much, still in the university when I spoke, all the European audience, they clapped after and then they purchased my books very enthusiastically. It was very encouraging. Anyone who is not biased and fanatically sophisticated will like our books. Yes, I am doing Srimad-Bhagavatam, trying to finish. I am trying my best.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
