My dear Gurudasa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 19 January, 1970.

Yes. By the grace of Krishna, Gargamuni and others here are taking particular care of me and I am very much indebted to you all; not only here, where ever I go the same care is taken of me. Gargamuni is paying very exorbitant rent for the house where I am living now. It is $600 although the house is very comfortable and silent. But still so much rent I consider a luxury for me.

I am so much pleased to learn that your London Yatra activities are expanding and that Ksirodakasayi is very sincerely cooperating. Please offer my thanks and blessings for such cooperation.

Next year he has a proposal that he will take 40 of our select devotees from London to India in February, 1971. I am very much anxious for that trip. In that trip we shall travel all over India with Sankirtana Party and thereby we will recruit many Indian sympathizers for this movement.

I think at that time we will make our program in such a way that in the month of March we shall lay down the foundation stone of our center at the birthsite of Lord Caitanya. So along with your other activities, you should prepare yourself for that purpose.

In the meantime, I am trying to purchase a plot of land there at the cost of somewhere near $3000. We have got about 22 branches and on the average everyone should contribute $150 for this purpose immediately. Big branches should contribute at least $200.

It is so satisfactory to understand that you are preaching from house to house recruiting members for our London center. This was the procedure of Lord Caitanya and Nityananda when they began preaching. I think the charity box system will be very nice success especially from the Indian store owners.

The manager of the airplane company offered us some place in Bombay, but you have not written anything about it. Is he serious about this?

You prepare now all kinds of nice films as far as possible and ask L.A. also to do this and other centers if possible, so when we go to India they will be very much appreciated.

I am so glad to learn that Cintamani song is going to be recorded in cooperation with George. Regarding George's money for my __Krishna__ Book, I have not received any news from Brahmananda.*

Please send me Mr. Benarse's address in India.

The Krishna Consciousness Society will never experience any poverty stricken life because the members are so rich being constantly in association with Krishna; that while others may feel the pinching scarcity enforced by Maya, Krishna Conscious persons will feel the whole world full of enjoyment.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

*Yes thanks we have received the check Brahmananda phoned.
