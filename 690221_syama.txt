====== Letter to: Syama ======

My dear Syama Dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated February 10, and February 16, 1969, and I thank you so much for them. Regarding the ailments with your finger, I am describing here a treatment for it. Take turmeric powder and add the same quantity of limestone. Then mix with water and boil it to a paste. Then apply that paste while it is hot. I understand that Hayagriva had some backache so for him you take one part of a crushed to a powder red-pepper and add to it five parts of rubbing alcohol. Keep this for twenty four hours, then strain and add one part camphor. When it is mixed, just apply it on the painful part of the back three times daily.

Regarding your next two questions, you may not put the initiation beads on the cow. Nor is it necessary for grhasthas to recite the Gayatri Mantra aloud. It should be silent or whispered. I think that the symbol which you have seen by the left arm of Lord Jagannatha must be either a flower or a disc.

The translation of the Om Ajnana prayer is "I offer my respectful obeisances unto my Spiritual Master who has opened my eyes from the darkness of ignorance with the torchlight of knowledge."

Please convey my blessings to Hrsikesa and Ranadhira. I hope this will meet you all in very good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
