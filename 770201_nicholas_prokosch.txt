Dear Nicholas Prokosch,

Please accept my greetings. I have received your recent letter and I am glad that you are associating with the devotees at Schloss Rettershof.

You are a sanskrit student so you can appreciate the Bhagavad-gita As It Is in all its scholarly aspects. Dr. Radhakrishnan, however is only speculation, and does not actually understand. Like so many others, he didn't know what the Gita is, and he has misused it for his own purpose. If you read the Bhagavad-gita as it is, without interpretation you can be benefitted. Read our Preface to the gita and you will understand the whole situation.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
