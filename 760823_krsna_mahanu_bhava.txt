====== Letter to: Krsna Mahanu Bhava ======

Hyderabad

Dear Krsna das Mahanu Bhava,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your kind offering of books and daksina. May you be blessed by Lord Krishna so that you may become His pure devotee. I do not know Marathi but I appreciated the books very much.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
