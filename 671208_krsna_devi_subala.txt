My dear Krishna Devi and Subala das,

Please accept my blessings. I am glad to learn that you are going to re-open your Santa Fe temple. Please make it a point that once a center is opened should not be closed. I have already given charge of six temples to six boys. You and your husband must take charge of the Santa Fe center and Krishna will bestow all blessings upon you. I shall be very soon one of your guests. Hope you are all well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta, Swami
