My dear Jadurani,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7th February 1967 and have carefully noted the contents. May krishna be pleased on you more and more for your sincere service. As you are good artist so also you write good hand. Accept Krishna as your husband and He will never cheat you. He is competent to maintain any number of wife with full comforts because He is Omnipotent. So remain busy in the service of your Husband and you will be happy in this life as well as in the next. May Krishna award with His all benedictions upon you.

Yours ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
