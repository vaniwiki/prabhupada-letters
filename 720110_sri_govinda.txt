East Cleveland

My dear Sri Govinda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 12, 1971, and I am very much pleased by the enclosed pictures of your new Cleveland, Ohio, center. It is most respectable-looking and elegant, and I am very very glad to see that you have got such a nice place to conduct Krishna's business and to keep Radha and Krishna very excellently by providing them fully with nice prasadam, flowers, ornaments, etc. I think that if you order nice deities from our devotees in Jaipur that They will very much enjoy to live there, and then you can give Them all good attention befitting such nice house.

I am very encouraged that all aspects of your KC program are increasing under your supervision, and I have especially appreciate prominent Indian gentleman as examples of our propaganda work. Just go on printing such leaflets, as Karandhara is also doing in Los Angeles, and everyone will take one and get some solid information about Krishna. You may print small essays also in this way. I am pleased that your distribution of literatures is also increasing. Go on giving this matter your full attention. The more books we sell, the more we ourselves advance in Krishna Consciousness.

Regarding your proposal to open one store, that is not a very good proposal. Our devotees cannot work in that way. Better they are preaching and selling books door-to-door. That man simply wants to take our men for nothing, create some trouble, then drive us away. This has been our experience. If the man wants to open such store and without us working give us some profit, that is all right.

I think I shall be very comfortable in your Cleveland center when I shall come there very soon. I hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
