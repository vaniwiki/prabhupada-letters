My dear Sukadev,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 30, 1976.

So far your question as to whether it is more important to organize the women's book distribution or to work on College preaching, the book distribution is more important.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
