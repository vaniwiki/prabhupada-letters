My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 6, 1969 and the new issue of __BTG.__ I am pleased to learn that the house transaction is finished, and I shall be glad if you send a copy of the conveyance deed to the London address, where I am going the day after tomorrow. The purchasing transaction has been done on Janmastami Day, and this is also a great occasion. Regarding your anxieties how to pay the rent, etc., in the winter season, I think Krishna will provide with sufficient press work and some of the boys may work also. In this way we have to manage. Your remark that Advaita may have to do a lot of commercial work to help the temple during the winter is right. Whenever there is spare time we can earn money by outside work. We shall fully utilize the press facilities in various ways. My suggestion to meet the business men is to convince responsible men of your country to understand the importance of this Krishna Consciousness Movement and how we are molding the character of younger generation by giving them peaceful home, philosophy of life, artistic sense, musical entertainment, nutritious foods: and above all these, we are giving them spiritual enlightenment, which is never to be found elsewhere throughout the whole world. Every gentleman in your country is anxious about their children, and gradually if the richer section of the people or the government cooperates with us, we can expand this movement for total welfare of the younger generation. This calculation is only one side of the picture: The other side of the picture means the solution of the eternal problem. Even though people in general may not be able to understand it, the fact is there. So in winter season this propaganda may be done. Some very responsible man may be selected to preside over a meeting, either in the temple or in some rented private hall, if the meeting is to be very big. In this way we can try to invite the so-called important people of the society and try to convince them about the importance of this movement.

Regarding the outlaws, why police protection is not there? Does it mean that in the United States if somebody is threatened, he will have no state protection and must submit to the atrocities of the outlaws? Our point should be that we shall take all necessary steps for self-protection, depending the result on Krishna. We should not idly sit down simply depending on Krishna. Arjuna had to fight in the battlefield, but at the same time he heard __Bhagavad-gita.__ Our motto shall be like that. Neither we shall fight alone, without Krishna Consciousness, nor we shall give up all possible facilities in Krishna Consciousness.

Regarding BTG no. 27, it is nicely done, but there is no mention of the words "Back To Godhead" on each page. Why this mistake has been done? Besides that, some of the headings, like "Parts and Parcels," are not very prominent, while at the same time there are many places where empty space is found. If some space is available, the heading should be broader. Henceforward, we shall try to avoid the Beatles or hippy's articles, because they have no spiritual importance.

Yes, I have received the Vyasa Puja book in due time, and it is very nicely set up. Yes, the date was wrong, but it doesn't matter. It has come out timely: that is excellent. Regarding introduction to __Isopanisad,__ please let me know the deadline for me to send it. Don't bother about the items I asked you to send with Hayagriva. I have instructed Hayagriva to work as co-editor with Satsvarupa, and he is now completely a surrendered soul. So conjointly make the appearance of BTG very nicely. The front cover page should be a nicely painted picture. You write that Jadurani is now painting wonderful pictures, so pictures by either Jadurani, Muralidhara or Devahuti should be given on the front page. The present front page picture is not very attractive as they were in last issues. A first class picture should always be given on the front page.

I thank you very much for your appreciation of my book, __Krishna,__ and you all enjoyed it on Janmastami Day. You write to say that each book I write is greater than anything written previously, but I must also inform you that each book you print is nicer than the previous printing. Two books, __Bhagavad-gita As It Is__ and __TLC,__ both are practically done by you, and the __TLC__ has come out in printing art better than __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ Similarly, I hope when you will print __Nectar of Devotion__ and __Krishna__ in our own press, it will come out better than __TLC.__ So I will give you better writing and you will produce better books. In this way there will be competition in the service of Krishna. That is very nice. On the whole, I am very much pleased with the getup of TLC, and I hope in the future all our books may be printed at least to that standard. I am very much encouraged to learn that Jadurani is painting very nice pictures, and all of them can be utilized one after another to come out on the front page of BTG. Later on, when we print __Krishna,__ they will come together. In issue No. 27, the marriage pictures have come out super-excellent. They will give nice teachings to the people of your country how we are harnessing the confused younger generations under the protection of Lord Visnu. Uddhava has also written a very good article, and I appreciate this very much.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
