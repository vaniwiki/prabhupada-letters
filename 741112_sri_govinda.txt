My dear Sri Govinda dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 17, 1974 and have noted the contents. I am glad to know that you are cooperating with Jagadisa Prabhu for rectifying the difficulties there. I have received report that you have repaid debts of Dollars 35,000.00, so this is very nice. So continue in this way. I want that all our centers be nicely managed so I can be freed for translation work without any anxiety. Therefore I have created the GBC to take this responsibility.

Simply by maintaining the Krsna conscious standards, everything else will follow. So I have faith in you. I know you are a good worker. Krsna has given you very nice place there in Chicago. So utilize it nicely, and I will be very much pleased.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
