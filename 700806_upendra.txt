My dear Upendra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in receipt of your letter dated August 4, 1970 and have examined the contents. A reply to your last letter was previously sent.

Now all my disciples must work combinedly and with cooperation to spread this Sankirtana Movement. If you cannot work together then my work is stopped up. Our Society is like one big family and our relationships should be based on love and trust. We must give up the fighting spirit and use our intelligence to push ahead. You should accept help from your Godbrothers.

Now I have set up the Governing Body Commission to handle management, questions of philosophy, and personal problems. These things are too much botheration for me, I simply want time to write books to satisfy my Guru Maharaja. If Balimardan Prabhu has gone to open still another Temple that is certainly good news. Kindly remain there and teach Upananda das by nice example and work together with the devotees there. If we work hard for Krsna without personal consideration or ambition, then we are assured of success.

Tomorrow I am leaving for Hawaii on the way to Japan. After some time our Sankirtana Party, including five of my disciples, will go on to preach in India. Meanwhile, kindly push on our Sankirtana program and distribute as much literature and prasada as possible.

I hope this reply finds you in good mood.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
