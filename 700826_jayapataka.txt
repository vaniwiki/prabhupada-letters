My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your Vyasa Pujah Homage Telegram reading as follows received yesterday morning!

"(Vyasa puja Poetry) to save the world

And serve the Lord He left His home

And His children too

Two children lost some thousands gained,

Krishna's mercy received in

Party splint a stumbling block

With world God-Consciousness

The aim His Divine Grace bridges

The gap to bless the world with Gauraprema,

Jayapataka's life is not his own

It's Prabhupada's to do with as His own"

I feel very much obliged to you for your nice understanding about my mission. Your offer of service to the cause of our Lord is also welcomed. I hope in future you shall be of great help in my mission and I can count upon. More when we meet. We are seven starting on Saturday including one Japanese nice boy.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. I have received no letter from you to Tokyo-address.
