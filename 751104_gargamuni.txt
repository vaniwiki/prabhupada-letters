My dear Gargamuni Swami

Please accept my blessings. Now after consideration it is my desire that you return to take over Calcutta affairs. Otherwise things are not at all going on nicely there. You are experienced man for Calcutta. I do not wish to see things deteriorating there. It is important center, and you have proven that you can manage things nicely, so why you should not be there? I want you to go there immediately. This is more important responsibility. Gopala Krishna also agrees with my desire, so you should go there. You can apply for one year entry visa. Say that you are a member of ISKCON and you are going to India to study Vedic culture and languages and Deity worship in our temples in India. Apply immediately because Gopala Krishna says it may take 6-8 weeks for the visa to be granted.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
