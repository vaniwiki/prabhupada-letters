My dear Laksmimoni devi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 21, 1975 with enclosed photo. Generally it is not good for the women with babies to worship the Deity, because a baby means uncleanliness. You have to touch the baby and there is so many dirtiness, so how can you remain sanctified? But if you are doing it nicely, then it is okay. But, if you have to take care of the baby, then it is not good.

Why is Nandarani not taking care of the Deity?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
