====== Letter to: Rayarama ======

New York

My dear Rayarama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 28, 1968, and I thank you very much for it. I am pleased to hear that you are devoting yourself to the work on Back To Godhead, and it is all right by me if you discontinue the articles on Haridasa Thakura by Professor Sannyal. I know it is difficult to read because it is so presented in a scholarly manner, therefore it was not very much sold.

There is no need of sending the Isopanisad here; I shall be in N.Y. in 2 weeks, we can discuss it at that time.

So far my name is concerned, there is no need of adding Tridandi Goswami, but simply have it as A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, as it is already done in my other books, it will be continued. I made the title page sent herewith, and you will see it. You have to make the contents page for TLC. I have not got any copy of the book, neither it is possible to mark page numbers until we get press copy from the printer. But table of contents page is necessary, so please see to it. I do not like for __Sri__ Bhaktivedanta Swami, __A.C.__ Bhaktivedanta Swami is shorter, and nicer.

Hoping you are well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
