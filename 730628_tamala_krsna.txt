====== Letter to: Tamala Krsna ======

Bombay

My dear Tamala Krsna Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. Please let me know how much you have deposited in the BBT account since you have taken a loan of 1 lac 50,000 on the Mayapur scheme. I have advised Gargamuni Maharaja to deposit part of his collection to the BBT account against the loan. The BBT is in the Gwalior Tank Road Branch, Central Bank of India, but Gargamuni Maharaja says you have opened another account in the Indian Overseas Marine Lines. Please let me know what is this idea? I never knew of it. Your early reply will be much appreciated.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
