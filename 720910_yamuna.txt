Vrindaban

My dear Yamuna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated August 20, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. I am very happy to hear that you are having nice programs in Vrindaban of kirtana and lecturing in various places. That will make us well-known in those parts and respected by everyone. I am glad to hear also that you have made my rooms very nicely painted and cleansed. Now I shall be coming there by early October and I want to stay in those rooms, so you may prepare them for me very nicely and decorate with flowers, etc. I think that Tamala Krsna, Bhavananda, and Subala have returned to Vrindaban for assisting Gurudasa in the construction work and for helping Tejiyas to organize the Delhi Pandal program, so you may host them very nicely and see to their all comforts and facilities for swiftly working on these programs.

I have sent up two sets of Saurabha's plans to Gurudasa in Vrindaban. Did he get them? Either one of these plans is just suitable for our purpose, so you may get them approved immediately and begin the work. I want to see something tangible by the time I reach.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
