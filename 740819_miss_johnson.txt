Dear Miss Johnson,

Thank you for your letter dated July 15th 1974. Regarding the lecture that I gave at the Rathayatra festival, I think if you contact our San Francisco temple, they might be able to provide you with a transcript. If you speak with the president there Bhakta dasa, he may be able to suggest ways that you can use your public relations in the service of Krishna. First of all you should get our books and read them, especially our Bhagavad gita as it is and Srimad-Bhagavatam. As you begin to understand the philosophy then you will be able to present our movement so that many people may become attracted to this authorized process for developing our dormant love of God.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
