My dear Giriraja das:

Please accept my blessings. Gargamuni Swami has returned with copies of letters from the BMC architect, the Bandra Asst. Engineer, and the letter regarding the land acquisition. Regarding the property evaluation, I have already written you how we have paid Rs. 200/- per sq. yard. From the developed portion we are receiving income per annum of Rs. 18,000/- including the tax deductions. The current rate of interest for an investment is 10%, so the value for this portion is Rs. 1,80,000/-. For the entire land we have paid Rs. 14,50,00/-; so the value for the undeveloped portion is Rs. 12,70,000/- (for 6,000 sq. yards) or Rs. 200/- per sq. yard. If they are calculating the value at Rs. 130/- per sq. yard, then we have paid more than the market value, not less.

Regarding the road, you must immediately install at the front of the road a permanent iron gate, like the one on the opposite property, with one dharwan or guard. This is very important and must be done immediately. No tenant will be allowed for any reason to park his car on any part of the road. You can make one parking place for their cars on the portion of land opposite the well next to the block where my old flat was where the during the pandal there was the kitchen. But, no trees should be torn down. The tenants can pay something for the parking facilities. You should also make a formal request for increasing the rent of all tenants for the cost of the internal road, otherwise where will the cost of the road come from? I think we can enhance the rent for road improvement. If necessary, you can engage one lawyer for doing all these things, if Mr. Asanani is not helping.

Regarding the construction, you should immediately begin work on all four of the remaining flats. The work must begin whether you have got sufficient cement or bricks. If you have to lay only one brick, then do that. I may be coming there next week, so you can prepare for that.

Regarding distributing the books to all centers, they must pay for whatever they order, even if they order less. If they do not pay cash, then do not fill the order. Regarding their old debts, let them pay whatever they can. But, for what they order, they must pay for. You can ship them whatever way, transporter or whatnot, but it must be COD.

I understand that Manasvi has returned, but he should not be given any responsibility, nothing.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
