====== Letter to: Gopala Krsna ======

Bombay

My dear Gopala Krsna Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram from New Delhi relating the latest victories of the BBT Library Party.

I have requested Radhavallabha in Los Angeles to send you all the transparencies for printing the color pictures in all of our books. So you can proceed to print all of the books and distribute them profusely. These standing orders need standing respect. So print these books in India using the government paper and see that there is good supply of books to all of our distributers throughout India.

Now, Yasodanandana Swami is going to print some of the small and medium size books for his distribution in South India, so you can supply him with the transparencies and he can return them in good condition to you after he has no more use for them.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
