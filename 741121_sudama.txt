My dear Sudamadas Goswami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 6, 1974 and I am glad to note that you are now moved into your new quarters. So I shall be coming in December. The tickets may be sent as follows: Five open dated tickets on Pan American BOMBAY/CALCUTTA/HONG KONG/TOKYO/ HONOLULU.

The Ganesa puja may not be performed. No, it is not to be done. No need of it.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
