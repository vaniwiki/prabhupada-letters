My dear devotees,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter. I thank you very much for the package containing the woolen slippers and the nice bag for the karatalas. They are very nicely done. Regarding the baby Acarya das, yes, the name is approved by me and it is a very nice thing that he was born with umbilical cord wrapped like sacred thread. I am very pleased to hear about the book distribution. I know that Atlanta is very good place for book distribution and you are doing it nicely. So please continue.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
