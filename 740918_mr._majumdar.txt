Dear Mr. Majumdar:

I am in due receipt of your in Bengali dated 5/9/74 and beg to inform you that at present I am very sick. The subject matter you have inquired from me is very grave and cannot be replied haphazardly. It appears you have no deep study in the matter, and if you are serious about it you have to live with us for some time to understand.

As a summary study I may inform you that human life must lead to God realization. Without God realization there is no difference between human life and animal life. All the Vedic literature is aimed at making human life a success by God realization. In this age that God realization is made very easy by chanting the holy names, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has very kindly introduced this method 500 years ago, and it has proved a very potent and active process. God being absolute, His holy names, form, pastimes, etc., are not different from Him. So this requires deep study and understanding, otherwise it is very difficult to understand.

I have got my program to go to Calcutta by the end of the month. At that time you can try to meet me. But unless you intimately associate yourself with the devotees in this connection, it will be very difficult for you to understand the whole procedure.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
