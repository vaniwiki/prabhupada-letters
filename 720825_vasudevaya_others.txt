East Cleveland

My dear Vasudevaya dasi and others,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Cleveland dated August 5, 1972 duly forwarded to me from Calcutta, and I thank you very much. As long as you are following our Krishna Conscious principles I have no objection if you remain separate from the other devotees in the Cleveland Center. I have instructed Satsvarupa who is the GBC man for Midwestern USA Zone to come and visit you to see how the things are going on and give you good guidance how to keep the highest standards of Krishna Consciousness Movement. If you have any further questions or if you require anything like mrdangas, books, etc. he will give you everything. I am enclosing the copy of one letter to him in this respect.

Hoping this meets you all in the best of health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
