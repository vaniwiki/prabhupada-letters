Dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of BBT trustee's report dated February 13, 1976.

Regarding the devotees coming to Mayapur-Vrindaban, I would have liked they come all at least once in a year, so let the other trustees consider. If they come once every five years, then it will be five years vacant. the installment plan is better.

Jayatirtha is experienced; he is very good at negotiations. It is nice that he be retained as consultant/negotiator. The others are neophyte; sometimes they are cheated. George Harrison was cheated 20,000 pounds by reality men.

I have asked several times that you send a copy of the transfer slip when you transfer money to Bombay. You must send it regularly, whenever you transfer. What is the use of Radha-Damodara monies going to Los Angeles; he is sending direct. He will send and you can note.

It is good that the philosophy book is being arranged properly by Hayagriva.

Regarding the BBT book catalog and Mailorder catalogs, do not mention the commission. That will be settled up by the sellers.

Sudama Vipra Maharaja is here and he has advised me that he will order 10,000 Bhagavad-gitas, abridged edition. You can give him concession rate as far as possible and he will pay cash down something.

Please advise Mailorder to send one or two copies of their new catalogs to me.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
