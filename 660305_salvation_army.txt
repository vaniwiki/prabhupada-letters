Dear Sir,

I beg to inform you that I am a Vaisnava Sannyasi and I have come from India (Vrindaban U.P.) for establishing a preaching centre in America for the first time in the study of Srimad-Bhagavatam. A small literature in this connection is sent herewith for your kind perusal. This Srimad-Bhagavatam is the post graduate study of the Bhagavad-gita and both of them are sciences of Theism. I am seeking your good cooperation in this attempt for developing higher sense of God consciousness.

I have got money in India and I wanted to get it from India for starting the above centre but the Government of India has no dollar exchange to pay in America and therefore I have been handicapped in this attempt. My correspondence with the Prime Minister as well as my devotee Sir Padampat Singhania is complete. The latest replies and their copies are also sent herewith for your perusal.

I know that you have a great number of centres in India for your missionary work and you spend many thousands of American money in India for your noble activities. If you therefore accept my money in India for spending there and pay me in dollars here in America for my spending here, it will be a great cooperation.

I think we should cooperate in every respects in the matter of raising peoples sense of God consciousness in these days of forgetfulness.

I am in need of $200,000.00 two hundred thousands of dollars immediately for starting my centre here in New York. If you help me by this amount in exchange of my money in India, it will be considered a Grace of the Lord.

Thanking you in anticipation for an early reply,

Yours sincerely in the service of the Lord,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.\\
