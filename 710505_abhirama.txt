My dear Abhirama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated April 23 and have noted the contents. I am very glad to know that one new brahmacarini has donated $15,000 and a new car. My thanks to her and she will be initiated as soon as you recommend. So far as distributing the fifteen thousand dollars, I would advise you to send this money to ISKCON PRESS for printing Bhagavad-gita As It Is enlarged edition. They require about $20,000 out of which I have asked Karandhara Prabhu to send them $5,000 from the Book Fund. Similarly, if Lyndan Prabhu can contribute $15,000 then the present problem of printing this book is solved. So if you can kindly let me know your decision to Calcutta address, 3 Albert Road, Calcutta-17.

Regarding the new car, I think we require some new cars in India. So if it is possible, the car may be dispatched to India. We have already applied to the Import Department Govt. of India and are expecting a reply soon. So if it is possible send the car to India.

So far as your wife is concerned you must be very careful. They are previously two miscarriages, so it is to be understood that she is diseased. A medical practitioner or gynecologist should be consulted in this connection.

I shall be very soon coming to USA. After finishing this Australian and Far East business I shall return to Calcutta and probably I shall have to go to Russia. If not I shall be going to London, and from London to U.S.A. This is our present program. I hope this will meet you in good health and thank you once more for your letter. One thing I don't see is your letter heading. Formerly there was a letter heading. You should always use stationery letter heading. That is required.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
