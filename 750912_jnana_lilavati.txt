My dear Jnana das and Lilavati devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letters dated August 20, 1975 and have noted the contents. So I think that you are both very well suited for preaching in Africa. If you continue as you are now doing by the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu you will be very successful. It is by His order that we are carrying this message all over the world. Do not neglect chanting Hare Krishna.

Cyavana Swami is submitting very good reports of your activities. Now I am coming there to Africa, and shall see you then.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
