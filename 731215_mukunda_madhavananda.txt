My dear Mukunda and Madhavananda,

Please accept my blessings. Enclosed find one letter I just received from Jaya Laksmana das. We want to utilize our land there for raising flowers, vegetables and grains if possible. Jaya Laksmana's suggestions are welcome so please give him all encouragement and facility. Work together cooperatively and develop things nicely there.

Hare Krsna. I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
