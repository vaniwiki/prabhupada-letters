My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg acknowledge receipt of your letters dated April 10 and April 18, 1972, and I have noted the contents. It is better to forget past incidents, whatever is done is done. Let us look forward to correcting our mistakes. So far you are concerned, I am very much convinced of your sincere service. I am especially glad that the school Gurukula is improving more and more in its standard under your management. That is our real work, to educate people in spiritual life by giving them the practical example, so I wanted that the GBC would be a chosen body of men for that purpose, to see how the students are learning and reporting to me as my secretaries. I do not know how you could have missed these points, as they are clearly spelled out in my original constitution. Anyway, whatever is done, is done. So I am very glad that you are leading all others in book distribution, so you go on with your work in this way and Krishna will give you all the clear idea of how to do everything.

Now Kirtanananda has bought me one bus, so now I am taking with me wherever I go three assistants, so my translating work is not stopped even while traveling, so I may continue to tour sometimes and my work will go on, therefore I shall certainly come to Dallas sometime after my coming back to USA.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
