My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27th March, 1970, and have noted the contents. In the meantime, I have received your letter dated 30th March, 1970, along with the two checks for $1,592.02 and $256.00. Thank you very much for them. So now when you require money for printing our books, inform me and I shall send you the check. And you may send all checks of money not expended on printing and money from book sales to me.

Regarding printing of the books, now you are managing these things in Boston. I want just that the books may be printed somehow, somewhere; that is all. So do it as you see fit, there is no need of checking with me. I give you full responsibility in the matter, but only if there is some critical point it may be referred to me.

So far the preface, dedication, acknowledgement for Nectar of Devotion, I shall supply you with these in due course of time. I do not think they are immediately required since you can print the other parts of the book first as you have decided.

Regarding a cover picture for __Krishna Consciousness-the Topmost Yoga,__ I think you can make a picture of a devotee sitting cross-legged chanting japa before Radha Krsna Deities.

I have read the letter from Raman Publications Magazine. So when you receive the copies of their publications, send them to me, and then I shall decide what to do.

I am very glad to know that both Boston and New York centers are blissfully engaged. Now just see things go on nicely.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
