Dear Raghunath,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter of April 1st, and I have noted the contents.

You have analyzed that you are distressed because you are not given an engagement in Krsna Consciousness. This observation is correct, unless we are engaged with all our senses and intelligence in serving Krsna where is the question of Krsna Consciousness? We are reading here in the evenings how in the 4th chapter of Bhagavad gita Krsna has arranged for __catur varnam,__ the social division of four orders, whereby everyone has some engagement according to his propensity, his quality and work, and thus everyone can go back to Godhead while performing their work.

You complain that as a householder it is very difficult. Especially you want to preach. There are examples of great preachers who were householders, such as Bhaktivinode thakur, although we cannot hope to imitate him. You have not mentioned whether you are attending the activities of the temple and associating with the devotees in Melbourne, and these things are essential. Madhudvisa Swami is my representative in charge of devotional affairs in Australia and if you will discuss the specific situation with him, he will see that you become engaged in work just suitable to your situation as a householder.

I will be glad to hear you have found proper service, as this is our whole secret of success. So long as you are chanting and reading our books and raising your family in Krsna Consciousness you are already engaged in the best service. Your desire to do more and preach is a sign of advancement; now confer with the devotees there and find out the best practical preaching assignment.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
