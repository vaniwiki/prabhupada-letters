My dear Puranjana das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 6th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I think your idea about having professional men do our accounting in order to assure good accounting, is a good proposal. Regarding your other points, you must discuss these things with Hansadutta.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
