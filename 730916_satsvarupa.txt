My dear Satsvarupa Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your GBC report dated Sept. 3, and have noted the contents. So far naming of the Detroit Deities, They shall be known as Radha Kunja Behari. Yes, it is proper etiquette that the sannyasis consult with the local president for anything they need such as men. Regarding the Gurukula I am glad to hear that the one 5 year old boy wanted to stay with us. That is very good. Boys like friends of the same age. Regarding sending the older boys to New Vrindaban. let New Vrindaban have sufficient place for them, then you can consider. Anyway, this will have to be decided amongst yourselves.

Yes for Deity worship at least 10 brahmanas are required. Regarding New Orleans, the book distribution must be established not just the Deity worship. This is very important to our movement, so please arrange this to go on.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
