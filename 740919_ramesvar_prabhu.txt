Dear Ramesvar Prabhu:

Please accept my humble obeisances. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 11, 1974. In response to Srila Prabhupad has asked me to write you that what you have deducted from Guru Kripa's collection should also be transferred to Bombay account immediately. BBT must pay for these things, not that it should be deducted from the money being sent here for construction.

Regarding the Dollars 7,500 Giriraj is supposed to have received, that I am enquiring from him, but in the meantime the balance, which comes to Dollars 22,490.63 should be immediately transferred to Bombay American Express account with notice by separate post informing me as such.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your servant,

Bramananda Swami

Personal Secretary
