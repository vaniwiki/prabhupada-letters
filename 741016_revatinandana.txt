My dear Revatinandana Swami

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 20, 1974 and have noted the contents. Jayatirtha was just here but did not mention that you were there. Anyway, go on with preaching to the college students there on the West Coast. Explain to them that after death they have to take another body. The body even in this life is constantly changing, and at death they change and take another body according to one's work in this life. They must know this fact. By taking to Krishna consciousness they can become purified and no longer have to take birth again in this material world where they are the four-fold miseries of the body.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Why not also consult with Satsvarupa Maharaja and take standing orders for my books like he is doing. We are getting very good reception for my books from the learned circles. This is very encouraging. Work like this within the schools and colleges.
