My dear Pusta Krishna Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 12, 1974 and have noted the contents. Regarding my travelling, no, I have not stopped travelling. I am trying to go on like a young man, but sometimes the health does not allow. That is beyond my jurisdiction. So you have finally gotten the visa for South Africa. So we are trying to get the endorsement on my passport for going to Africa here in Bombay.

I will come to South Africa. Brahmananda Swami suggests that we come after going to Australia. We shall remain in Australia up to end of February, and will be able to spare two weeks in South Africa, because I must be in India by mid March.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. We were not able to get the S.A. endorsement in Bombay in time, so we shall try for it in Australia.
