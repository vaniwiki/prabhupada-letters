My dear Gurudasa Swami:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 6, 1975 and have noted the contents. The purpose of sannyasa is that now one has no hindrances for preaching work. The purpose is to increase preaching. So if one takes sannyasa and does not increase preaching, then there is no value. So you take this opportunity seriously, and preach and inspire others to also preach. Then there will be no question of thinking of other things. This will all vanish. I have complete faith in you.

Regarding your question, we need not bother about these things now.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
