====== Letter to: Narayani ======

My dear Narayani,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated 27th May, 1971, and you will be glad to know that, upon the recommendation of Sriman Janmanjaya Prabhu, that I have accepted you as my duly initiated disciple. Your spiritual name is Narayani Devi Dasi. Narayani means the energy of Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I have also chanted on your beads and they are enclosed herewith.\\
Yes, now that you have come to Krishna Consciousness, your spiritual life, the real life, has begun. First birth is from your parents but real birth, real life, begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master and renders service onto him. Then the path is open for going back to home, back to Godhead, to live eternally in full knowledge and full bliss and in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Krishna. That is the goal, and the means to attain it are simple. You should strictly follow the regulative principles, chant at least 16 rounds of beads daily, read and study all our books, attend aratis and go for street Sankirtana, etc. In this way be engaged in Krishna's business 24 hours and your rapid advancement in Krishna Consciousness will be certain.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
