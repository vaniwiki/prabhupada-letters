San Diego

My dear Bhakta das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 28, 1972, and I am pleased to note that everything is progressing nicely in San Diego center. I especially appreciate your attitude toward increasing more and more the sales of our books, that will sanctify all other activities of preaching because preaching means selling books.

Please inform me of the result of your spending $500 for advertising for our __Krishna Book.__ If such expenditure proves successful, then we may spend thousands of dollars and make __Krishna Book__ very famous all over your country, that is, if the money invested comes back manyfold in the form of amount of books sold, by making these radio advertisements.

I am also encouraged by your going to that small town near San Diego and getting such a good result from your preaching work there. Similarly, why not go from town to town throughout your entire area, even they may be small villages only, and hold such programs. This is real Sankirtana. Also you may inform the other centers of this process of going out to the surrounding small towns on preaching missions, how to do it nicely.

Because you are making so many new devotees and distributing so many books and magazines, therefore I can understand that your routine work is being kept to the highest standard and that preaching work is going on well. This I can very much appreciate. Now never let it slacken or neglect our regular program, and always you will be successful in spreading this sublime movement of Lord Caitanya's, and very soon you will yourself approach the supreme perfection of life.

I Hope this will meet you in good health and happy mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
