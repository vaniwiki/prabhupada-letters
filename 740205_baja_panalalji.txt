My dear Baja Panalalji,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your letter dated December 28, 1973 regarding a change of plan.

I understand from different sources that you want to construct the Temple portion by your choice, so I accept the plan submitted by you in place of the original plan.

Krsna is Bhavagrahi Janardana. Krsna has many Temples big and small, besides that He has his own abode in the Spiritual Sky, Goloka Vrndavana, so all our plans are under the jurisdiction of Bhavagrahi. To serve Krsna under a certain transcendental mellow according to one's spirit of service, everything is accepted by the Lord. So your decision to improve the first plan is certainly very much appreciated by Krsna. The work will go on and further advance with your full cooperation in order that we may be able to fulfill the job as soon as possible.

I am thinking to go to Hyderabad by the end of March and certainly it would be great pleasure to me to stay under your shelter and I am looking forward to this opportunity.

Hoping this will meet you in good health and my all good wishes for all your family members and servants, and my sincere regard for you.

Thank you once again.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
