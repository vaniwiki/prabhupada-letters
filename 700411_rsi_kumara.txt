New York

My dear Rsi Kumara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 6th April, 1970, together with two checks for $1015.79 and $150 respectively and thank you very much.

New York is the best city of your country, therefore the prospect of preaching in New York City is especially very great. I began my preaching life in this city, therefore I have got some special attraction for New York. I wish, therefore, that a fitting and imposing temple may be situated in New York. I understand that you are trying your best to secure a house, so in consultation with Brahmananda you can do it very earnestly.

Regarding Sankirtana Parties in New York, Krsna will provide devotees, don't be worried. Krsna can provide anything and everything within a moment, but He waits to test a devotee. And when the devotee comes out successful from the test, He gives him all opportunity for devotional service. So everyone of you should go on with the Sankirtana Party and gradually Krsna will send more and more devotees to join you.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
