====== Letter to: Svarupa Damodara ======

Atlanta

My dear Svarupa Damodara das:

Please accept my blessings. I have read Dr. Wolf's letter addressed to you dated July 1, 1975. I think he has given you good, sane advice. I think you should not think of relinquish your job without meeting me and discussing the matter deeply. Don't do anything out of sentiment. You must make the best use of a bad bargain. Unless you keep your job, you will not be considered an important man in the material sense. And, if you are not an important man, then who will listen to you?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
