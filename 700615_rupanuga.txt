====== Letter to: Rupanuga ======

Albuquerque

My dear Rupanuga,

Please accept my blessings. Since you met with the motor accident, although I am getting your news time to time, still I was very much anxious to write you directly, but I did not know your address. This morning I have got this address.

So it was Krsna's grace that He saved you from a dangerous position. This dangerous position is dangerous if it does not go away after its appearance for a while. But if it goes away, then it is friend. A devotee's angle of vision being that everything is emanating from the Supreme, danger is not danger---that is the conclusion of Srimad-Bhagavatam. A devotee takes danger as also mercy of Krsna because in everything there is a purpose of Krsna and without His sanction nothing can take place.

Anyway, do not be worried, Krsna has saved you, and very soon you will regain strength. Your son, Sriman Ekendra, is living with us comfortably. He has now by this time overcome the shock and now he is pleasantly chanting and dancing. I hope your wife is also improving by this time. According to Bhagavad-gita we have simply to tolerate all these temporary appearances and disappearance, our main function being to make steady progress in Krsna consciousness.

Please keep me informed about your progress, and oblige.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
