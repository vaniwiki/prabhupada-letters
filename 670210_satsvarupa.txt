My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your note. Yes please send me immediately one copy of Bhakti Sutra (with original Sankrit text). I shall immediately begin the commentary. Yes you can edit on the tapes of Teachings of Lord Caitanya. I am very pleased to receive your voluntary offer. Thank you very much.
