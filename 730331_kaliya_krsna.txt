My dear Kaliya Krsna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 12th March and I have examined the contents carefully.

You have committed a very grave error. I am depending on you leaders for the future of our Society, yet there is all this interest in illicit sex life. this is causing me heartache worrying how things will go on. What can I do? I have given you all instructions, why you cannot follow them? Now you are supposed to be a responsible devotee, and this situation must be rectified, it is bad example for others. You have begged for my blessings and I give them to you because you are my spiritual son and I have taken responsibility for engaging you in the service of Krsna. But I think you can from now on follow the regulated restrictions strictly and refrain from any sex life at all, that can be your austerity.

Your proposal to go to Chicago Temple under the supervision of Satsvarupa Maharaja and Kirtanananda Maharaja is very good. They are your well-wishers. Now you may take up your activities with determination and seriousness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
