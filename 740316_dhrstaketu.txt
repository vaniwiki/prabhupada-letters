Dear Dhrstaketu,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 28, 1974 and I have examined the contents.

Yes, it is all right that you devote your time to painting instead of street sankirtana. The main thing is that you be engaged in some worthwhile work for Krsna without wasting even a moment. Unless we are constantly engaged then there will be sickness and illicit sex automatically. So there is a good need for pictures in our preaching work, especially in illustrating our books, and if you are seriously painting I have no objection to your proposal.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
