====== Letter to: Ranadhira ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ranadhira das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated March 5, 1976 along with the lists of libraries and professors who have taken standing orders. Yes, you can compile a list of all the professors who have taken at least 1 of our books and please note his address as well as the title/s of the book/s that he has taken. I thank you very much for your hard work in sending out the 200,000 Krishna Consciousness is Authorized pamphlet to leading citizens. Please continue with this important work.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
