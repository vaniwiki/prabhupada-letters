My dear Ramesvara,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 26, 1976.

If they are giving us trouble to distribute at the airports, then go to the courts. What can be done? We already have favorable decisions from some courts. We are doing something good for the whole world. Present the scholars' opinions. They have the power, we are powerless. What can be done? Depend on Krishna.

You write to say that we are getting good response from the latest issue of BTG. These testimonials should be presented in the court. Dharmadhyaksa's article is very nice. Such articles should be published. Take the psychologists opinion in writing. If somehow or other people chant, they'll be our men. So, somehow induce them to chant.

Regarding these deprogrammers, we must defeat their false accusations in the courts. We do not force anyone. They may stay or go, the freedom is there. Out of their own accord they don't want association with meat eaters, drunkards, and debauches. Just as there is warning from the government that if you steal you'll be punished. We are convincing people not to commit sinful activities or associate with sinful persons. Are these bad tactics? We are making men of good character. It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss. Even 10 year old boys are smoking, so much degraded. We are trying to convince people to become first class men rather than fifth class men. We have to fight.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
