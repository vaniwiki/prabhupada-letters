My dear Hansadutta dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 23, 1975 and have noted the contents. I approve your ideas. Yes, London is a city where we can open many centers. If possible, do it.

In Melbourne, I saw one devotee girl who looked almost exactly like Himavati. Therefore I asked about her. Yes, she is welcome here if she likes.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
