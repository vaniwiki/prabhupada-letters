My dear Dinadayadri,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 22 February, 1970, together with your beads and recommendation from Sriman Bhagavan dasa for your initiation.

I am very glad to accept you as my initiated disciple, and I have already returned your beads duly chanted upon by me. Your spiritual name is Dinadayadri Dasi. Please be very careful to follow the four basic restrictive principles of no eating of meat, fish or eggs, no taking of any kind of intoxicants, no illicit sex-life, and no gambling or mental speculations. Always chant at least sixteen rounds of beads daily without fail, and be happy in Krsna Consciousness life.

I am very happy to know that you are to be married with Sriman Nara Narayana and this is very nice. Both of you please accept my full blessings and sanction for your marriage. Work together for your mutual advancement in Krsna's service and be increasingly joyful in your Krsna Consciousness life. This is my desire.

Please take continued guidance from Bhagavan das and from your good husband and from other senior devotees and learn our philosophy very nicely.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
