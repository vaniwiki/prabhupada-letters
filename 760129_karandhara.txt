My dear Karandhara,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated January 21st, 1976.

The photos of my murti are very nice. The murti of the Spiritual Master should be treated as good as the Deity. __Saksad-dharitvena samasta-sastrair, uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih/kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya,__ The guru should be treated as good as God. This is stated in all the sastras. The difference is that God is master-God and guru is servant-God. So the installation ceremony for such a murti should be similar to that done for other Deities. All Temples can have this Deity if they like. But Temples which have only Panca-tattva painting worship should not be given this Deity.

You should make a murti of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati and then they may be worshiped together as is now being done in our Krishna Balarama Temple. They should be placed with Gaura Nitai---Guru Gauranga.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
