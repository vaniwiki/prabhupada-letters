My dear Mahamsa Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 7-5-75 and have noted the contents. Please find enclosed the copy of the draft agreement with my corrections made therein. The money you have requested can be paid, but unless there is a solid transference of the land over to ISKCON, then how can we invest any of our funds? It is not good business to invest money when it is not sure yet that the land will actually be transferred in the name of ISKCON. This must be considered very carefully before anything can be spent. Immediately send me one copy of the original trust document as drawn up by the settlor and I will examine it. After I have seen it, I will give my next instruction. Send reply to this letter along with copy of document to my Hawaii address: 51 Coelho Way, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
