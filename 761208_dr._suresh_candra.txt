Dear Dr. Suresh Candra,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your Bengali letter dated Nov. 26, 1976. I have noted the contents carefully.

It appears that you are an unmarried brahmacari. So, if you continue this status of life for the matter of executing devotional service, that will be a great advantage. Many great personalities remain brahmacari throughout their whole lives and get freedom from material bondage very easily. Of course marriage is not prohibited in devotional service, but if one can remain brahmacari, in unmarried life, it is a great facility.

I'm very much pleased for your proposal to devote your life for Krishna's service. You are a qualified man. Anyone can become a pure devotee by engaging himself in the business of glorifying the Supreme Lord (Sankirtana movement). So long we have got this material body the problems of birth, death, old age, and disease will continue. Therefore, to help the devotees when they're in bodily ailments is also a great great service. If you so desire you can join our Movement. We have got very good centers, especially in Mayapur, Bombay, Sri Vrindaban, Hyderabad, etc. If you decide to join, we can give you all facilities for rendering this service. At present I am staying at Hyderabad center and very soon I shall go to Bombay by the end of the month. Our Bombay address is as follows: Hare Krishna Land, Juhu Road, Juhu, Bombay 400 054. I shall be glad to hear from you. Thanking you once more for your offering service to Lord Krishna.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
