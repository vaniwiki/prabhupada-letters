Dear Mr. Fulton,

I thank you very much for your letter of the 31st March 1967 and I have noted the contents carefully. Mr. Alan Kallman of Pixi Records is my well wisher friend and it is very kind of him that he has desired to push my cause through your valuable endeavour.

I am returning herewith the Agreement duly signed by me along with some papers of my activities. Amongst the papers you will find one copy of literature of my Srimad-Bhagavatam and if you have no objection to mail such literatures then I can send you copies as many as you may desire. Any order received through you directly or indirectly will credit your account by the same commission namely 33-1/3%

Thanking you once more and awaiting your early reply. I am returning to New York on the 9th April 1967 by United Air Line.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

Enclosure: Signed Agreement & eight other papers.

This is to certify that His Holiness Tridandi-Swami Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaja is a bona fide initiated disciple of His Divine Grace Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Prabhupada, the Founder-Acarya of the Gaudiya Math Institutions and in November 1959 he took Sannyasam (renounced order of life) from His Holiness Tridandi Swami Bhakti Prajnan Kesava Maharaja, the Founder-President of the Gaudiya Vedanta Society. He is therefore an authorized Preacher and Teacher in the line of disciplic succession from Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who preached Krishna Consciousness all over India about 500 years ago and authorized His all disciplic successors to preach the Philosophy of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam in all towns and villages of the world. It is a great pleasure for all members of the Gaudiya Vaisnava Vedantists that Tridandi Swami Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaja is engaged in preaching the cult in the western world.

Swami B. V. Narayana
