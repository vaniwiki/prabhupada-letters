My dear Himavati,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your sending me the cap and dresses for Radha-Govinda, which are so nice and beautiful. When I put on the hat sent by you on my head, everyone says that it is brilliant, and because one has to dress according to the taste of friends this hat has become an important factor of my dressing. Thank you very much.

The present dress of the deity is a little shorter than usual. There is no need of sending any measurements, neither the present dresses are rejectable, but in the future you can make the dresses one-half inch longer than the present ones. The small dresses you sent will give an opportunity to look upon the Lotus Feet of the Lord and His Most Beautiful Consort, Srimati Radharani.

I know you are always eager to help me in all respects, and what can I do for you except pray to Krishna that you become more and more advanced in Krishna Consciousness along with your very, very good husband. Thanking you once more.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
