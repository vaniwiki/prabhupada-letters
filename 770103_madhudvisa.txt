My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings.

Srimati Govinda dasi is here and I have heard everything from her about yourself. Therefore, immediately after hearing from her I have sent you the following telegram: My dear son Madhudvisa please immediately come and live with me letter follows. So, when you come here we shall talk in detail and according to the conditions we shall arrange everything. There is no worry. I am still prepared to accept you as my original disciple and if there is anything wrong, I am prepared to try and correct it so that your life may not be spoiled. Please therefore come here immediately and live with me.

I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
