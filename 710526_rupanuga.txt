My Dear Rupanuga, 

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12th May, 1971 and have noted the contents carefully. This Krishna Consciousness Movement is sublime in the sense that if simply people see Krishna in every state of daily activities, they become perfect. As stated in Bhagavad-Gita, we can remember Krishna when drinking water, when seeing the sunshine and moonshine, when smelling a flower, when hearing the transcendental sound vibration, when chanting Vedic mantras, when seeing something beautiful or when seeing something wonderful done by a personality. Even in sex-life also we can appreciate Krishna, as He says that begetting children just in terms of principles of shastras, is Krishna. So in each and every state we can become Krishna Conscious and that is the success of life.

So far as sending $10,000. to Dia Nipon, I understood from Karandhar that he had $3,000. only at hand and has taken again from my book fund $5,000. and remitted to Dia Nipon. We must keep the distinction between BTG and book fund accounts. That is departmental. The loan of $20,000. was taken from the book fund and must be replaced departmentally. Please see to this. And they may or may not bill us, but you must be ready for payment for goods they supply. That will keep our credit nicely. Your debt is $70,000. That does not mean to increase it every month. Keep dealings very straightforward and it will help us.

Now press work must go on, so improve it. Chapter-wise Bhagawatam must become regularly published. On one side book distribution should go on and on the other side vigorous printing should go on. I have ordered from Dia Nipon $36,000. worth of KRSNA book paper backs and very soon we will get KRSNA book paperbacks, 50,000. So far as mail-order of paper backs, now you will have the chance. So far as raising the price of KRSNA book, Isopanisad, etc. you can do it or not if it is suitable. I have seen the brochure for Rathayatra, and it is very very nice.

Please offer my blessings to the others there. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
