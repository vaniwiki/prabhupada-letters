Vrindaban

Dear Gurudasa Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of January 28, and studied the contents.

Your suggestion that the devotees visiting Vrindaban engage in preaching and chanting and not in gossiping is very good. I have instructed that this be taken to the GBC and implanted. We have sacrificed our life for Krsna's service, where is there scope for sleeping and gossiping? You can see in my example, not a single moment is wasted. This idleness is the business of the karmis. They can be seen sitting in the park gossiping, "my son-in-law said this," "this man has cheated me." But it has no place in devotional service, so your suggestion is well made.

Your suggestion for groups teaching practical subjects like book distribution, deity worship, is also good. These things are wanted.

The installing of telex communications for our main temples is not required. Then they will gossip more through the telex.

So if you apply yourself in helping to prepare and implement these suggestions for the Vrindaban portion of our festival, that will be very good. Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
