Vrindaban

My dear Nitai das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 19, 1976 and I have noted the contents with care.

Continue with your program in the temple. It is a good program and it sounds that you are doing very nice! You may begin translations of Brhad-Bhagavatamrtam, and Laghu-Bhagavatamrtam as requested.

So you stick to Vrindaban some how or another. Use the security rooms below the Deities and look after it nicely and I will give you silver plates for the Deities on hearing from you assurance that they will be properly cared for. Previously I haven't introduced because of insecurity. Yes, be attached to the Deity and your life will be successful. One thing, how is the Deity collection box checked and accounted for?

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
