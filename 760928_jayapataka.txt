Mayapur

My dear Jayapataka,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 23rd inst. and have noted the contents. Regarding the Haridasapur land, first give the site plan and boundary statement and then we shall make plan with Saurabha. Yes, Gaura-Nitai Deities can be installed firstly as we generally do, also Lord Jagannatha and then Radha-Krishna, in three compartments. Formerly the construction was estimated at Rs. 50,000/-out of which Rs. 10,000/-is already with Prabhu Svarupa, Rs. 10,000/-we shall see for and Rs. 30,000/-shall be raised. If further investment is required that we shall see to it, but presently Rs. 50,000/-is maximum. Thakura Haridasa's murti can be installed.

Regarding our proposal for West Bengal: West Bengal people may come and join us without any distinction of caste and creed. The occupation will be according to one's capacity. They will be employed in cottage industry backed by spiritual advancement of life, to understand the mission of human life or relationship with God and act accordingly. The idea is that we are prepared to give all facility for maintenance of the body without sinful activities like illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Everyone should live peacefully in healthy condition of life with the purpose of advancing in spiritual consciousness. In this concept we can accept anyone from any part of the world, what to speak of West Bengal, and give them shelter, food, occupation and enlightenment. I had no contact with Chief Secretary.

Regarding handloom, can they not produce fine cloth? Fine cloth will be received in any part of the world. Regarding food distribution, they may come to take at our Temple. With travelling sankirtana we can distribute wherever we go, but not to the emergency spot, like that.

Who is managing Bengal Bhagavata Darsana? Raghunath Kundau (Radhe Syamasundara) has come here, and he is now first initiated. He can be used for this preaching work, he's willing. I understand the visitors in our Temple have increased on account of the propaganda. Have we increased distribution of Gitar Gan or not? Yes, whenever strong and probable false statements are made against ISKCON are made, we can take defamation case against them. I have given one statement in English,* Bengali and Hindi which I will send you, this may be published through the English and Bengali Press Trust of India (PTI). Sravanananda has a film on the last New York Rathayatra, so show this in every town, city, and village and present my statement in Bengali. Radhe Syamasundara is coming there to help, and I will send some newspaper clippings. Go on with our regular work and chanting. You can also show our book distribution figures from Sankirtana newsletters.

You are open to enquire anything from me. There must be my consultation in everything. Who is main acharya after departure of Tirtha Maharaja?

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
