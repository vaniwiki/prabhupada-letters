Srimati Indira Gandhi\\
Prime Minister of India

Your Excellency Srimati Indira\\
Gandhi Devi:

I thank you very much for kindly allowing an interview to my disciples Sriman Gurudasa Adhikari accompanied by his wife also, Srimati Yamuna devi. Perhaps your Excellency is aware of our Krsna consciousness movement all over the world. We are not only preaching the cult by chanting and dancing, but also by presenting in the English language the books of the __bhakti__ cult, especially Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam all over the world.

You will be pleased to know that our books are being well received in all parts of the world, and recently we have information from London that in two months time we have sold 30,000 copies of the Bhagavad-gita As It Is.

I am sending herewith one copy of my book Bhagavad-gita As It Is as my humble presentation. I hope at your convenient leisure time, you can have a glance over this book, at least the preliminary statement in the Foreword, Introduction, and Preface, which will convince you of the importance of the book.

We think that Bhagavad-gita As It Is without a wrong interpretation can solve all the problems of human society, namely social, political, religious, economic, philosophical, cultural, or from any angle of vision, because it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is above all deficiency, namely mistake, illusion, cheating, and the imperfection of the senses.

So we in our humble way are trying to spread this cult of Bhagavad-gita all over the world, and my American and European disciples, two samples of them are meeting with you, are helping me in this connection. After all, Bhagavad-gita is the sublime __cultural__ knowledge, and of course religion is included there, but it is not fanaticism or sentimental religion. It is based on pure science, philosophy, and logic.

I wish that our Indian government will be proud to take up this cultural movement very seriously, so that the whole world will be benefited, and India will be glorified. I hope Krsna will give you the proper sense to understand my humble presentation, and it will be a great pleasure to know you have relished this Bhagavad-gita As It Is without any unauthorized commentation.

Thanking you once more for giving us the opportunity to see you in this connection.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
