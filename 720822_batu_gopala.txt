My dear Batu Gopala,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated August 18, 1972 and I have noted the contents. So far the fire yajna is concerned, you can wait until Janmastami celebrations in New Vrindaban, and they can take part in that yajna. I am very much pleased to hear how nicely you are presenting Krishna consciousness through your radio program, and I think if you just carry on as you are it will be very successful.

By remaining steady in your chanting, always completing at least 16 rounds on your beads, and studying our books carefully, along with chanting of the Sanskrit mantras in Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita, automatically you will become freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and gravity and steadiness will come. You can use your lust for the service of Krishna, and then you will be transcendentally situated.

You get the seed of devotion, and the Hare Krishna mantra through the mercy of the spiritual master and Krishna. Similarly, upon your surrender, the spiritual master and Krishna take responsibility for your sins. So if you commit sin again, the spiritual master becomes responsible for your sinful reaction. Therefore, it is the disciple's duty not to commit sin again. Not only Gayatri mantra, but all mantras cleanse one from sinful reactions, but we should not chant these mantras and then commit sin again.

Upon your recommendation, I will be very glad to accept Sriman Paul Zarouny as my duly initiated disciple. He can take part along with the others at New Vrindaban. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
