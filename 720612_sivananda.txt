====== Letter to: Sivananda ======

My dear Sivananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter dated 1st June, 1972, and upon your recommendation I am glad to accept Peter Brinkmann as my duly initiated disciple. His letter follows. Yes, I shall be glad to meet with you in London during Rathayatra in a few weeks, and at that time I shall be very glad to give you the Sannyas order of life, so you may prepare for that.

Meanwhile, Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
