My dear Svarupa Damodara das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter with contents dated May 15, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care.

The idea of lecture seminars is very good. This is required. It is a very nice idea.

Concerning your immigration application, that is o.k. that you may not be able to leave Atlanta for some time, do not worry. They require some bank balance. Whatever bank balance they require, we shall supply. The health examination is there. You are employed by ISKCON, a registered association in the U.S.A.

Concerning the emblem for the Bhaktivedanta Institute, the words "Athāto brahma jijñāsā" is alright, however instead of inside the emblem, you can put athato on top (in Devanagari) and brahma jijnasa on the bottom (in Devanagari). That will be nice. Enclosed you will find your copy with the ideas written on the appropriate place.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
