Calcutta

My dear Acyutananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21 January, 1970, and it is very encouraging that you have very good ambition for developing our Mayapur center. Your present program that you are constantly engaged in Kirtana at about 40 places, that is very very good appointments. Our first and foremost business is to preach and by Krishna's Grace you have taken this task very seriously. It will have good effects, so continue this program.

So far the Calcutta land is concerned, your ambition to have a place like Mullicks Thakurabati, the pilgrimage of my childhood, is also my ambition. When I think of Radha-Krishna, I think of first the Radha-Govinda Vigraha of Mullicks Thakurabati because from my very childhood I am devoted to the same Deity; but at the same time it is not an easy task to have such a big plot of land in Calcutta city at the present moment. Under the circumstances, if the small plot of land which is being offered can be had without any condition, then you can accept it. But if they make a condition that the land is offered for Deity worship, I do not think it will be feasible for you at the present moment because you are alone.

For proper Deity worship at least two men will be required for full time engagement. So I do not know how to solve this problem because you are alone. At the present moment you are living in the Temple of Madhava Maharaja and preaching outside, so you have no inconvenience. But if you are engaged in Deity worship alone, I do not know how you will preach; and if you want men, what is your suggestion for getting such men? We can accept the small plot of land for future development only, but if they make this condition that we will have to immediately take up the work as well as the Deity worship, I do not think it will be practical.

Regarding the Mayapur land: Paramahamsa Maharaja has written that the side land, about five bighas, is available at the rate of Rs. 600 per bigha. So we do not mind to take each side lands if they are available at that rate, but one thing we must be assured that there is no inundation.

So whatever you do, you consult with Paramahamsa Maharaja and request him to stay in Bengal until the land is purchased. You alone cannot manage things. When the land is purchased, send me a layout and I shall give you the plan for construction. I shall expect a report in your next letter.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
