My dear Jayasacinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Nov. 30, 1976 accompanied by your translation of Srila Bhaktivinode's songs. Thank you very much. You have done nicely.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
