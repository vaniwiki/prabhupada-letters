Dear Jayapataka Maharaja:

Please accept my blessings. When I was there last there was one boy who was for making dolls. I want to know how the samples are coming out, if they are nice. Can he teach our students how to do this art? If so, our men can go there and learn, or should he be sent here to USA? Please write to me in this regard at L.A.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
