Dear Sir, 

I beg to inform you that on 13/4/75 there was an advertisement in the Ananda Bazar Patrika on behalf of West Bengal Housing Board that you are receiving application for apartments in Barahanagar Apartment Housing Estate. In this connection, I wish to take one apartment of 780 square feet consisting of one sitting room, two bedrooms, one reading room, two bathrooms, dining place and corridor. Kindly let me know what is the price and how you are receiving money for this purpose. The reply for this letter may be sent to Sri Brindavan Candra De, c/o Vrinda Book Co., 30/1B, College Row, Calcutta-700009, West Bengal, India.

Thanking you.

Yours faithfully,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
