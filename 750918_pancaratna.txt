====== Letter to: Pancaratna ======

Brooklyn

My dear Pancaratna das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated July 17, 1975. This proposal of yours is out of the question and it shall not be done. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
