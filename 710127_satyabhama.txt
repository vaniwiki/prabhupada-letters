My dear Satyabhama Devi Dasi,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to your fine Vaisnava son Premananda. I am in due receipt of your very kind letter dated 28th December.

Yes, you may write some of the stories in simplified version for the children. That is very nice. The story of characters cannot be changed or anything made up, but simply the language may be changed. Also it is good to note that you are writing these children's books to comply with the academic standards of the public schools. In this way you should seriously work to compile these books along with the help of Krishna Bhamini. Then they can be printed by our press and dispatched to N.Y. centers as well as all our other centers. Krishna Consciousness is for everyone and so we can present your books to the public also in that light. You can send me copies of some of the stories you have written in which there are "personified animals" and I will tell you if they are all right. So go on compiling these books. Do it nicely and Krishna will bless you.

Thanking you once more for your kind letter. Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
