My dear Revatinandana,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 29-5-73, and accompanying essay, and have noted the contents carefully.

Yes, your article is very nice. It is very important that we now expose the nonsense theories of these rascal scientists who assert that life comes from matter. They say that life comes from some chemicals, but they cannot say wherefrom these chemicals have come. Actually, if we examine carefully, chemicals are coming from life, not life from chemicals. Just like the lemon tree. It is producing so many lemons. In each lemon there is so much citric acid. So, due to the presence of life, so many chemicals are being produced. Also, I have experienced, that one of my toenails has come off due to infection, but now my body is replacing that nail with another one of the exact size and shape as the one I have lost. If I have got such a potency to create, then what to speak of the Supreme Living Being lord Sri Krsna. If the sub-living entities can produce so much chemicals then what to speak of the Supreme living entity. This is called inconceivable potency. The living being has got an inconceivable potency to create. I do not know how my nail is coming. And the Supreme Living Entity or God, has got unlimited potency to create. I do not think that any reasonable intelligent man or scientist can deny. __Aham sarvasya prabhavo,__ I am the source of everything, [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]].

Regarding my coming to London for Rathayatra on July 8th, if my health is by that time permitting, then I surely will come there to London.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
