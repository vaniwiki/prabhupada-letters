My dear Krsnakanti,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your informative letter dated November 15th, 1970, and noted the contents. I know you are a very qualified and sincere devotee and now Krsna is offering you a nice opportunity to perform responsible devotional service as the president of our Seattle Temple.

I am happy to hear that your campus engagements are very well received especially on the Catholic campus. That is a good sign that the students are still intelligent to find what is the best information about God and how to approach him. It is unfortunate that they are without proper guidance, but that is the condition of all persons in the world without exception. Krsna Consciousness is

I hope you are trying to place our books in the libraries and school/colleges. The program is everywhere very successful, so you please do this very thoroughly in your area and it will be a great service.

Please offer my blessings to all the Prabhus and your good wife. Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
