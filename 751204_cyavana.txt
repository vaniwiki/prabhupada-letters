My dear Cyavana Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 17, 1975. I have noted the contents carefully. The program you have suggested can be discussed at the Mayapur GBC meeting. At Mayapur each year a program is chalked out for the entire year, and that is to be executed till the GBC meets again.

I hope this letter finds you well.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
