====== Letter to: Hayagriva ======

My dear Hayagriva,

Please accept my blessings. You have nicely done %%____%% Lord Caitanya Drama 1st Act. It is nicely done literature but when playing you will have to make it cut short otherwise it will take too long a time. I have given it over to Rayarama for reading.

Rayarama has arranged for a press. We can now work our own press. So Back To Godhead and our books now can be printed in this press by our own men. I think you should now come back and see the printing work done nicely. You will hear more from Rayarama.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
