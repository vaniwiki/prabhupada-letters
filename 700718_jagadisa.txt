My dear Jagadisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge your letter dated 8th July, 1970, in which you have recommended the initiation of Srimati Stephanie O'Henly. I have received her letter and beads also and I have initiated her duly. I have returned the beads in another packet and her initiated name is Srilekhadevi Dasi. I beg to thank you also for the check for $50 donation to my book fund. Thank you very much.

Regarding your request for Gayatri mantra to be given to Dharmaraj, since both you and Rupanuga recommend him for second initiation it is alright. I am sending you therefore one copy of Gayatri mantra on a small tape along with specific directions for performing the ceremony. Also enclosed you will find one sacred thread duly sanctified by me and it is for Dharmaraj. The sacred thread will be given by you at the end of the fire sacrifice as it is given in the instructions. Please return this tape directly to me as soon as the initiation is done.

I learn that you have got now fifteen members at your center and this is very encouraging news for me. Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls there.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Instead of returning the taped mantra directly to me, send it on to Bhagavan das as soon as the ceremony for Sriman Dharmaraj is performed. I have advised Bhagavan das of this, so please do it as soon as possible.\\
