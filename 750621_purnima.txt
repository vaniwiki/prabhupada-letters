My dear Purnima das:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 19, 1975, and I thank you very much for it. I am glad that you are very serious about Krishna consciousness even at such a young age. This is the instruction of Prahlada Maharaja who was a young boy like yourself. He said that now is the time to become Krishna conscious no matter what is one's age. We may die at any moment. There is no guarantee. So you please stick to this line you have taken and chant Hare Krishna every day without fail. You will be very happy, and I shall pray to Krishna for your advancement.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
