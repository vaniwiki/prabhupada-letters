My dear Akshayananda,

Please accept my blessings.

Enclosed please find a clipping from the Times of India regarding our New York High Court victory. Please mount this article nicely and display it at the entrance of our Temple. The gentlemen who visit our Temple should not take our movement lightly as some sentiment, and when reading this article they will understand the significance of our movement.

Hoping this finds you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
