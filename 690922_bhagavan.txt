My dear Bhagavan das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you very much for your letter dated September 15th, 1969, and I am encouraged to learn how your temple is progressing nicely. You write to say that already two new boys, Frank and Ed, have joined our Krishna Consciousness Movement, and that is very good news. Please take very nice care of them and help them to understand our principles as far as possible. Actually, in every town and city there are many, many devotees of Krishna; now it is our business to go around the world wherever people are congregating and pick up these sincere souls. The world is suffering for want of this knowledge of Krishna Consciousness, and we experience practically that many people will take to this spiritual line simply if we make this information available to them. So continue to develop your Sankirtana Party activities, and if you are given permission to accept donations, that will increase the strength of your activities there. You may consult with Tamala Krishna in Los Angeles for advice as to how to approach the authorities for obtaining such permission. That 50 people are coming to your Love Feasts and 15-20 people are coming to the kirtanas in the temple is good news also. As you are a sincere servant of Krishna, Krishna is recognizing your efforts to serve Him nicely and thus He is crowning your labors for Him with success. As more and more you increase in sincerity, similarly Krishna will more and more reciprocate by giving you the intelligence to serve Him nicely.

Regarding your question, we must utilize our intelligence fully for serving Krishna. Serving Krishna does not mean that we sit idly and say that Krishna will take care of all our business. That is not depending on the Lord; rather it is laziness. Depending on Krishna means to act always in Krishna Consciousness, realizing that Krishna is the Ultimate Controller of all results. I hope you understand this properly.

Please offer my blessings to the others. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
