====== Letter to: B. K. Nehru ======

Dear Shri Nehru:

Please accept my greetings. After my arrival in India I advised my disciple Sriman Brahmananda Brahmachary (Mr. Bruce Scharf) to present my books to you personally. I hope by this time you have received my edition of Srimad Bhagwatam and hope that you will enjoy them.

It is understood also that you are coming back to India very soon as Governor of Assam. As I told you on the plane, there was pending a bill in the Congress of the

U.S. for my permanent visa, but since I have come back to India on account of my indifferent health, the pending bill is now automatically cancelled.

Now I wish to return to the States by the end of October, 1967, and you told me that you could help me in getting a permanent visa; you also asked me to see you when I return. But if in the meantime you come back to India, then I would request you to leave a note to your successor about this, or better yet, obtain the visa now. Because I have already opened six branches (New York, San Francisco, Montreal, Boston, Sante Fe, and Los Angeles), I require to travel in so many places. As you have seen personally, my spiritual activities are genuine, and are beneficial for all the people of the world. I hope you will help me in having a permanent visa, and oblige. Hope you are well, and thanking you in anticipation.

Very sincerely yours,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
