My dear Visakha devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated August 3, 1974. The advertisement proposals for BTG are approved by me. Yes, you use your American ingenuity in this way to spread Krsna Consciousness. I also thank you very much for the photograph of the sannyasis taken in Mayapur. I have had it framed and it is hanging here in my room in Vrindaban, amongst the large paintings of the Disciplic succession. It is by their kindness, of the previous acaryas that they let us sit between them just like a father calls for a child to sit down next to him. Actually we are unqualified but by their kindness they let us sit next to them.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
