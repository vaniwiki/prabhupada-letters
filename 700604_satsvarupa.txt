My dear Satsvarupa,

Please accept my blessings. The tape recorder which you have taken for Dinesh---whether he has taken delivery? He wanted it very urgently, so if he has not taken it yet, you can inform him by telephone.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. With further reference to question five, in both the Bible and the Koran it is always recommended to be engaged always in __kirtana__ or glorifying the Supreme Lord. __Kirtana__ means to glorify the Lord by your vibration. In the churches there is always singing of praise and glories of the Lord and there is preaching naturally also. Mohammedans actually have singing kirtana publicly. This I have seen in India that they were holding kirtana with drum accompaniment.\\
