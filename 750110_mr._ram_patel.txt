My dear Mr. Patel

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter concerning your son Durgesh. I am very sorry for any inconvenience that has come upon you due to this misunderstanding. I did not receive any letter from you until now about the situation so I was not aware fully of the circumstances as you have given them. Your son should stay with you and abide by your instructions. I will be coming there in April and will be more than glad to meet with you and your son at that time if you so wish. Again, I am sorry for any misunderstanding that may have occurred.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
