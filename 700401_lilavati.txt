My dear Lilavati,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 23rd March, 1970. So I am glad to learn that your daughter and Syamasundara's daughter are learning Krsna Consciousness very nicely. The program was that you would go to New Vrindaban for training children---never mind, you can do it there also.

So far George's house is concerned, it was formerly learned through Syamasundara that he also wants to have a Krsna Consciousness center there. If he gives us a place there, just like Lennon gave a place in his garden, then you can start a similar temple there under your supervision. But unless there is some tangible program there, I think you should not divert attention in starting a new center there.

We have to organize this London center very solidly, so at least on Sundays all of you should come there and manage things. Anyway, conjointly you shall manage the London center and Sankirtana---that should not be neglected.

Regarding George's center, if he opens it very nicely according to his position, then on hearing from Syamasundara. I shall give direction how to do it. I have already written Syamasundara about this, and I am awaiting his reply. The conclusion is that you are so many advanced disciples now in Europe, including Hamburg, London and Paris. Now you should organize the Sankirtana Movement in Europe by opening as many centers as possible from town to town at least. So do it conjointly and that will give me very much satisfaction.

Hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
