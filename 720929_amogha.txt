My dear Amogha,

Please accept my blessings. Thank you very much for your letter dated Sept. 21, 1972, and I have noted the contents with great encouragement. I am especially happy to hear that you have got one Chinese boy there who is doing some translating work. Yes, the Chinese-speaking portion of the world is very huge and it requires to infiltrate gradually, especially by distributing our literatures widely in Chinese language. So his service is the greatest to Krsna. Try to recruit any such local men there for helping you spread this movement in Indonesia and other places nearby, because it will not be possible to always import our men. Better is that you convert the local people and train them nicely in our philosophy and send them off for preaching party.

Now I am going to India very soon from Los Angeles and I shall be stopping for three days in Philippines, Manila* before going on to Delhi. I don't know if it is possible, but if you like you can come there to meet me. Otherwise, I shall be happy to visit you in Djakarta on my return from India next year.

Hoping this meets you all in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
