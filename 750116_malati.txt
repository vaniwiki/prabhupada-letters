My dear Malati devi dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 12-1-75 and have noted the contents. Thank you very much for the honeycomb and the camphor that you sent. Always fix yourself in Krishna's service and you will be far away from Maya's touch.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
