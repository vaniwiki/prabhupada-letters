Dear Prapujaka dasa and Avinasa Candra dasa,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your report dated Dec. 28th. Yes go on with your preaching work, Krsna will bless you. A little attempt is required, then all other things will come from Krsna. This is my practical experience I made a little attempt and Krsna has sent so many representatives like you to help me. Regarding that Sanskrit student who bought six books, yes, our word meanings will induce any Sanskrit scholar to purchase.

Hoping this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
