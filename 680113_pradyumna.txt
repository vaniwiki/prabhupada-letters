My dear Pradyumna,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you for your nice letter of Jan. 13, 1968. Your eagerness to render service to the Lord is very much appreciated by me. Please get the copy of Sri Sri Brahma Samhita, and begin the transliteration. I think you know the diacritical marks for transliteration; please use them. Please send me full photostat copy of the original Brahma Samhita. I shall begin writing my own commentation after my Guru Maharaja. Gaurasundara will be helping me prepare this Brahma Samhita. After you finish transliteration of Brahma Samhita then we shall see for Srimad-Bhagavatam. Hope you are well.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
