My dear Jayatirtha,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated December 24th, 1975.

The $1900 payment should be used half for Gurukula and half for the Temple.

Regarding Yamuna and Dinatarine, they want to live independently, that is the defect. A woman cannot live independent. According the the Vedic culture a woman is always to be protected by a man. Why they should purchase a house? We already have Los Angeles. If they want they can have a separate asrama supported independently of ISKCON. Every woman in America has money, so why do they want support? No, the BBT cannot give them loan. You may check that they are chanting and following the rules but do not get involved with their management. So far your suggestion that they sew clothes for the sannyasis Deities it is not possible. Sannyasis may have no connection with women.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
