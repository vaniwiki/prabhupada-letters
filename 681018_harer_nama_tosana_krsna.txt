My dear Harer Nama and Tosana Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Oct. 12, 1968, and I thank you very much for your invitation. Please offer my blessings to other members of the temple who are residing there. And I have decided to go to your temple by the 26th October. On the 23rd of October, 1968, I am going to Montreal to keep one appointment with the Consulate General of United States, and then by the 26th instant I wish to go to Santa Fe directly. I hope you have already talked with Jayananda in this connection. And now you can arrange for that.

I thank you once more for your assurance of service to Krishna and it is very enlightening for me that we have got so many nice souls to serve the cause of Krishna, and in the matter of pushing Krishna consciousness in this country and all over the world. I beg to remain,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
