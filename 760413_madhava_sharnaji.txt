My dear Madhava Sharnaji,

Please accept my greetings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated 6 April, 1976, and I have noted the contents with care. I am going to Australia shortly, and thereafter to New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, etc. It will take about 4 months to come back. There will be another temple opening ceremony in Hyderabad by August, 1976, and probably I shall return by that time. Kindly try to meet me when I return and we shall talk more when we meet.

I hope that this meets you in good health.

Yours sincerely,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
