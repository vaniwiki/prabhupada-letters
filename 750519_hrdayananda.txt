My dear Hrdayananda Goswami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your report dated April 30, 1975 and have noted the contents. When our Mexico City branch is open, how can we close it? That building there is very nice and we have been there for five years now. I am not at all in favor of closing such a temple. Stay there in that building somehow or other, and if you like, you may also open a center in Guadalajara. We can keep men in Mexico City who are approved by the government, why should we close it? Jagadisa prabhu is there, so, work together with consultation so that we may remain in that building. Jagadisa has met one good lawyer and he is helping us. It looks favorable for us. You and Jagadisa please arrange it so that we may not have to leave Mexico City. That is my desire.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. Thank you for distributing so many books and please continue to print more books with added enthusiasm.\\
