My dear Rajiblocan das,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 20, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. As you are temple president, that is a great responsibility. So you must try to execute it with great care. The main thing is that you must set nice example for the others by following very rigidly the regulative principles, such as chanting 16 rounds on the beads, reading the books, getting up to attend mangala aratrika, etc. In this way everyone shall be encouraged. We must be so careful to train the devotees nicely. Now they have come from the realm of maya to Krsna's place, so it is our duty to keep them there, not that they shall again fall victim of maya.

Regarding the question of your wife's initiation, that is certainly approved by me. You may arrange with Kirtanananda Maharaja for receiving beads duly chanted upon by him. Now both of you cooperate for pushing on this Krsna Consciousness movement as this is our only business in this human form of life.

I hope this finds you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
