My dear Govinda Dasi:

Please accept my blessings. In the past you were sending me the dried banana, so you please resume sending me. The day after tomorrow I am starting for Los Angeles, so I would like to receive some of that dried banana from you.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
