My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of Feb. 22, 1968 with enclosures. I am writing letter to Sri Hrsikesa Brahmacari giving him instructions. You also write them to work for the Society in cooperation with Acyutananda without wasting time in sight seeing.

Regarding Dictaphone, Aniruddha is doing something.

I am now scheduled to go to S.F. by the 10th March 1968. Why not come here a few days earlier try to see some millionaires in connection with our Society's cause.

How Janaki is doing. My blessings for her.

Your ever well wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
