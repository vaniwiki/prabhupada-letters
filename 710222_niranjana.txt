My dear Niranjana,

Please accept my blessings. I am glad to receive your letter dated 15th Feb. 71. I am so glad that you are performing devotional service seriously by chanting 16 rounds daily. Do not be agitated with the criticism of your friends because Caitanya Mahaprabhu said that one should be humbler that a blade of grass and should be more tolerant than a tree for chanting Hare Krishna Mantra. So stick to the principle of chanting 16 rounds daily and reading our books regularly, and one day you will be a great preacher of this cult.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. By 10th of March I will be visiting Sri Mayapur dham. The birth site of Lord Caitanya in Navadvipa. If possible join us.

We are getting a piece of land in Gorakhpur\\
