My dear Madhudvisa,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18th March, 1970. I have already chanted the beads of Srimati Maithili Dasi, and I hope you have received them back.

I was very busy since a few days on account of purchasing the new church, and other documentary activities. This morning we have paid $50,000 down payment. Gargamuni was to take from me, from my book fund, $20,000. So the boys here have taken a great risk by purchasing this church property. When Krsna has given us this chance, I hope He will give us chance also to liquidate the balance amount as soon as possible.

You are trying for the new Temple, but our main business is Sankirtana and distribution of literature. If Krsna gives us a better place, that is all-right. Otherwise, we can remain at any place never mind hell or heaven; but we shall be only very cautious about propagating our Sankirtana movement.

I am very glad to learn that you have already been promised for $15,000, and I think these are indication of your getting a nice house very soon. Ratha Yatra Festival is your most important function of the year. I introduced this Ratha Yatra in San Francisco, accepting the place as New Jagannatha Puri. So this festival must be observed very gorgeously every year. Similarly, if two other processions like on the Birthday of Lord Caitanya as well as on the Birthday of Lord Krsna, are observed, it will be still nicer.

Last time when you came here, I was very much encouraged to see you. Similarly whenever you find some time, if you come for a day or two, you will be able to suggest improvement here as well as you will take improvements from here and introduce them in your Temple and others.

It will be very pleasing to learn that in the morning you are now studying from one and one half to two hours and in the evening you have class from forty five minutes to an hour, and you are stressing the importance of lecturing and preaching with authoritative and substantial arguments.

Please offer my blessings to all the boys and girls in San Francisco Temple.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
