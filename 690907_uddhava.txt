My dear Uddhava,

Please accept my blessings. I thank you very much for your letter dated September 2nd, 1969 along with your check for 50 dollars and the velvet covering for my __Bhagavad-gita As It Is,__ so nicely made. Now you are happy with your wife, Lilasukha, and that is also very pleasing to me. Most of my disciples who are preaching are married couples. As such, I hope both you and your wife will continue to help me substantially in the Krishna Consciousness Movement, and Krishna will bless you more and more.

Thanking you once more for your letter. I hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
