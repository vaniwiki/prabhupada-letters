My dear Brahmananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated February 9, and February 10, 1969, as well as today I have received the article which was written by Howard Smith. Regarding the books, __True Conception of Religion__ and __Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu,__ for __True Conception__ you may send 40 cents per copy to S. Brahmacari, and you may send $2.55 per copy to Swami Bon. As we are printing __Nectar of Devotion,__ this is the summary study of __Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu,__ there is no need of further ordering this book from India.

Regarding __Back To Godhead,__ if Dai Nippon will come down to $1,500 for 20,000 copies, or even if they charge a little more, we should immediately accept, setting the magazine at first at 32 pages, one only color cover picture as in issue number 22, and three black and white pictures within, and no advertisements. It should all be reading matter of Krishna Consciousness articles. I am negotiating with the principle centers for consuming 5,000 copies at least and paying $750 contribution no matter if the copies are sold or not. The price should be 50 cents, and the paper's quality may be as it is now. In that way set up negotiations so that from number 25, we may be able to print from Dai Nippon, and they have to deliver 10,000 copies to Los Angeles or San Francisco, 5,000 to New York and 5,000 to London. These four centers may distribute the issues to the smaller centers as they are able.

I have seen the article in the Village Voice, and it is nice. If you are expecting good rush in New Vrindaban, then arrange for proper development of it. But pending all development there, we must get our books and magazines printed from Dai Nippon. Have you negotiated with Dai Nippon about further books? If they agree, we can immediately arrange to print 2 or 3 books by some arrangement. Please immediately send me dried mango. It is my daily food, and it keeps me fit. So you should regularly send the same quantity every month as you sent last time. That is your personal contribution to me.

So you and Gargamuni take charge of distributing the books, and you study other methods of how to do this. If distribution of my books is fixed up then my life is fixed up in your country for the remaining days of my present body. Please therefore do it seriously. I am pleased that you are willing to take charge of the printing of my books. Krishna has desired like that, so you try to execute this implicit order of Krishna. Actually, by your grace, these two publications are already in the light, so your service in this connection is approved by Krishna and naturally by me also. So you try in this line. I am sure you will be successful, assisted by your good brother, Gargamuni. It is good that you are contacting distributers. You should offer them the best terms.

Please send to me the address of Satyavrata (Stanley Moskowitz). I would like to send to him one copy of __Bhagavad-gita As It Is.__ Regarding your need for a typist. Try to find out somebody to help you for now. If need be, when I go to New York in April I shall arrange for someone to type for you. Regarding the departments not contributing to the temple, this is not very satisfactory situation. The method of contributing should be those who are not married should contribute all their income to the temple. Those who are married should contribute 50%. That should be the principle of contribution of the members and followers of the Krishna Consciousness movement. So if there are problems in this matter, discuss it in the board meetings. If such things are not settled there, then what is the meaning of this board of trustees? The local management of affairs must be decided by the board, and that decision should be final.

Regarding MacMillan's bill, whatever you have collected immediately send to them. For the bill which I have, I will send it sometimes this week. I have received checks from Boston for $25 and from Buffalo for $69. So I will send these too, but why are the centers sending this money to me? Please advise them all to send them directly to you so there needn't be this botheration from this end.

Please convey my blessings to the other devotees at the New York temple. I hope this will meet you in good health and cheerful mood.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
