My dear Jagadananda,

Please accept my blessings and offer the same to all of your family members. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1st May, 1977.

Regarding your daughter's illness, all of the family members should sit down together and hold Hare Krsna kirtan. Let your daughter hear and she will be alright.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
