====== Letter to: Ramesvara ======

Los Angeles

My dear Ramesvara Maharaja,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated September 9, 1976 and have noted the contents with care. I am very pleased with your report and your contact with this author and producer. Now you may take it as my direct order that you __must__ finish the Theistic Exhibit __before__ the Mayapur festival, otherwise what is the use of all this endeavor?

Yadubara should be encouraged as he has given good service. Both his wife and himself are both serving nicely. I approve their work and they should be encouraged in all respects. In future we shall get more and more valuable services from them.

These management affairs sometimes disturb me. Kindly manage nicely. I want that the properties should not be jeopardized. So the idea of the declarations from the presidents is absolutely required. Nobody can do anything without my signature; that should be enforced.

In general, if any translator of my books requires the original manuscripts for his work, he should be supplied them by you. If you can succeed in spreading this movement to every town and village throughout the world that will be your great credit. Kindly do this and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu will be pleased and my Guru Maharaja will be pleased and I, as their humble servant, will also be pleased. That is our main goal in life, our __svartha gatim.__

Enclosed please find one check for $1,000.00 from ISKCON BBT Library and College Sales Dept. Kindly deposit this in the ISKCON Mayapur-Vrndavana Trust Fund in Bank of America, LA, and advise me. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
