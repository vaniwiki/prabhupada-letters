Dear Riktananda,

Please accept my blessings. I have received your letter of April 15, 1974 and noted the contents.

Your proposal to come to Vrindaban and serve the deities in our new Krsna Balarama temple is approved by me. We require many first class devotees to make the temple alive with transcendental bliss, so as your departure is also sanctioned by Jayatirtha, you make your plans and come to Vrindaban at your convenience.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
