My dear Madhudvisa Swami;

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your telegram regarding the baby boy born to Ram Prasad. So far the name is concerned you can call him Bhaktivardhana das. All my blessings are there for the child so that he may become a pure Vaisnava. I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
