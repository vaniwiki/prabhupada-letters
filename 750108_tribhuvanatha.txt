My dear Tribhuvanatha das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Jan. 5th, 1975 and have noted the contents. Regarding your coming to India, I was told by Bhagavan das that you wanted to leave England and that it would be good for you to come to India, so I said that I had no objection of your coming to India. But if you can stay there in England and continue your festival program, that will be best. It is a very nice program. You should increase it as much as possible.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
