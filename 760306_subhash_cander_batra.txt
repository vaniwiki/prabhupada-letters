My dear Mr. Batra,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter with enclosed check and I thank you very much. I am very happy to learn that the new Toronto centre has been acquired and I thank you for assisting our mission in this way. It is also very nice that the building is now transferred into the name of our ISKCON. All over the world we are acquiring so many nice centres and this is Krishna's mercy simply to help us push on our preaching work. Thank you very much.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
