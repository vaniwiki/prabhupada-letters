My dear Visalaini devi,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Dec. 12, 1974 and have noted the contents. You can work on the hair sets while the Deities are taking rest. Regarding your other questions, they can be answered by your temple president or GBC man.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
