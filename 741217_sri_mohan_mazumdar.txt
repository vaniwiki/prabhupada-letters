Dear Sri Mohan Mazumdar,

Please accept my greetings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter in Bengali dated 10.12.74 and have noted the contents with care. Regarding your proposal for preparing a film on the life and precepts of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, I am ready to help with my men but it is not possible for me to make the financial help. If you can arrange with some film studio men for direction and photographic handling etc., my men are ready to help you in this connection, at any time. Also I shall be glad to give direction. This is all possible in Los Angeles but you have to arrange all these things. I have previously instructed you to contact some film producer company in Los Angeles, but I do not know if you have done so. So I still stick to my word as I earlier said to you. You can arrange but I think it will cost huge amounts of financial assistance, of course our service is free, but for other things you have to arrange for financial balance. Anyway I am always ready to help in the above mentioned ways. But one thing I shall advise you, if there is a difficulty for financial arrangement you can drop the idea. Now you are old, 60 years old, better retire from all enterprising activities and devote yourself fully for developing Krishna Consciousness. That will not cost you any financial assistance at all. You can live with us anywhere in the world and along with our devotees gradually you will learn all devotion activities. And if you desire you can translate our English books into Bengali language. You are already reading our __Nectar of Devotion__ and if you like this idea you can translate this __Nectar of Devotion__ immediately into Bengali and send me some copies of the translation so I can see how you have done.

For the time being I have postponed my journey to Honolulu. Maybe I will be going to Australia by mid-January 1975.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
