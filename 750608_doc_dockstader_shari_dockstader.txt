My dear Doc and Shari,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 29th, 1975 and have noted the contents. I am very pleased to know that you have accepted the Krishna Consciousness way of life. Please continue with determination to keep chanting 16 rounds daily and follow all of the regulative principles very strictly. Upon the recommendation of Revatinandana Swami, I have accepted you both as my initiated disciples and I have sent your names to Revatinandana Swami who can give them to you at the proper time at the initiation ceremony. Please continue your Krishna Conscious program with great faith and steadiness.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
