West Berlin

My dear Sivananda,

Please accepting my blessings and those of Lord Krishna. I am sure Krishna is protecting you and your sincerity of service will bring Krishna and more and more near to you. So have faith in Him and surely you will be successful in opening branch in W. Berlin. Indications of Krishna's help are very much hopeful.

I am going today to New York and after one week I shall start for San Francisco. Some San Francisco boys who know German language are eager to help you and join you with Mrdanga etc. Please let me know your opinion on this matter. They can start immediately and they have little money also. I have given him the address and most probably he will write you. His name is Krsna dasa Brahmacari c/o San Francisco Temple 518 Frederick St. San Francisco, Cal 90117.

I see in your letter every thing very favorable and it seems that I will have to go first in Berlin then in London. Anyway just depend on Krishna and he will do everything in order. Hope this will find you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Other devotees from San Francisco have already started for London. Mukunda's address as follows\\
Michael Grant\\
c/o American Express Co.\\
Haymarket St.\\
London. U.K.

I hope you have also received my former letter addressed to you c/o American Express Berlin.
