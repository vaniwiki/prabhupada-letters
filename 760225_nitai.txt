My dear Nitai,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17 February, 1976.

We will wait for the letter from Giridhari Lal.

As for the college, anyway take some affiliation, that will help students to come here on student visa.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
