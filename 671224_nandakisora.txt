My dear Nandakisora,

Please accept my blessings. I am very glad to accept you. I am in due receipt of your letter of Dec. 24, and I am very glad to accept you as one of the servitors of Krishna. You are right when you say our past life is a dream only. Just like at night we see so many dreams and in daytime we forget everything. Similarly we forget everything of our past life and as such so long we do not be reposed to our spiritual factual life, all these changes of lives one after another are considered to be dreams. Less intelligent persons are very much interested in dreaming life, but one who is intelligent enough he searches after eternal life. The modern civilization does not understand what is eternal life. They are busy with the spot life of 50 or 100 years. Fools cannot think that one is not for 50 or 100 years, but one is for eternity.

Krishna consciousness is the life of eternity and I am glad you are interested in it. So I am sending you beads chanted by me and your name is Nandakisora Brahmacari. Please follow the rules and regulations and ask Brahmananda about these rules and regulations. He will help you.

Krishna consciousness is the process of eternal life. The process is simple and the results are sublime. You follow it and you will be happy in this life as well as in the next.

I do not know whether you sent me these beads from N.Y. with stamped envelope; if you sent it, that is all right. Otherwise someone has sent them and I am missing his name. Anyway you can chant on these beads and inquire if anyone is missing his beads. Then I can send another (if these are not sent by you.)

Hope you are well,

Your ever well-wisher,
