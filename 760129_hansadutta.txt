My dear Hansadutta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated January, 23, 1976.

Your struggle in Germany is the struggle between Hiranyakasipu and Prahlada Maharaja, and Prahlada Maharaja must come out triumphant. When there is so much interference on the part of Kamsa, Krishna must come out victorious, and kill Kamsa.

Yes, begin the bus program village to village, distributing kirtana, prasadam and books. That will make our foundation strong.

Just pray to Krishna for help. Krishna will come out triumphant without any doubt.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
