My dear Kuladri,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 7, 1976 along with a check for $1,111. Thank you very much.

Yes, I was there in Buffalo, it is nice. Nitai Gaura is there. It is a very good opportunity. Take advantage and do it nicely. Surely Nitai Gaura will give you strength.

Upon your recommendation I will accept the following devotees as my initiated disciples. Please be sure that they know and follow the four regulative principles and that they always chant at least 16 rounds daily trying to avoid the 10 offenses. Hold a fire ceremony and have Kirtanananda Maharaja chant on their beads. Their new names are as follows:

Charles Vogler---Cakrapani dasa

Bernald Ely---Vallabha Caitanya dasa

Mary Tepas---Manasvini dasi

Theresa Pericola---Tilakaini dasi

Brenda Moffit---Bhaktinistha dasi

Pat Lawrence---Prema-manjari dasi

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
