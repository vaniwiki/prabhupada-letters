Baltimore

My dear Abhirama,

Please accept my blessings. With further reference to my letter dated 31st August, 1971, I have already asked you to consult with the GBC members before purchasing the boat. So do not purchase this boat unless all the GBC members agree. I understand that some of the GBC members are not favorably disposed to this proposal of purchasing a boat. In one letter I have read "Otherwise there is so much chance of misuse. For example I have heard from Satsvarupa that the President of Baltimore Temple has $10,000.00 with which he wants to purchase a boat to go to South America. Obviously this is misappropriation and could be avoided if all these kinds of funds were immediately centralized". So in this regards do not purchase this boat without unanimous consent of the GBC members.

Hoping this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
