My dear Jagatikanda dasi,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to thank you for your letter dated October 15th, 1975, which has only just now arrived.

I thank you for your kind donation and for your willing service attitude. The disciple is always thinking how he or she can better serve the spiritual master, and the spiritual master is always thinking how to help his disciple to surrender to Krishna. Please continue the process of Krishna Consciousness with full enthusiasm and patience and there is no doubt Krishna will surely accept you.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
