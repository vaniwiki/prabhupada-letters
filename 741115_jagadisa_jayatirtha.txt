My Dear Jagadisa, Jayatirtha, and

Dayananda dasa:

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated November 1, 1974 and have noted the contents. So for maintaining the Gurukula at least the cost price for the books must be paid. Gurukula can take the profit for its maintenance. BBT cannot pay for maintenance of the temples. BBT can only pay for printing and temple properties and construction.

Why are the Spiritual Sky accounts being serviced by Los Angeles rather than by the Dallas devotees?

I hope this meets you all in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
