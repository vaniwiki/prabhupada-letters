Calcutta

My dear Gargamuni,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter from Calcutta dated September 5, 1972, and I have noted the contents carefully. Yes, you wait there for me and be engaged as you are doing, chanting, reading, etc. Nobody is your enemy, rest assured. All of your godbrothers are as good as you are. So you remain peacefully in Calcutta and you shall remain with me when I come there, and nobody will disturb you.

Hoping this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

N.B. It may be that on my way to India, I may drop at South Africa where Rsi Kumar Goswami is working. If I go there, I may call you in South Africa which is reported to be very very prospective.
