My dear Sudama,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated June 2, 1975 and have noted the contents. Last time, when I saw you in Hawaii, and I saw that you had become mad, I was very surprised how you had become like that. So, I prayed to Krishna to bring you back. Now, be very careful. Don't make any mistakes. Keep company with Bhavananda. He is very sincere. Also keep Gargamuni with you. Now, the scholarly section of society is accepting our philosophy. Perhaps you have seen Professor Judah's book. So, we have got so many things to do, strictly on Lord Caitanya's principle.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
