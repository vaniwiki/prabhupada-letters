My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated Nov. 5, including the air waybill but before this, I had cleared the record player paying a duty of 120.oo Rs. So there is no more any chance of getting back this money. But your timely dispatching the machine is very much appreciated by Krishna and I thank you very much for this prompt service. Regarding your telegram; I may inform you that I am starting sometime next week. I shall inform you as soon as I book my ticket of my time of arrival (ETA). Regarding your business, I have seen many merchants who will supply us incense, frankincense, saris, musical instruments, dancing ghungru (jingle bells for feet) etc. Hope you are well

Your ever well-wisher\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
