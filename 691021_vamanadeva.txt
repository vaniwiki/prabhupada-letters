My dear Vamanadeva,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated October 14, 1969 and have noted the contents carefully. If you can open a center with Indira Dasi, that will be a great pleasure for me. I want that all married couples should open new centers and carry on by dint of hard labor. Every householder, husband and wife together, they require to live in an apartment, so if they have got an extra room, they can immediately start a center. You have seen in Hawaii how Gaurasundara and Govinda are gradually developing from this beginning to a nice center in Hawaii. Wherever we sit down and chant Hare Krishna people will gather and gradually become our devotees and thus the center is developed. So if you want to open a center, that is very good. But at the same time you must be able to measure your strength whether you will be able to do it. In the meantime Columbus center may require your services, so you may remain there, and when you feel strong you can do it with Krishna's blessings. But if you do it sincerely and seriously, you will be successful. In Japan Sudama and his wife are doing very nicely, and I have got encouraging letter that Bali Mardan is desiring to go to Australia to open a temple. Also, Suridas and his wife, Jotilla, with others have gone to Paris. As formerly the Europeans made colonization in different parts of the world, it is the same thing; colonization of Sankirtana in Krishna Consciousness.

Please offer my blessings to your good wife, Indira Dasi. I hope this will meet you both in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
