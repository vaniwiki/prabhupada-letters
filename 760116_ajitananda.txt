My dear Ajitananda,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 25th, 1976. Considering your problem I will advise you to chant on your lips since you become tired chanting out loud. Also you can sit and hear your Godbrothers chanting. And you can also hear tapes. Do all of these and there should be no problem.

Hoping this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
