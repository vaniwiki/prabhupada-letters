ALL GLORIES TO SRI GURU AND GAURANGA!

My dear Karnamrta,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated November 30, 1973 along with the Vaisnava poem.

Your humble attitude is very much appreciated by me. Always chant Hare Krsna and as far as possible help me push on this movement by preaching this philosophy and distributing our books.

Yes, you may go to India and on your way you may stop in Los Angeles and visit me. I shall be very happy to see you.

I hope this meets you well.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
