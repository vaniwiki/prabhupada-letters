New Vrndavana

My dear Kirtanananda Swami,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter dated May 23, 1975 and have noted the contents. Your report is very nice to hear. If you give the right protection to the cows, then they will give so much milk, that the ground of New Vrndavana will be muddy with milk. European and American civilization will be finished on account of this sinful activity of killing the cows. Actually, one should not circumambulate when the Deity is open. It is stated in the Nectar of Devotion. I think you can close the doors to the Deity room during Tulasi puja and then open them again afterwards.

Regarding my coming to New Vrndavana, yes, I can stay there for the month of August. That will be very nice.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
