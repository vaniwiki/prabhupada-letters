My dear Nrsimha Caitanya Das,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due reciept of your letter dated October 12th, 1974, with enclosed letter from Saunaka Dasa Brahmacari. I am very glad to read of all the wonderful activities in Krishna Consciousness that you are engaging in in San Diego. I can understand that you are managing a very nice temple there. The temple is meant to invite everyone to come and take shelter of the Lord. The temple is the opportunity for all conditioned souls to render some service t Krishna either in the matter of Hearing, Chanting, Offering, Cleansing, Reading or taking prasadam. Therefore you are by managing the temple as a president you are doing a very great service to humanity. So please continue in this way and make it nicer and nicer. I am also glad to note that you are distributing the books in increasing numbers. We want that our book distribution should be increased more and more in the coming year.

Regarding the devotees whom you have recommended for initiation I am pleased to accept them as my disciples. Their spiritual names are as follows: Mike---Mahahasaumya Dasa. Ken---Ksamaula Dasa. Karen---Kriyasakti Devi Dasi. Dilana---Duravanya Devi Dasi. I am also please to accept Saunaka Dasa Brahmacari as twice born initiated Brahman. Enclosed is the sacred thread sanctified by me as well as the mantra sheet. Please hold a sacrifice and the Gayatri mantra can be heard by him through the right ear of my recorded type.

I hope this meets you in good health,

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
