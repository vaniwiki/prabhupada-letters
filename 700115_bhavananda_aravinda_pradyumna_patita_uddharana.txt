My dear Bhavananda, Aravinda, Pradyumna and Patita Uddharana,

Please accept my blessings. I am so much thankful to you all for sending me the first blue print copy of __"Isopanisad".__ It is so nicely done that I am fully satisfied although there are certain discrepancies which I hope will be revised in our next issue. On the whole it is very nice considering the attempt being all first adventure of our boys.

I am specifically drawing the attention of Patita Uddharana that you may write articles whenever you find time and hand them over to Satsvarupa for publishing in our BTG.

Hope this meets all of you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
