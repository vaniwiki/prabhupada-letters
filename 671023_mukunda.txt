====== Letter to: Mukunda ======

My dear Mukunda,

Please accept my blessings. I am in due receipt of your letter of Oct 16 with great pleasure. Now I feel certain that you will get my immigration visa, in the meantime as I have already informed you I've gotten a visitors visa immediately on presenting passport. So please let me know whether I should wait for the immigration visa as you intend to send me or should I start on the strength of the visitors visa. On the whole now I can start any day I like but if you think I should wait I shall wait. You must write me immediately. I'm leaving Calcutta the day after tomorrow for Navadvipa, the birth place of Lord Caitanya and my address is given on the overleaf (please find). You will reply this letter to my Navadvipa address and on hearing from you I will do the needful.

When coming from San Francisco I promised to Janaki and other girls that this time when I come back I shall first come to San Francisco. So I shall return by Pacific route and possibly make a break in the journey in Tokyo and Hawaii. I have duly received the copies of your correspondence with SS Brijbasi. I understand that there was no mistake on your part. Along with your letter I have the note of Janaki's Aunt Edna. Please convey my greetings and good wishes to her. She may remain there with you till my return. I have duly received your telegram as well.
