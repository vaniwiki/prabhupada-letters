Calcutta

My dear Tamala Krishna,

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 29th, December, 1970, and noted the contents.

In the meantime, our program in Surat is going on very well. I have just finalized the arrangements for my coming to Calcutta and you may revise the information sent in my previous letter dated December 30th, as follows:

We shall fly by IA flight Number IC-175, departing Bombay on the Fifth January at 5:30 PM (17.30) reaching Calcutta by 7:45 PM (19.45). Please arrange for our reception.

Hope this will meet you in good health.

Your ever well-wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami

P.S. Regarding Hamilton house, if we are certain that the tenant will vacate just after one & half year, then we can purchase the house. If there is no such certainty then it will be risky job.
