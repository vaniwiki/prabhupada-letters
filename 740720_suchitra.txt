New Vrindaban

My dear Suchitra devi dasi:

Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your very nice letter and I thank you very much for your kind sentiments. I understand that you are the mother of the little boy Purnima das. He is very nice boy. He is Vaisnava. So you are very fortunate to have such a son. You can take it that Krsna has given you this son. So you must take care of him nicely and raise him in Krishna consciousness. All these boys must be taken care of very nicely. They are the future hope. When he is ready, he must be taught English and Sanskrit.

I hope this meets you in good health.

Your ever well wisher,\\
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
